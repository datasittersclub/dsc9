            " money. If you have ever wanted a real job — especially after you'd married your first — you could imagine this was all going to blow up. I'd already decided to live in New York. I had already moved into a very cool apartment — which, in turn, meant I was ready to go to work for someone else. (That's what it is. This is a New York City neighborhood.) I sat across from John H. Sullivan, a writer for The New York Times. Mr. Sullivan was sitting next to him on his way to see his doctor-bob appointments. When I asked him if he knew anyone who would have any jobs, he said he had no idea. I asked him what, after a few years, he would do. \"I'll sit down with my friends,\" he said. I told him about the two new jobs. \"I got a big fat raise, but I can't find one,\" he said. I told him what I was getting into when I told him about the job.\n",
            "\n",
            "The next day, though, things were a lot different. As soon as Sullivan gave up hope of staying at one of New York's best restaurants, he said he'd give up, too — he'd become very depressed and couldn't keep up. I could only tell by his look at his friends, which was sad. I'd heard that he'd moved a lot from New York City in his eight-month-old baby-sitting life, but that was too bad: he'd moved to California five years earlier. He loved California. He'd been so good at basketball that he earned the nickname \"Elmer.\" But life in California is more challenging, and Mr. Sullivan had become a real estate agent. I was already seeing him for the first time. Even though he'd moved a bunch of stuff around during his eight months in California, he was still very happy in California.\n",
            "\n",
            "I said, \"You better wait a minute then. It could be all right. Here I am after a day off,\" and Mr. Sullivan started calling me and telling me that he'd moved some toys around to keep us entertained.\n",

(Her book The New York Times Year of the Times: Life, Times and the News is out now.) That made her even more beloved, since she lives up, and she has so much in common with Mr. Sullivan with her boyfriend, Richard.\n",

            "Anyway, there it is. Mr. Sullivan got married. Then I got married. And Mr. Sullivan got an Oscar. All in all, the ceremony was a lot of fun. (I also saw my two best friends, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, take the best picture of Mr. Brown I could find — a photo of Mr. Brown sitting on his lap in the restaurant in California. Then I met David Brant, and I fell in love.)\n",
            "\n",
            "The ceremony was the first of many. As it turns out, Mr. Sullivan and Mrs. Brown had never heard of each other until they moved to New York City in July of 1982.

Eliza is really, really sweet, and Emily is the kind of girl who just can't stand being around other people anymore.\n",

Watson Brewer is the father of two kids in a much bigger family now. His stepfather is Watson’s mom. They split up because the Thomases don’t want to give up Dawn and Mary Anne’s Mary Anne.

Nowadays she lives in a style much more organized than Kristy’s. If I were to list all the things Kristy has changed, I’d be in the middle of a column. For instance, those extra thick red eyes on Claud’s brown hair, the habit of fixing it every day with mascara and pencils and stuff. Or her father’s job, which he’d gone into overprotective over the last year. I mean, you’ve probably already done that. Now I’ll add Claudia, Claud’s best friend, who had a very helpful, casual lunch at Claudia’s until she moved back to New York. Claudia is Kristy’s junk food lover (believe me, I adore her Chez R\n",

Kristy was also the first of us to have a steady boyfriend. His name is Logan Bruno and he’s seventeen years old, and he’s the oldest of eight kids.

Claudia is responsible for keeping track of our clients’ addresses, phone numbers, allergies, special allergies, and so forth. She writes down the names, phone numbers, the wages earned, plus the important information about our clients: the addresses and phone numbers of our baby-sitting charges, their children’s ages, and so forth.

She used to belong to the BSC, but we were all snobby about Claudia’s phone call and her late arrival date on our meetings. Dawn claims she made some kind of bigoted remark in a BSC meeting, but it doesn’t amount to anything but gross ignorance. (Most of us treat her like a little girl.) Dawn and I aren’t perfect people. Some of the people I’ve mentioned so far are jerks, but we are equals. We’re pretty close, in fact. We have a lot in common, such as the clothes we wear and the way we dress. But even we’re different, besides personality, we’re sensitive. Especially Dawn, who’s the shyest, most sensitive of us.

Mrs. Thomas had two younger siblings, a younger stepsister, and a divorced mom. (Mary Anne and her husband live in an old farmhouse with a secret passage in it.) Also, after the divorce, Mary Anne and Mr. Thomas moved into Watson's mansion!

For example, all of the girls I've talked to think the club should be run with a drawbridge, a fake sign in place of the telephone, and a fake elevator by the way. Guess what. They're right. The main thing that the club should be run from is advertising. We need to spread the word to the children that we sit for that we offer fliers and to children that we stop holding our jobs for non-affiliate groups.\n",

            "I think it's funny that the BSC, which is mainly run by Kristy, would be a great place to start a baby-sitting business. They're not, unfortunately, a baby-sitting business, but they do advertise lots. In fact, they do so often enough, especially if the job is advertised, on TV, or even at a local inn. Kristy wants to make sure the BSC can serve all our clients well, and we do appreciate that.\n",
            "\n",
            "The other thing that Kristy wants the BSC to work on is organization. To her, being organized seems like a chore, and I think she's probably a terrible organizer because she's great at it. In fact, no one bothers to ask her what she does, just that she's a great listener and always willing to help us out. Kristy's parents got divorced, and Kristy's dad still lives in the house Kristy used to live in, so he's still very much an important part of the neighborhood. Plus, he's so involved in school that he has to turn down all our extracurricular activities because he's so moved.\n",

Maybe that’s why she’s the only one in the club who actually enjoys hanging out with the Krushers. She’s not interested in sports; she loves any other kind of food: cookies, cakes, fruit, cheese.

It was no big a job (maybe even no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-va-way through) so I don’t really know who she was just now, but I do know she was pretty good. And so far as I can tell, she’s been attending meetings (on Mondays) with Dawn and Stacey, either from time to time or for Mary Anne or one of the other club members.

(Personally, I'd kill for someone with those organizational skills, but I bet they don't.) Jessi's the only person in my club who goes to a private school. She's the only club member who wears a uniform — jumpers, tights, pullovers, whatever. Jessi's also the only member with a steady boyfriend. (If she did, I'd have to check with her to see if she had one on, but not today.) We don't pick up on the extra machoness by looking at her looks alone. Jessi is a serious, extra-serious dresser. She puts together the most stunning outfits in her closet. She claims to have divided the BSC gym bags from cupcakes.\n",

We'd be wild for each other, too, since both of us are pretty short. But Jessi and I are much more like Mal — more worldly and pretty young. We're also somewhat of a shock to the other. We're not sure yet what kind of a person Jessi is. Maybe she's a tomboy who dances the violin. Or she could come from Europe and dance en pointe. We don't see much of either of them often, though, because their families and houses are very different.\n",

            "Mal, on the other hand, is a naturalized U.S. citizen. That's because she was born in New Jersey. Her parents, however, thought the state would be too difficult for her. They decided it would be easier if she lived with her grandparents, though. Mal's family has three younger brothers and sisters, including a set of identical triplets. They live in Mal's neighborhood every other weekend and another with her aunt. Their house is across the street from ours.\n",

During her lifetime she has access to all kinds of interesting, creative, and unexpected treats. The first of these was food: a chocolate cupcake, a pretzel, a fudge-daddy bar, a chocolate-covered chocolates trifle. Mal acquired all these things when her dad couldn't find any. She doesn't remember him, but it must have made her sad.\n",

He or she is busy with several extracurricular activities. I’ll tell you what I do — in terms of sports. I try to keep at least one close eye on all our jobs. For instance, at a BSC meeting.

And her outfit choice: a vest with a belt or some combination of the two, a purple crisscross skirt with great purplish blisters under it, and a great white turquoise hat with a little sparkly purplish dot in the middle.

I can start a game between five-minute periods in any given night just by looking at Claud’s digital clock. That’s because one of her very first jobs in the BSC was making notes on a school notebook. She figured out when I could sit, set up a rule, and then stick it straight in the notebook. For example, if I was watching a movie with a lot of people watching one guy only to find out later that one of the others had already sat for the same people at a different movie.

Her position meant that she would attend meetings as often as she could, with the regular club members taking over Jessi's job. But Stacey had to leave her best friend, Mary Anne Spier, and join us, too. They have been a huge part of helping us out a lot lately. Stacey and Jessi left because they felt we weren't filling in the blanks correctly, or they didn't have the right people lined up.

You have to have some structure to pull together different things. For example, you need to think up some new organizing idea for the club. Maybe the Baby-sitters Club was once a group that solved a problem. Kristy helped me develop an idea for the Baby-sitters Club, and I'm glad I did it.

We also keep the notebook in order so that we can stay up-to-date on what's happening with our charges.

So there was a lot of moving to do. Kristy’s mother worked hard, so she met and fell in love with Watson Brewer, one of the men I mentioned earlier. After Watson, Kristy’s life changed dramatically. Just when she looked like a normal, fifteen-year-old, blonde, with blue eyes, blond-haired sister, and blue-eyed brother, her parents began moving out of their house. Mrs. Thomas met Watson and married him. Over time she’s been brought back together by her new family, and the Thomases have become a very happy family. Kristy’s brother, though, wasn’t happy, either, since he missed his brother. So Mrs. Thomas met Watson and made some changes to her life. For example, she got married to a guy named Watson Brewer, who just happens to be a millionaire. Now Kristy lives in a mansion across town, and he has loosened up a bit.

For example, if a kid is going to be in trouble, she needs to know exactly who’s available. Then she’s in charge of providing that information, making appointments and then recording the money we earn.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, unlike at our regular meetings, when a parent calls us with a demanding job, Mom needs to know exactly when and for what time. That’s why she’s in charge of the treasury envelope. She keeps the contents of the envelope, along with the names of the responsible adult (the one who took the money), the rate we’ll charge (if we earn enough money, that is), and important information — the entire reason for getting the job.\n",

            "One last thing about us. Our meeting hours are from five-thirty to six. That’s because we’re all BSC members, but you know what? Some of us are holiday baby-sitters, while the rest of us are holiday go-baks.\n",
            "\n",
            "We also have a club notebook, in which we each write about every single job we go on. The notebook is like a journal, with notes about every single job we go on. This is a great way to keep track of what’s happening with our clients. It’s a great way to keep track of the lives of our very own, and of keeping track of who may be at a particular job.\n",

            "\n",
            "It’s a good thing we have a club record book, because we keep one handy and tidy, all the time. The record book contains all our notes, information about our clients, and a description of our schedules. In it, we also keep an up-to-date set of client names, addresses, and phone numbers, as well as one calendar with information on each job. It’s a huge work, but it’s a lot of work if your baby-sitting job is going to have to spend as much time doing our things as we do.\n",

You see, he's back from a month or so gone by now. He had shown up to the meeting for an interview, and you already knew that.

Her family is big: Her mom, Becca, and her younger brother, Jeff, grew up with all these different families, but they have become so complicated that they needed each other to deal with growing up.
