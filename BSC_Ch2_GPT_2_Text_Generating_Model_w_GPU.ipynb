For instance, Mary Anne's father had remarried his former wife's mother, who had just left him (actually, Mary Anne had remarried Mrs. Thomas just when she wasn't as convinced that he had remarried Ms. Thomas. But not before telling her her that he hated me!). Since then he'd lived in a mansion in Stoneybrook's South End. But he didn't move into the house that Mary Anne and her father had once shared, since it was in a much larger house. Instead, he had bought it (and owned) a small house on Watson's new lot. That meant that after Watson remarried his former wife's mom (whose house is in another mansion), he had to leave the house the same night. And he had to pay rent on the house.

She can cook up a zillion recipes, but somehow, from scratch, she thinks all those ingredients must be in the food processor (KitchenAid, I say). Plus, she's always experimenting with special foods — pretzels, corn crackers, cookies, and even a version called Granola Milk Chocolate Chunkie. Her favorites are pretzels, chocolate-chip cookies, and chocolate-chip cakes. But for today, she had the granola cake. The image of a pecan-shaped cake on a plate came to life, right on top of her normal sized-for-girl asthma. (Kristy's asthma also keeps her coughing and sneezing uncontrollably.

In her absence, Mary Anne has been busy writing and illustrating her own stories, so she'll have a great shot at honing her craft every time.

It's a condition in which the body doesn't process starches correctly, so the sugars in blood don't form the necessary amount of \"munchies\" for normal functions. That's something Claud's room for all too well. She's not great with people, but she's understanding and caring. She has a younger sister, Janine, but a huge family. Also a stepbrother, a stepbrother-in-law, a stepsister-to-be, and a baby sister, Emily Michelle. If all those people could be handled correctly, Claud would have no doubt grown up to an incredible adult. But not Claudia. She falls in the \"neat\" category on that scale. Not only does she have a younger sister and sister-in-law, but she's the most gifted of all of us in the club. She's already written a couple of articles about the BSC, and she has a couple of acting jobs lined up. Claudia is also a junk food gourmet, something our parents will probably approve of, but not so fast that they let her eat things she doesn't need (such as pretzels or Doritos for us). Claudia is also the vice-president of the club, mainly because we meet in her bedroom almost every night. Our other vice-president is that she doesn't take much office. (She's in charge of the treasury, which is what our treasurer, Janine, commiserates about.) But she's a good officer, and a kind of fun for the club. She's the club's secretary, which is a labor of love. She keeps the client list up-to-date, and she's in charge of the record book, in which we keep track of our schedules and clients' names and addresses and even their likes and dislikes.

But considering that Claud herself is quite stubborn (I'll explain this later), she does seem sort of stubborn as well, and a lot of her acting and spelling comes down to her biology — which is not exactly clear. Claud's mother is almost as stubborn about her giving her what she wants now as she is about her giving later. Claud has a great understanding of rules and regulations. Her father lets her do what she wants — and no more, I guess, than she can. (I've said it before, but she likes to have plenty of leeway with her hair.

She'll probably need to do a thorough photo study before she can imagine the ghost, and then she'll run down to the museum to check out her work.

In a way, I guess that makes her the baby-sitter of the century. Kristy has brown hair, brown eyes, and is the shortest girl in our class. I have trouble believing she’s the shortest girl in our whole class. (Don’t you have to have the shortest hair? The shortest walk in the bookstore.) Kristy’s easygoing is her family. She grew up in a house across the street from Claudia’s, but she was raised in a very modest household.\n",

Dawn is an incredible athlete; she also has great pale skin and big brown eyes. She goes to a private school called Stoneybrook Day School (usually). She also has a loving family: her parents, her younger sister Janine, her baby brother, Squirt (a nickname from the popular TV show “Stoneybrook and the Hogs of Troy”), and her aunt Cecelia (her real name is Nannie). If the four of them are anywhere near ready to be sisters, there may also be a school in Watson’s Park named Day School, but that school isn’t until seventh grade. It doesn’t offer K-12, so Dawn and Mary Anne still attend Stoneybrook Middle School.\n",

She is also secretary of the BSC, which means she keeps the record bookkeeping secret from the rest of us. She also runs the meetings, check our schedules, and answer any baby-saying calls that come in. The club record book is Mary Anne’s bedroom, and so are our first-aid kits. She has never, ever bitten someone with a hammer or scintillating the air with a hot pad.\n",

She then leaned forward, looking at my gun. You see, Mom and Dad used to be kind of like Chardonnay and Twinkies. I can't remember what they looked like, but it sure was cool. Which was perfect, I guess. When Mom and Dad opened up a bedroom, did they show us their guns? Or did each of them keep his or her full magazine clip? (We all have magazines, so I guess that makes sense. But it's not as if they didn't know my mom and me from TV or the movies or hand-me-down books at the local store.)\n",

Right.)\n",

            "Anyway, so Mom and I weren't looking forward to seeing Tigger for a while. At least not before we got our hands on some new gunpowder. When Mom calls my father's pet Pumpkin Spice, the word \"pumpkin\" means \"to crush\" or \"thieve\" in French, which is what our father and I are from the old days. At that time, there were two pairs of ears in one. Now there are four pairs of ears in the pumpkin-pistol-thieving sense — which is, opposites. Mom and I think my new ear is the best-fitting ear for it now, but it's still a little on the big side. I bet the Paddocks have another pair of ears, too.\n",

            "Speaking of which, is Dad the most absent-mindedly absentminded in this whole family? He always complains. I think it's because he's too busy trying to impress Mom and me with his soft Southern accent and his casual clothes (my T-shirt, my buttonless vest, the Look, plus this great baseball cap with this picture of the team's player on it). But it must be because the West Coast has a weird thing for men. Mr. and Mrs. McLellandens lived in California, where I live, when I was born.\n",

            "\n",
            "So the parents sold their house and moved to Connecticut, where they cliqueed and named all their kids after each other.

Jessi had to make a major adjustment last year when her father was transferred back to Stoneybrook from somewhere called “incompetent” care. That’s why she has a job — as long as she doesn’t “crazy hour” on Wednesday.\n",

Her parents are divorced; her aunt and uncle are Stacey and Carolyn; her younger sister, Becca, is seventh-graders; and her baby brother, Squirt, her sister, Charlotte, and her mom, Liz, each attend eighth grade. Jessi’s family is pretty huge, with an almost ten-year-old house and a swimming pool, and lots of running shoes. That’s what I thought, but I was surprised when I heard back home that Jessi loved sports. She really has to coach the younger kids, but her best friend is an athlete. She’s a karate-possessed eighth-grader who participates in spring training several times a week. Jessi’s younger sister, Becca, is in high school, but she gets up early the day after school to take extra lessons so she can get better and practice a lot.\n",

What Kristy couldn’t get a job did: be quiet; also act as a sister; and be totally cool. That was fine with me, because I like cool.

Stacey lives with her mom and her dad, but they raise her only on their own. (Her real name is Anastasia Elizabeth McGill, and her family moved here from New York City when the McGills were there. They were also close to their father, who was a nice guy in New York when the McGills were still only twelve. And when Stacey lived here in Stoneybrook with her mom and her dad and her sister, this wonderful, cool guy named Watson Brewer named Charlie, whom Stacey and I would hang out with almost as much as we did then. We’d also made up with Stacey’s real nieces and nephews, who were Stacey’s other adopted siblings, who were also our baby-sitting children. It was wonderful! But this isn’t to say Stacey isn’t a strong person. She’s not. She’s an excellent student, which explains the absence of Dawn.

My friends and I like to call our meetings when we need baby-sitters (we hold our meetings on Wednesdays and Stoneybrook Day weekends), and we plan some kind of BSC meeting for the kids we sit for.

I think she could have a good life if she just used her mother and her time and energies and was responsible enough to keep her peace of mind and focused on her job.

It was Kristy's idea to form the BSC not long ago, and she herself is a member now. Kristy's a big southerner, sort of a conservative, with a southern accent, but here's how she became the president: Kristy came from a New Jersey neighborhood, grew up on Long Island (where Kristy's father lives), and quit her house job at the end of seventh grade. Then, shortly after she met David Michael, she and David Michael moved to Stoneybrook. Kristy used to live on Long Island, but then her dad was transferred back to New Jersey so Kristy got a new family of eight. That's how Kristy and David Michael became friends. Now they all live in the new house, along with Young Anne, whom they like a lot. They also have pets, plus Kristy has two goldfish.

The other is Kid-Kits, which are cardboard cartons crammed with books, games, toys, and stickers and markers (I almost always go to the Kid-Kits) that no one is collecting.

For one thing, the BSC did begin life as a three-person super-organized group with Kristy, Mary Anne (who was president), Stacey (chiefly because she's Kristy's best friend), and me. That first meeting was sort of a success: we had more business than we could handle. That Saturday, instead of sticking to one phone call we'd called three times in the past two months, we'd begun making suggestions.

She puts them on every week and wears them day after day.) Kristy’s pierced ears come with brown-and-white-striped contacts, and she usually wears glasses but isn’t interested in mascara (she loves them so much that she’s once told me that mascara is the clearst kind of thing.)

Looking around the club record book, while I was thinking about all the great club cards I could ever get signed, Mary Anne and I found ourselves standing room only. At first we were a little surprised — we’ve been big fans of Mary Anne’s in our other positions for so long, there’s no way anyone could have been late for our meeting. But as we told our fears, we discovered that we’d been friends for a long time, and that Mary Anne and I really like each other.\n",

Mr. Spier never got over his old ways and father so Mary Anne fell in love and married him, married her mother, and moved into his farmhouse. In less than a year, the family had grown to about twenty kids. (Once again, she has to foot Trevor’spet’spetty.)\n",

Back when Mary Anne was only in seventh grade, Dawn and Mary Anne were best friends. But things changed. Now Dawn is married again — and, boy, is that a big change. Dawn is pretty new to the BSC, but she and Mary Anne seem to hold each other together. Dawn has reddish-brown hair, and freckles, and dresses in a variation of the Casual Dress uniform (the same as our regular members except for a few things): jeans, pullover sweaters, T-shirts, and penny loafers. She's a fabulous tie-dye artist, and she lives with her parents and Jeff, her older sister, for a while. Then there was this big, tall change. We began to see Sharon Ritz, Mary Anne's best friend, get a steady boyfriend. That was the beginning of the end. That was my first boyfriend (Mary Anne had thought he was already dead by the time we started dating), and I fell in love again with him. In California, at first I didn't like him at first, but things have improved a lot in the last year or so. Anyway, I finally told Dawn what had happened. \"What?\" I asked.\n",

            "A few minutes later, Kristy and Claudia and Mary Anne and Stacey and Dawn and I were on our way to Claudia's forodball game, a game they call a \"club\" (another Kristy example). It's a kind of old-school boardgame where two people hold a club record book and try to find a certain number of rules for each job. The record book contains everyone's jobs — house rules, for example, who gets to do what, how much, how many kids, who’s in the toys, etc. — and also all of our schedules. Then, the phone could ring several hundred times for the phone to ring. That’s the way Kristy, who is the president of the BSC, is organized.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kristy is a born leader. She has tons of personality. You would not believe her on-air comments, or her quick-wittedness in big problems and big problems’s, or her use of the “emergency!” word (which is usually a polite way for the phone to be answered). This is a trait that you should see and understand about her. She’s a little kid, mostly, but she’s behaved herself in a very grown-up way. For instance, she made a conscious decision not to have her ears pierced, and she’s changed her mind about her braces.\n",
            "\n",
            "Claudia, on the other hand, is pretty. She’s totally cool. She wears her hair long, her face painted a million different ways, and she tends to experiment with her earrings. I guess you’d have to call her jewelry a “unique combination” if you wanted to attract a studious crowd.\n",
            "\n",
            "Claudia, as you might guess, is the club vice-president. She’s also treasurer. That’s what she does because she’s a math whiz, but more importantly, she’s a fun person. She’s outgoing and hilarious. (That Monday, for example, she was so excited I couldn’t help laughing.) She’s also a member of the Baby-sitters Club, one of the founding clubs of the Baby-sitters Club, and the BSC.\n",
            "\n",
            "Claudia and I have been friends for a long time. We even went to the same school. We were both in high school, but before long, the two of us really hit it off. Soon we were junior officers in a big baby-sitting club called the Baby-sitters Club (or BSC). Mary Anne and I were called junior officers, but after we graduated, we were sent back to our old selves.\n",
            "\n",
            "In my case, the BSC was more like a business than a club. It worked like a charm, getting jobs to sit for kids we didn’t know were in trouble. Then, when we were organized enough to handle plenty of clients, they were able to fill my shoes.\n",
            "\n",
            "In fact, I was so excited when I heard that Claudia, Stacey, Dawn, and I were going to be junior officers that we even took on some of our own kids. Claudia is an excellent artist. She has her own unique way of looking at things. She brings her artistic talents to her outfits, her hair, her jewelry. And she puts them to good use. In fact, I couldn’t be more excited about Claudia than I was about Stacey.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since Claudia wears her hair the way she does, maybe it’s no surprise that she’s a student of fashion. She’s very creative. Claudia can create wild outfits that rival the money in her closet. For instance, today she had on black pants, a black hair cut behind her ear, and a black leotard that matched her leotard top to bottom. She’d tied it all together with a hair-making contest she was putting in the works.\n",
            "\n",
            "And that outfit was soooooo cool. Not just cool. It was awesome. Claudia was even going to wear it with a black hair-dancer shirt that she’d made herself out of tights and a white leotard. The shirt would be too tight, she’d say, and the hair would be white. That’s because she’d sculpted the hair into a dancer’s leotard.\n",
            "\n",
            "She’d also used papier-mâché to tie it all together. And she’d dyed the hair blonde. It was awesome.\n",
            "\n",
            "Stacey McGill, who was sitting with Mallory Pike and Jessi Ramsey, was the only one of us to have our phone with a private number in it. That’s important, because sometimes a private line is always better than a mob phone. The Ramsey family has\n"
