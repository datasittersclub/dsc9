# DSC 9: The Ghost in Anouk's laptop

This is the repo for [DSC #9: The Ghost in Anouk's Laptop](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc9.html). It has a [Jupyter notebook](GPT_2_fine_tuning_notebook_for_DSC9.ipynb) that you can download to your Google Drive and open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to see how we fine-tuned GPT-2 using the text from the chapter 2's of the *Baby-Sitters Club*. (Chapter 2 almost always contains a description of the club and characters, along with a few plot developments.)

If you [download the fine-tuned GPT-2 model that we trained](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqvgvv1cgil6the/checkpoint_dsc9.tar?dl=0), you can also use that notebook to generate new BSC-themed text, like we're doing for [our Twitter bot, @daily_dsc](https://twitter.com/daily_dsc).

We've also included here all the samples generated during our five runs of fine-tuning GPT-2, along with the random GPT-2-length samples from real *Baby-Sitters Club* chapter 2's that we used in DSC #9 to compare the output with the original text.
