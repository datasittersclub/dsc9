’ ve had the perfect time , ” she continued . `` I ’ m in the middle of studying for a job in Stamford. ” She paused . She was looking at me . “ What ’ s wrong , ” she said , “ a job coming up at the BSC ? ” Kristy was right . I like seeing Kristy do things the right way . Sometimes she tries , sometimes she doesn ’ t . She ’ s a decent student , and I think I do . Also , I like studying in class , which is great for me . But Kristy is not a serious student like , say , Dawn or Stacey . She just does what she pleases . She takes trouble , and sometimes it makes her happy . That ’ s the only downside . The next morning the phone had begun sending junk mail all over town . Claudia was so freaked out by it , that she canceled our next scheduled meeting ( which was later called back ) . Then Dawn called . I ’ d almost gone crazy about Mallory Pike and the Pikes . This was the moment I fell in love again with the Pike family . I had grown up with the Pike kids . I ’ d seen them grow up , and they were pretty different from the rest of my friends , when Mom , Dad , and I lived there . “ Dawn , ” I said , “ I ’ ll get to know her better. ” I closed the door and watched her get to work . She hung up the phone and looked at the mailbox . “ That ’ s my new baby-sitter , ” she went on . She cleared her throat and spoke so slowly I got the impression that she was talking just to give her a break . My best friend and BSC secretary , Shannon Kilbourne , looked at me . “ How ’ d the envelope go ? ” he asked . “ It was better than I ’ d expected , ” I replied , turning back to the clock . Shannon ’ s the secretary of the BSC and we keep the record book in our desk by the bed . We don ’ t have an official record book , either . But we know we each have information about our clients , and it ’ s up to us to keep a journal to report on those clients ’ progress ( so we can keep up-to-date with what ’ s going on with our charges through the rest of our lives ) . “ Who ’ s who , ” I remarked to Shannon . “ I wish I could go back to the BSC and pick up where I left off. ” Shannon was an associate member and not only doesn ’ t come to meetings , but is mostly interested in other things , such as the news , but also in school . She also takes care of our dues and keeps us in regular touch with our charges . The phone rang almost immediately . I answered it , and it was answered . “ Hello , Baby-sitters Club. ” I said . Shannon and Claudia are best friends , and the BSC had just gotten off the phone call my friends had made . The phone began to ring again . “ Duh , ” I protested . “ You said we were on the phone trying to find another child ! ” “ Why not , ” Kristy replied , “ when I called the treasurer so you could keep track of us and keep an eye on the funds in our treasurer account ? ” “ Oh , good , ” I said . “ I think we should make another call. ” “ Oh , I really need to call you back , ” Kristy replied . “ Right then ! ” Kristy nodded . “ I ’ d like to do it ! ” “ But it sounds too much like a waste of time , ” I protested . Kristy laughed . “ This is so dumb ! ” she cried . “ How about we call the treasurer , and he ’ ll see if we can work it out , right ? Anyway , you and I are on the phone right now trying to find a new baby-sitter for Wednesday. ” “ Oh , good , ” I remarked . “ It would be great to be late for school. ” “ Thanks. ” She hung up . “ That ’ s okay , Kristy. ” Claudia looked at her watch . “ Is it Monday ? ” “ I already told you , ” I replied . “ Yes , ” Claudia replied . “ Oh , well , no problem . But ” “ That would be great ,
