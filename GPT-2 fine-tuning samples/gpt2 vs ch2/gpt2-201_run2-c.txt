diary . She had to wear her long black hair pulled back in a tight bun . ( It was tied back from her waist with small , rounded leather galleons . ) She also did n't use her phone , because , well , we use hers . She also does n't have her own phone , and we do n't have a digital clock so her dad could call by SMS . I think her mother is the most understanding person I know , and that made a difference . She also had her own TV . She does n't have a digital radio , but I think that makes sense for the Baby-sitters Club and is great for her job . Mary Anne is tall , thin , and well-built . And in case you have n't noticed , she has diabetes ( a disease in which the pancreas controls sugar production ) . Mary Anne has this very serious form of diabetes . When she eats too many calories , she has to be very , very careful about what she eats . For example , do n't eat carrots or peas unless you are eating broccoli in a stir fry plate . And do n't eat red meat unless you are eating ham . Mary Anne is also very , very strict . She has no pretzels . ( She buys her own . ) She also does n't care what other people think about her . Mary Anne hates boys . She really hates boys , and she thinks of guys only when she can find one . I have never met Mary Anne , but that 's because she 's so different . Her personality is usually calm , thoughtful , sensitive , and thoughtful . She also has a lot of experience working . She 's an associate member of the BSC . Her real name is Claudia Kishi . She 's Mary Anne 's best friend , and I 'm not the only member of the club . We call her Kristy McGill , since she 's the only one with a steady boyfriend . Kristy McGill lives across the street from Claudia at the BSC . She used to be our alternate officer , but she 's pretty good , too . And she 's getting older , and that 's because Kristy and Claudia were best friends . They used to go to separate private school days , but the McGills have changed a lot since then . Claudia is an associate member . Let 's turn to Claudia 's room . Here 's how it works . When you open the door to the BSC meeting , you can notice an associate member in Claudia 's room . That member is Jessi Ramsey . And she 's the only one of us with a digital clock on her wall . She takes it up with the BSC phone . The clock in Claudia 's room always reflects the time , and there 's a simple digital symbol on it . `` AM '' stands for `` At the BSC Meetings . '' So , when we 're in Claudia 's room , a digital symbol would show up : Claudia 's BSC record book . This record book is another of us 's alternate officer jobs , which is where we meet now . It 's a great handy reference . Claudia has a really sophisticated painting and sculpture style , as well as a great sense of humor . Her art is both dramatic and poetic , as well as very personal . For a long time she felt inferior because the BSC did n't think she was smart enough . It was hard for her to adjust to Claudia 's world . She says it best when her mother says , `` You 've never had as much responsibility as Claudia . '' Claudia may not have as much responsibility because she has six brothers and sisters . For example , she has three younger brothers , one of whom is Richard . Claudia 's the only one who can sit for both Richard and Claudia once a week , and also the only BSC member who has a private tutor . Mary Anne and Claudia used to sit for both of them , but now they both have private lessons . Mary Anne 's mother takes care of her and I ’ m Kristy ’ s mom . Kristy and Claudia are best friends for a good reason , I think . They aren ’ t exactly alike and they share a lot of different ideas . Here 's how it works : When someone is home alone , they each fill in as soon as they find each other . We all do this , but Kristy and Mary Anne have to be super careful about who we sit for because they are identical twins . If any of us is alone , we 'll cry . If any of them is alone , we 'll faint . Our best friend ( otherwise known as Kristy ’ s alternate officer ) is also pretty important in the BSC , since we talk to each other like babies when we go on special trips . She ’ s also very quiet and shy . She ’ s not a problem baby-sitter , but she ’ s the one who lets us baby-sit in her room as often as we like . Kristy is also a vegetarian , since she does have junk food , so she ’ s not very strict about who comes and what . Kristy is our alternate officer because she is an only
