, the number one thing about being in charge of the club is that everybody has a job — including me . I am the club vice-president ; the treasurer ; Mr. Spier , Mr. Munchak and Mrs. Rodowsky ; Mary Anne Spier , the secretary ; and Vanessa — and they all like to be around kids . You should know that I do not usually come here for meetings . But in the case of the BSC and the club we do have some official duties around here . For example , they 'll help me if I need to know anything about the club , because we use the phone to call clients and we do have clients to call us if we 're not in town . When we 're not working we take baby-sitting jobs . The baby-sitting jobs don ’ t happen nearly often , though . In fact , if we were really busy , we probably wouldn ’ t be so busy . Anyway , the phone is ringing , and I stand up and wait as one of the members calls . I make an appointment . I ’ ll call Mrs. Rodowsky right back . I ’ ll do her the honor of ringing — to tell her about the client . That ’ s what I do . I make sure to tell her we ’ re happy to get a client , and then I ask the client ’ s name and the reason for sitting . That ’ s a great job — I know the client will be glad to know about the BSC , to hear about my company , and to fill in as often as I can . This is how you do it — call the client and arrange the duties . I keep the record record , except we don ’ t always make the schedule . ( It ’ s the business . I ’ m vice-president , treasurer , secretary of the club , and the person who collects dues . We do this because the club needs us to , and we have to do it ) . I take responsibility for everything , and I make the scheduling and the quality control decisions . ( We take all our paychecks from us and take the money out , which is necessary when we have kids . ) I am responsible for collecting dues every Monday ( which is why I make sure to do it ) and keeping track of our schedules ( because the club is Mary Anne ’ s ) . Plus , I always have an official record book , which I keep updated about the Kid-Kits we bring with us on our jobs . The bookkeeper is Kristy Thomas , who may or may not be absent , but it ’ s always there — in case we need anyone else . For instance , the record book says that the Thomas kids are allowed to take the Kid-Kits , and that the Kid-Kits are for them . It ’ s nice knowing Mrs. Thomas can rest easy knowing that she can take care of one of our younger brothers . And because it ’ s Kristy ’ s job to collect dues , it ’ s always a good idea to keep track of the schedules of our sitting jobs such as when the babies are born , and when we ’ re free to come to our own places . Finally , there ’ s the secretary . She goes to every meeting of the BSC , which is often a good thing . She ’ s the one who 's most reliable and reliable and trustworthy . She keeps an extremely close eye on our baby-sitting troubles . She ’ ll check on all our names , addresses , phone numbers , and birthdays on a regular basis , and make sure that any baby-sitting problems are dealt with after a meeting , while keeping a straight face when we ’ re not feeling so busy . ( The BSC only meets once a month . ) There ’ s another special thing about Kristy , that I ’ m the only Kristy associate . All of us members — even the two vice-president — make use of all these associate members ( not exactly the same thing , but I ’ ll bet there ’ s another reason for that ) . One of them is Claudia Kishi , who recently joined the BSC . She ’ s from an ordinary family , but she lives in a fashion statement . A real stylish guy . She and her family are so sophisticated that they really do look like the average middle-class family . One more thing : Claudia ’ s mom died in an automobile accident when the family was growing up . Kristy and Claudia have always been pretty close to her , but not quite as close as Kristy , who is thirty-one . ( Kristy was born and raised in New York City . ) Kristy ’ s family is extremely old-fashioned . In fact , Claudia and Kristy were the first of us to have their own clothes in all these years . ( Kristy did not want to go to Stoneybrook High School ; her parents , however , decided to
