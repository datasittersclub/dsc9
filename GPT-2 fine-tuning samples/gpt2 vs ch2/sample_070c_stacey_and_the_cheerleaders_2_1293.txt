California family , ” so she moved back to be with her dad and Jeff for a while . Dawn is also Mary Anne ’ s stepsister and best friend . Mary Anne ’ s been feeling pretty down since she left . ( So have I . Dawn is fun to be with — plus she ’ s the only other BSCer who doesn ’ t eat sweets . She ’ s a health-food freak . ) “ Have you talked to her lately ? ” Jessi asked . Mary Anne shook her head sadly . “ Not since two nights ago. ” “ We could call her now if you want , ” Claudia offered . Kristy looked at the clock . “ Nope . It ’ s two-thirty-four in California . She ’ s not back from school yet. ” She took a fistful of chips out of the bag . “ These aren ’ t bad. ” “ Kristy , don ’ t hog them , ” I said . “ Don ’ t worry , ” Claudia assured me . “ There ’ s another bag behind my hats. ” Translation : It was on the top shelf of her closet , where she keeps her huge hat collection . ( Probably next to a few Milky Ways and a box of Oreos . ) Claudia is the BSC vice-president . She also happens to be my best friend in the world . I love her so much . We have a lot in common , but I will never understand her eating habits . She loves candy , pretzels , and ice cream . Sometimes I think she ’ s the opposite of a diabetic — her body must need sugar and junk . Her parents don ’ t permit much junk food in the house , so Claudia hides candy , cookies , and chips all over her room . ( Mr. and Mrs. Kishi also permit only Great Literature , so Claudia has to hide her Nancy Drew mysteries . ) And here ’ s the weirdest thing . Despite her eating habits , Claudia looks like a model and has perfect skin . She has long , jet-black hair and dark almond-shaped eyes ( she ’ s Japanese-American ) . It ’ s easy for Claud to hide stuff , because her room is a mess . Not that she ’ s a slob . It ’ s just that every corner is taken up by art supplies . You see , Claudia is an artist . Talk about talent . There ’ s nothing she can ’ t do well — drawing , sculpture , painting , jewelry-making . Unfortunately , art has never been very important to the Kishi family . Grades and schoolwork are , and Claudia ’ s not a good student . For most of her life she felt inferior to her sister , Janine the Genius , who has enough IQ points for two people . But now even the Kishis realize Claudia ’ s got talent . One thing Claud and I do have in common is a passion for fashion . But our styles are different . I like sophisticated , chic clothes , and I ’ m great at spotting the perfect outfit in a catalog or shop window . Claudia ’ s more artistic . She dresses hip and funky ( hiply and funkily ? ) , and she puts together her own outfits . For instance , at the BSC meeting she was wearing baggy wool men ’ s pants , gathered at the waist by a black leather band ; a white tuxedo shirt with rolled-up sleeves ; Capezio-type flats with mismatched white and black socks ; and a glittery bow-tie barrette in her hair . On someone else , the Look might be too formal , or just plain weird . On Claudia , it was fabulous . As we sat there , passing around the second bag of chips , Shannon blurted out , “ Oh ! Guess what . My parents need a sitter for Tiffany and Maria on Tuesday afternoon . I have to go to this honor society meeting. ” “ Let ’ s see … ” Mary Anne looked in the club record book . “ I ’ m at the Prezziosos ’ , Kristy ’ s sitting for the Hobart kids , Stacey ’ s with Charlotte , Jessi has the Newton kids , Claudia has a dentist appointment … uh-oh. ” Kristy shook her head . “ I knew this would happen with two members missing. ” “ Logan adores the Hobart kids , ” Mary Anne said . “ If he doesn ’ t have track practice he might take your place , Kristy. ” She picked up the phone and tapped out his number . After a short conversation , she hung up and said , “ We ’ re in luck ! ” “ Good , ” Kristy replied . “ I ’ ll sit for the Kilbournes. ” “ Bring a suit of armor , ” Shannon remarked . “ You would not believe Tiffany . She has become such a brat. ” “ Really ? ” I said . “ She used to be so quiet. ” Shannon nodded . “ She missed the Terrible Twos . Instead she ’ s having the Terrible Tens . Even her teachers are complaining. ” Shannon and Logan , as I mentioned before , are our two associate members , and they ’ re not required to come to meetings . Shannon has hair to die for — blonde and curly and incredibly thick . She goes to a private school called Stoneybrook Day School , and she ’ s involved in a lot of extracurricular activities . Lately , though , she ’ s been picking up some of the slack for Dawn and Mallory . Logan ( who is cute with a capital Q ) is Mary Anne Spier ’ s
