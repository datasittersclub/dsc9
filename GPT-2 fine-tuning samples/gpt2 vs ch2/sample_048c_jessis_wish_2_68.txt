friends . ) It looks to me as if best friends have some things in common , but not everything . For instance , Mal and I are the same , yet different . Maybe that means that best friends need to have something in common but also need to find something in each other that ’ s foreign or unusual or unexpected . ( Opposites attract . ) I ’ m not sure , though . Friendship can be complicated . Take me . As I ’ ve said , I come from a pretty typical family — a mom , a dad , three kids , and an aunt . My passion is ballet . ( I take lessons at a special dance school , and I ’ ve even starred in some productions . ) I ’ m black . Now take Mallory . She comes from an eight-kid family , her passion is writing , and she ’ s white . We couldn ’ t be more different , right ? Wrong . Mal and I happen to have some common interests . We both love children and baby-sitting ( duh ) , and we adore reading , especially horse stories . Our favorite books are by Marguerite Henry . She wrote Misty of Chincoteague and Stormy , Misty ’ s Foal and Mustang , Wild Spirit of the West . Mal and I even read Brighty of the Grand Canyon , despite the fact that it ’ s about a mule , not a horse . We like mysteries , too . Not horror stories , but gentle mysteries like the Green Knowe books by L. M. Boston , or Tom ’ s Midnight Garden . Time-travel is always fascinating and mysterious . Uh-oh . I am way off the subject . Let me tell you some more about Mal , so you can see the ways in which we ’ re alike and different . Okay . I ’ ve said that she has seven brothers and sisters . They ’ re all younger than she is . And three of them are identical triplets . They are Byron , Jordan , and Adam , who are ten . Next comes nine-year-old Vanessa , then eight-year-old Nicky , then seven-year-old Margo , and finally five-year-old Claire . ( The Pikes have a pet hamster , just like we do , only their hamster is named Frodo , after the character in Lord of the Rings by J. R. R . Tolkien . ) When Mal isn ’ t watching her brothers and sisters or reading or baby-sitting or doing her homework , she ’ s writing and drawing . Mal would like to write books for children someday , and maybe illustrate the books , too . Mal feels insecure about her appearance . ( I don ’ t worry much about mine . I figure that as long as I have the body of a ballerina , I ’ m okay . ) But Mal thinks her nose is too big , her hair is too red , and she has too many freckles . On top of all that , Mal wears braces ( the clear kind , at least ) and glasses . Her parents refuse to let her get contacts . However , they did let her get her ears pierced — which prompted my parents to let me get mine pierced at the same time . Even so , Mal and I both think our parents treat us like infants ( another reason eleven is such an awful age ) . They won ’ t let us baby-sit at night unless we ’ re sitting at our own houses . They won ’ t let us dress as wildly as we ’ d like to . The Pikes won ’ t even let Mallory get a nose job . ( “ Just wait till I make my first million , ” says Mal . ) At any rate , as you can see , Mal and I are similar and different . So are Kristy Thomas and Mary Anne Spier . Kristy and Mary Anne grew up right next door to each other . ( Well , now neither of them lives in her old house , but they were next-door neighbors until the summer before they started eighth grade . That was when Kristy ’ s mom , who ’ d been divorced , got remarried . Kristy was the first of the two of them to move away . ) Kristy and Mary Anne actually look a little alike . They ’ re both short for their age , which is thirteen ( Kristy ’ s shorter ) , and they both have brown eyes and longish brown hair , which they often fix in ponytails . Neither one is a terribly trendy dresser . This is because Kristy couldn ’ t care less about clothes , while Mary Anne ’ s father can be strict about his daughter ’ s wardrobe . Here is what Kristy almost always wears : jeans , running shoes , a turtleneck shirt and a sweater , sometimes a T-shirt and a sweatshirt . She also has a baseball cap with a picture of a collie on it . Mary Anne ’ s father used to make her wear all this boring stuff , like plaid dresses , or corduroy jumpers with plain white blouses . Now he ’ s loosened up enough so that Mary Anne is allowed to buy her own clothes . But she ’ s not allowed to wear tight jeans , or shirts with a lot of glitter , or anything Mr. Spier thinks is “ too revealing. ” Needless to say , she has not been allowed to get her ears pierced . ( Kristy doesn ’ t have pierced ears , either , but only because she doesn ’ t want them . She thinks punching holes in her ears is gross . ) One thing that ’
