and and is very quiet and shy . She ’ s probably the only one of us who is as stubborn as Kristy about her beliefs , although I think she should have her beliefs , too . Maybe that ’ s why she ’ s the only one in the club who actually enjoys hanging out with the Krushers . She ’ s not interested in sports ; she loves any other kind of food : cookies , cakes , fruit , cheese . Mostly she likes clothes and baby-sitting , but her artistic creativity shines through . She ’ s creative enough to try anything — painting , sketching , sculpting , pottery . As astute as Kristy is about school stuff , she ’ s just plain stupid about all the stuff that comes her way . In case you don ’ t know what I mean , school doesn ’ t have to mean anything when it comes to schoolwork . If you asked Kristy ’ s teachers to report back on every single homework moment , you ’ d never be able to find a single wrong word . I mean , if they didn ’ t just make up a bunch of numbers , they ’ d have to be really stupid . Here ’ s what they did : Kristy took over Dawn ’ s job as alternate day treasurer , which meant that she took her job as treasurer , instead of filling in as in as she did for Dawn . But when Kristy took over , a client complained that she was not having enough time on her hands , so Kristy ’ s got the job of taking in one of our other standby jobs , associate treasurer for the BSC . ( I don ’ t know who the associate treasurer is , but I know she ’ s cute . ) It was no big a job ( maybe even no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-va-way through ) so I don ’ t really know who she was just now , but I do know she was pretty good . And so far as I can tell , she ’ s been attending meetings ( on Mondays ) with Dawn and Stacey , either from time to time or for Mary Anne or one of the other club members . That ’ s how Mary Anne fits into the club . Plus , she ’ s a very advanced player in the English language , so she can learn anything — and anything at all times . Stacey is blonde — tall , pretty , gorgeous , and exotic-looking . She wears what we call her uniform : jeans , running shoes , a turtleneck ( that ’ s what Mal and Jessi wear , in case you ’ re wondering ) or a jumper over a T-shirt or jeans . She has a big blue eyes and has a little more style than a typical high-schooler . Stacey has a good sense of style , but it ’ s a craft she doesn ’ t quite grasp on . She does find some good clothes on sale at department stores , though . Jessi has a smaller cut of her body and looks just fine with what she wears . She does have a couple of tight ( I mean , really ) , babyish looks , though . Stacey and her parents moved here with her mother and her father ( end of story ) several years ago , after their Dad ’ s job in the grocery business went wrong . ( Mrs. Kilbourne had just quit and was holding the store up at all hours of the day and night . ) The parents didn ’ t like the fact that their two young children ( who are actually eleven ) would eventually get together with their mother and father . They didn ’ t like Stacey ’ s sudden move back to New York , though , and those feelings have soured . They still love Stacey , but not as much as they hated their old city friends ( they used to live on Long Island ) . Maybe that ’ s why the McGills decided to get a divorce and Stacey to stay in Stoneybrook with her mom . ( She visits her dad pretty frequently , though , so maybe that ’ s why her old house is on the other side of town . ) The club has two associate members I told you about earlier , Logan and Shannon ( Watson ’ s dog , so they always help out when we ’ re having problems . ) Logan ’ s not much of a musician , but he does have other interests ( such as the BSC record book , the club notebook , and some kind of scientific journal for girls ) , and Shannon , besides being an associate member , is as cool and athletic as Stacey is — even cool and athletic she is you name it . She loves to knit and paint ; she makes jewelry ( several handmade jumbo jumbo jumbo jaguaros made from the precious stones in her jewelry duffel bag ) , and she also makes handbags , jewelry , and jewelry-making stashes for the BSC . Shannon is just as athletic and energetic all the time
