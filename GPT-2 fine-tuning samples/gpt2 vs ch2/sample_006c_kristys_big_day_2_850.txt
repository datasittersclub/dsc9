. It 's quite complicated , but for the time being , let 's just say that I do n't want Watson to feel obliged to finance four extra college educations . The money from the house , half of which , first of all , is your father 's , goes toward college for you and your brothers . So the more we make , the better . '' `` Mom , I 'm trying as hard as I can to follow all of this , but what exactly are you saying ? '' `` I 'm saying that Watson and I are going to have to get married at the end of the month so we can move into the Brewers ' house two weeks later . '' I was stunned . I stared at Mom with my mouth hanging open . David Michael came home , let Louie ( our collie ) in , sat down in Mom 's lap , and still I was openmouthed and speechless . The phone rang . Mom answered it . It was a friend of hers . They had a long , chatty conversation , which ended with Mom saying , `` So the upshot is that the wedding will be in two and a half weeks . '' `` Two and a half weeks , '' I moaned . `` What 's going on ? '' asked David Michael . `` It 's a long story , '' I told him . Mom hung up the phone . She seemed awfully calm—too calm . The next thing I knew , she was going crazy . She leaped to her feet ( David Michael jumped out of her lap just in time ) , held her hands to her head , and cried , `` Oh , my lord ! How can I plan a whole wedding in two and a half weeks ? Two and a half weeks ! Planning a wedding is like having a baby . You need time to prepare things ! You have to talk to the florist , the minister , the dressmaker , the caterer . You have to tell the relatives . You have to rent chairs ! I can just picture the caterer when I order crab crepes for three hundred . He 'll say , 'And what month is the wedding ? December ? ' and I 'll say , 'No , it 's this month , ' and he 'll laugh at me ! '' `` Mom— '' I started to say . David Michael tiptoed across the kitchen and held my hand . He stared at Mom , fascinated . Louie hid under the table . `` A tent ! We have to rent a tent ! '' she cried . `` Rent-a-tent , rent-a-tent , '' chanted David Michael , giggling . `` Mom— '' '' We 'll hold the wedding in Watson 's yard . We 'll never be able to rent a hall somewhere for the reception . What if it rains ? ! '' `` Mom— '' '' Oh , lord—decorations ! '' `` Mom , why do n't you call Watson ? '' I managed to say . `` I better call Watson , '' said Mom . ( She had n't heard me . ) Good . I hoped he could calm her down . Mom went into her bedroom and called Watson privately . When she returned , she looked saner . Sort of . But then she opened up a cabinet and began pulling pots and pans and things out of it . She seemed to be sorting them into piles . `` What are you doing ? '' I asked her . `` Not only do I have to plan a wedding , I have to get ready to move . This whole house needs to be packed up . We can take the opportunity to clean things out . I bet we have n't cleaned the house out in five years . We can make a big donation to Goodwill . '' David Michael began to whine . And even though I 'm too old to whine , I joined in . David Michael started with , `` But I do n't wan na move . I wan na stay he-ere . '' ( David Michael is a champion whiner . Anybody who can turn a one-syllable word into a two-syllable word is good—very good . ) I added , `` I want one more summer here . I do n't wan na leave yet . '' Mom pulled her head out of the cabinet . Very slowly she turned around to face us . She did n't say one word , just looked at David Michael and me . `` Uh-oh , '' said David Michael under his breath . He apologized quickly . `` Sorry , Mom . '' Then he hustled out of the kitchen with Louie at his heels . Mom was still looking at me . But I was n't about to apologize . I was sorry I 'd whined at her , but I was still upset about the move . `` You said we were n't moving until the fall , '' I told her . `` You said we 'd still be here this summer . '' `` Those were n't promises , Kristy , '' replied Mom . `` That 's simply what I thought was going to happen . '' `` But , Mom , no fair . I do n't want to spend this summer at Watson 's . '' `` You 'll be spending next summer at Watson 's , '' she pointed out . `` And the one after that and the one after that . '' `` I know . That 's why I want this summer here , with my friends . One last summer with Mary Anne and the Baby-sitters Club and Jamie Newton and the Pikes and—and in my own room ... '' I trailed
