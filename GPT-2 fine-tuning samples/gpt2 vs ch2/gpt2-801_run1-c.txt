red one in her own clothes with black suspenders . One thing that does tie up the club notebook is Claudia ’ s homework . Claud is fantastic at it . She does it in such a professional , original way . I like that . I try to do what I can to improve every day . We also have two sitters who are younger members of the club . They fill in when we have too many sitters . One of them is Jessi Ramsey , who lives in my new neighborhood . The other is Logan Bruno , who happens to be Mary Anne ’ s boyfriend , and he is wonderful . Jessi has curly golden hair and a flair for funny looks . She has two younger sisters , Claire and Andrew , so she likes clothing and makeup and all that junk . Jessi adores horse prints and the local kid-Kerr , and you can tell that she likes things like recycled baby-sitting materials , organic strawberries , and wildflowers . She also likes to think of herself as a ballerina , which is a classification system for performing arts arts arts ( academic ) , creative , in which the dancer is the student and the choreographer is the professional . According to Jessi , ballet is the one she wants to do as much dance as she can , and that it will probably be a big success simply by practicing her dancing . I bet she 'll do the trick just like David Michek does , and it ’ s as graceful as the way a football player catches the ball and tries to make a dive in the air while taking a release from his foot just before his jump press . Jessi ’ s family life is more complicated than Claud ’ s . Like Claud , her family lives in Stoneybrook , because Stacey ’ s dad remarried , leaving Jessi ‘ where ’ s-you-going-to-meet-the-new-born-at-the-right-time basis. ” Jessi ’ s mom grew up in New York City , which helps to explain why she is such a great ballet dancer . She moved to Stoneybrook when her dad was transferred back to New York City . And then , when her parents divorced , her mom went back to Stoneybrook to stay with her father . ( Her move left her with a combined household income of almost four times what she made in New York . ) So , at the beginning of seventh grade , her grandmother , Mimi , moved in with Jessi and her family . ( Before Mimi , there was only one Charlie Thomas , the other one Yodel , and the last one Arnold Schwarzenegger , and they lived in a mansion across town . ) There are two other members of the BSC , a girl named Dawn Schafer and one boy , a girl , a boy , and a girl , a dog , a cat , and a friend of the club called … my friend Stacey . Remember how I was telling you about Stacey ? Well , she was the treasurer of the BSC . That ’ s because she joined shortly after I went back to New York . She and Mary Anne Brewer , the president , hatched up around Mary Anne . Later when they were dating , they discovered that Mary Anne ’ s dad and Dawn ’ s mom had dated in high school . They got them fixed , and by the time they got married , they had a huge family . And the Thomases moved all the way back to New York , along with Dawn and her mom and two brothers . So now Stacey lives in the Big Apple . You see , our club was born out of this — the club we all came up with was Kristy ’ s , not Stacey ’ s , idea . Kristy thought the four main business functions would be business , club meetings , where the sitting kids could hang out , and club dues . Kristy thought that regular people would be busy : everybody can be club secretary ( except Mary Anne ’ s parents , whom they try to have sorted out ) . Dues are necessary , though . We hold our meetings on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays , from five-thirty to six . On Fridays , we close at five-thirty . Besides meeting for five hours out-of-the-way , paying dues , and being nice , Stacey has a special talent . She ’ s an artist . She paints , sculpts , sculpts . She makes jewelry and clay pottery . Her work takes shape almost like a work of art . She ’ s in the process of putting together the most fascinating clay sculptures ever put up . They ’ re so artistically created , they ’ re almost unbelievable . I ’ m so impressed with her sculptures that I ’ ve even given her a performance onstage at my school ’ s productions . * * * As anyone who has ever been in Stoneybrook knows knows , Kristy . She ’ s my best
