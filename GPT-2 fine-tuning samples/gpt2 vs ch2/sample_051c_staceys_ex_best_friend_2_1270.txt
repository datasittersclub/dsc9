and a big romantic . Also , she cries really easily . Just mention Gone With the Wind or Love Story , and Mary Anne ’ s eyes turn into leaky faucets . Maybe it ’ s fitting that Mary Anne was the first of us BSC members to have a steady boyfriend . Considering how different Mary Anne and Kristy are , it ’ s interesting that they actually look sort of alike . Mary Anne is also short ( not quite as short as Kristy , though ) , and has brown hair and brown eyes . However , she wears glasses for reading . And she cares about clothes . Her strictish father won ’ t let her wear anything too trendy , but at least Mary Anne can get away with bright colors , baggy tops , and a fair amount of jewelry . Mary Anne lives with her dad , her stepmother , and her stepsister . ( Her mom died a long time ago . ) Believe it or not , her stepsister is … Dawn Schafer , who happens to be Mary Anne ’ s other best friend . ( Mary Anne ’ s like me ; she has two best friends . ) Can you imagine being best friends and then winding up as stepsisters ? I can ’ t . Although , I guess I might have a stepsister of my own one day . Who knows what would happen if Mom or Dad got married again ? Anyway , Mary Anne , her dad , and her kitten , Tigger , moved into Dawn ’ s colonial farmhouse not long ago , and Mary Anne likes being part of a bigger family for the first time in her life . Okay . You ’ ve met several pairs of best friends . Now it ’ s time for you to meet my Stoneybrook best friend , Claudia Kishi . Claud is the BSC vice-president mainly because we hold our meetings in her room . This means invading her room three times a week , eating her junk food , and tying up her phone . Like Laine , Claud has her own phone and her own phone number . This is primarily why we chose her room as the BSC headquarters . We can use her phone during meetings and not have to worry that someone else is waiting ( impatiently ) to talk on it . Claud was born and raised here in Stoneybrook . She lives with her mom and dad and her older sister , Janine . She ’ s an incredibly talented artist . She can sculpt , draw , paint , even make jewelry . Unfortunately , she is not a wonderful student . She could be , if she wanted , since she ’ s smart . But school doesn ’ t interest her much . Claud has two addictions that she tries to keep secret from her parents : junk food and Nancy Drew mysteries . Her parents don ’ t approve of either , so Claud hides stuff all around her room . Lift up her pillow and there ’ s a Snickers bar . Look in the back of a desk drawer and there ’ s a bag of Fritos . Search through the mess on the floor of her closet and there ’ s The Clue of the Tapping Heels . Claud is such a character . I wish you could see Claudia Kishi . She ’ s absolutely beautiful . And exotic . She ’ s Japanese-American . Her hair is silky and black and long . And her eyes are dark and almond-shaped . She ’ s tall and thin and a very distant dresser . Claud cares about clothes as much as Kristy doesn ’ t care about them . That ’ s one thing Claud and I have in common . If I may say so , we are pretty sophisticated . We both like wild outfits — leggings , cowboy boots , short skirts , the layered look , cool hats . And we pay a lot of attention to our nails and our makeup and especially to our hair . I am constantly getting my hair permed . ( My hair is blonde and wavy ; the perm makes it look even wavier . ) Claud likes to experiment with different hairstyles . And she likes hair ornaments — beads and ponytail ties and flowers . You know what ’ s kind of funny ? Claudia and I are both a little boy-crazy . That ’ s safe to say . But neither of us has had a steady boyfriend . ( Sigh . ) While I ’ m on the subject of me , I ’ ll tell you about my role in the BSC . As treasurer , I ’ m the one who collects club dues from everybody at our Monday meetings . Since I like math , I ’ m good at keeping track of the money in our treasury . I dole out the funds as they ’ re needed , usually to buy supplies for the Kid-Kits , to pay Kristy ’ s brother Charlie to drive her to and from meetings now that she lives across town , and to help Claudia pay her phone bill . We decided to make Dawn our alternate officer . ( Well , Kristy thought of the idea , of course . ) The alternate officer is supposed to be able to take over for any member of the club who can ’ t make a meeting . This doesn ’ t happen often . ( I mean , we don ’ t miss meetings often . ) Even so , Dawn has to be familiar with the duties of the president , the vice-president , the secretary , and the treasurer . So far , she ’ s done a terrific job . Like me , Dawn was not born and raised in Stoneybrook
