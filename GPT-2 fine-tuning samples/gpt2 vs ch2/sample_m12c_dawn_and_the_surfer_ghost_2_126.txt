. When I arrived , the other members of the club were already there . Sunny had made a snack for the meeting , and everybody was digging in . I sat down next to Maggie Blume , one of the club members . `` Hi , Dawn , '' she said , passing me a bag of organic corn chips . `` Try the spinach dip — it 's great . '' `` It 's even better with the vegetables , '' said Jill Henderson , holding up a piece of raw broccoli dripping with green and white dip . Sunny passed me the platter of vegetables . `` Help yourself , '' she said . I took a piece of carrot and dunked it . This kind of snack is one of the reasons I like the We ♥ Kids Club . My friends and I like healthy , nutritious food — no Ring Dings for us ! During BSC meetings , I always felt a little out of it when I turned down Claudia 's offerings of junk food , but here I fit right in . Do n't get me wrong . It 's not as if everybody in California is a health-food nut . Plenty of people here think that big , greasy tacos or hamburgers with fries are perfect foods . But I was brought up on mostly healthy , organic food ( so were my friends here ) , and it just tastes better to me . Anyway , as I mentioned , Sunny started the We ♥ Kids Club after I told her about the BSC . The California club is modeled after the Connecticut club . They 're not identical , though — in fact , they 're not even close . The BSC is more like a business than a club . It has officers , for one thing . Kristy Thomas , the president , is the one who came up with the idea for it . She thought it would be great if parents could reach a bunch of sitters with one phone call , and she was right . The club meets three days a week : Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays from five-thirty until six . That 's when parents can call to line up sitters . The BSC has seven members — most of the time , that is . Lately the club has been changing a little . Kristy is a real go-getter . She 's the one who thinks up most of the ideas for the club . For example , the club record book , in which we keep track of our appointments . Also , the club note-book , in which we write up our baby-sitting experiences so the other club members can read them and stay informed about our clients . Kristy also invented Kid-Kits , which are boxes full of games , toys , and other things that kids love . They 're great for rainy-day sitting jobs . Kristy has brown hair and eyes , and she loves sports . She has a big family : her mom , two older brothers and one younger one , a stepfather , a stepbrother , a stepsister , an adopted baby sister , and a grandmother who lives with the family . Plus a dog , a cat , and two goldfish ! The vice-president of the BSC is Claudia Kishi . The club meets in her room and uses her private phone line . Claudia is Japanese-American , and she 's drop-dead gorgeous , with long black hair and almond-shaped eyes . As I 've told you , she loves junk food . She also loves Nancy Drew mysteries , shopping , boys , and art . Especially art . Claudia 's a very talented artist , and her creativity shows in the wild way she dresses . Unlike her older sister , who is a certified genius , Claudia is not such a great student . Her parents wish she would `` apply herself , '' but they are very understanding and supportive about her love for art . My best friend ( and sister ! ) Mary Anne is the secretary of the BSC . She keeps track of all our scheduling , and she does a great job . Mary Anne is shy , quiet , and sensitive . She has a boyfriend , and a kitten named Tigger . Her mom died when Mary Anne was a little girl , and her father ( who is now my stepfather ) was a very strict parent until recently . Fortunately , he 's loosened up a lot , and now Mary Anne is treated more like a teenager and less like a little girl . Mary Anne is not only my best friend , but Kristy 's , too . She and Kristy look a little alike , since Mary Anne also has brown eyes and hair , and is on the short side . But Mary Anne cut her hair in a cool new style recently , and now she looks trendier than Kristy . The treasurer of the BSC is Stacey McGill . She 's a whiz at math , so keeping track of our money is easy for her . She collects dues every Monday , which we use for things like paying Claudia 's phone bill and buying supplies for our Kid-Kits . Stacey grew up in New York City , and she 's pretty sophisticated . She has fluffy blonde hair which she perms , and she dresses very stylishly . Stacey 's parents got divorced not too long ago , and her dad still lives in New York . Fortunately for the BSC , Stacey chose to live in Stoneybrook with her mom . Stacey is a diabetic , which means that her body does n't process sugar correctly . She really has to watch what she eats ; in fact , she is the only other member of the BSC who turns
