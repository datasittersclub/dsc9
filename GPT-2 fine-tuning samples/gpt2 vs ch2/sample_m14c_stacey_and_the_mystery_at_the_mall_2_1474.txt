take over for any other officer who ca n't attend a meeting . We do n't need an alternate officer every day , but there are times when the job is essential . That 's why Shannon Kilbourne , who is usually an associate member like Logan , has temporarily replaced Dawn . Shannon , who has curly blonde hair and a ski-jump nose , lives in Kristy 's new neighborhood and goes to a private school . As one of our associate members , she used to be on call to take jobs when we had more than we could handle . Lately , though , she 's been acting as a full-fledged member , attending meetings regularly and taking on lots of sitting jobs . ( Logan attends meetings only when he wants to . ) Shannon has two little sisters , Tiffany and Maria . She 's a great student , and she 's always involved in after-school activities . That day she arrived soon after Mary Anne did . `` Whew ! '' she said , eyeing Claud 's digital clock . `` I just made it , did n't I ? I was at a drama club meeting , and my friend 's mom drove me here afterward . She is n't familiar with this neighborhood , and she kept making wrong turns even though I thought I was giving her good directions ! '' Kristy glanced at the clock . It was 5:28 , and I knew she was dying to start the meeting . But I also knew she would wait until exactly 5:30 , because that 's just the way Kristy is . She 's a strong believer in punctuality , to put it mildly . Claudia groped around under her bed and came up with a bag of Hershey 's Miniatures . `` I found these last night , '' she said . `` I hid them so well that at first I could n't remember where they were . '' Although Claud loves junk food , her parents do n't like her to eat it . So she hides it all over her room , along with the Nancy Drew books her parents do n't approve of ( they think she should be reading `` more challenging material '' ) , and pulls it out when we have meetings . She also keeps pretzels and whole-wheat crackers on hand for me . As vice-president of the club , that 's one of her only real duties , and it 's an unoffical one . Mostly she 's the vice-president because the club meets in her room â€” and we meet in her room because she 's the only BSC member with her own phone and a private line . Which reminds me of another one of her duties . Claud handles any BSC calls that come in when we 're not meeting . Kristy accepted the bag of candy and started picking out the Special Dark bars . While she poked around , Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike rushed into the room . Jessi and Mal are best friends , and the only junior officers of the club . They 're called junior officers because unlike the rest of us , who are thirteen and in the eighth grade , Mal and Jessi are eleven and in sixth . They ca n't baby-sit at night , except for their own families . Jessi has a younger sister named Becca and a little brother called Squirt . ( His real name is John Philip , Jr. ) . Mal comes from a huge family : She has seven younger brothers and sisters ! Three of them are identical triplets : Adam , Byron , and Jordan . Then there are Vanessa , Nicky , Margo , and Claire . It 's no wonder Mal 's such a good sitter . Jessi is African-American , with coal-dark eyes , cocoa-colored skin , and the long , limber body of a dancer . She studies ballet very seriously , and may be a ballerina someday . Mal has red hair , glasses , and braces . ( They 're the clear kind , and do n't really show , but she hates them anyway . ) Mal is a talented writer and artist , and hopes someday to write and illustrate children 's books . Jessi and Mal had arrived just in time . Right after they got settled on the floor , the clock clicked to 5:30 . `` Order ! '' said Kristy . The meeting had begun . `` Any new business ? '' she asked first . I kept quiet . It was a Friday , which meant I did n't have to collect dues . As treasurer of the club , I do that on Mondays . We all pitch in to help pay Claud 's phone bill and Kristy 's transportation costs . ( Her brother Charlie drives her to meetings . ) Nobody loves paying dues , but I have to admit that I like to collect them and keep track of all our money . Maybe someday I 'll invest some of it , and surprise everybody by making a killing on the stock market ! Or maybe not . Kristy would have a fit . When nobody answered Kristy , she plowed right ahead . `` Well , I have some new business , '' she said . `` Project Work is going to change the way we run the club for a while , from what I can tell . It 's a special class at SMS , '' she explained , turning to Shannon . Just then , the phone rang and Kristy answered it . It was Mrs. Perkins , one of our regular clients , looking for a sitter for Saturday . The BSC swung into business mode . Mary Anne checked the record book and told us who was free : Jessi , Mary Anne , and Claud . Claud said she had
