and her parents still live here . Of course , the move was difficult for Dawn and Jeff . They switched from a warm climate to a cold one ( cold in the winter , anyway ) , and they had to leave all their friends behind . Dawn adjusted to this pretty well , but Jeff never did , and after awhile , he moved back to California to live with Mr. Schafer . This is not an ideal situation , but it ’ s the way things are . Dawn and Jeff frequently fly across country to visit the other half of their family . I think one of the reasons Dawn adjusted to the move so well is because she ’ s an individualist . She ’ s independent and usually doesn ’ t care what people think about her . She eats what she wants ( health food ) and dresses the way she likes . ( My friends and I think of Dawn ’ s style as California casual . ) Dawn loves mysteries and reading ghost stories , so you can imagine that she was delighted to find that the old farmhouse her mother bought came complete with a secret passage . The passage leads from Dawn ’ s bedroom ( the entrance is concealed in the paneling ) to the barn on our property , and it was part of the Underground Railroad long , long ago . Guess what . The passage may even be haunted ! Here ’ s how Dawn and I got to be stepsisters . First we became friends ( right after Dawn moved to Connecticut ) , then we realized that my father and Dawn ’ s mother had gone to Stoneybrook High together , and then , by looking through their old yearbooks , we discovered that they had been in love . We found out that they wanted to get married , but Dawn ’ s grandparents didn ’ t think my dad was good enough for their daughter , so they sent Sharon off to college in California . That ’ s where Sharon met Mr. Schafer , and where they married and had Dawn and Jeff . Anyway , when Dawn and I realized that our parents had been in love , we were quick to get them back together . They had an on-again , off-again romance for awhile , but finally they got married . The rest is Schafer/Spier history . Claudia Kishi , another BSC member , is the one I spoke to on the phone when I felt as if I was wimping out with Logan . Although Claudia grew up with Kristy and me , she ’ s always been more mature than we have . She wears the trendiest clothes you can imagine , and she is so cool . A typical Claudia outfit might be black leggings , a baggy black-and-white shirtdress , low black shoes , and big wild earrings for her pierced ears . This outfit would be particularly striking on Claud because of her looks . She ’ s as gorgeous as Dawn , but in a different way . Claudia is Japanese-American . She ’ s got silky , jet-black hair ; dark , dark , almond-shaped eyes ; and this creamy complexion . The fact that her complexion is flawless comes as a great surprise to everyone , since Claud is the biggest junk-food nut we ’ ve ever known . If it tastes good and is bad for you , Claud likes it . Of course , her parents don ’ t approve of the habit , so Claudia has to hide her junk food . She ’ s got it stashed all over her bedroom — in drawers , under pillows , behind books on her shelves . It ’ s amazing . Poor Claud . She has another habit her parents don ’ t approve of — she reads Nancy Drew books . So she has to hide her books , too . The reason her parents don ’ t approve of Nancy Drew is that they feel Claud should be reading something more challenging . I think she should be allowed to read what she wants to read . If she didn ’ t read her mysteries , she wouldn ’ t read anything at all . Claud is not a great student . She ’ s smart , but she does poorly in school , especially in math , reading , and spelling . Her teachers say she doesn ’ t apply herself , but if I were Claud , I ’ d be just plain nervous about school . That ’ s because Claud has to follow in the footsteps of her older sister , Janine , who is a true genius . Janine is in high school , but she takes courses at the local community college . Plus , she is always winning awards for her schoolwork . Luckily , Claudia has one true talent . She is an artist . She can do just about anything — paint , sketch , sculpt , even make jewelry . She makes a lot of her own jewelry , and sometimes makes jewelry for other people . Claudia ’ s best friend is Stacey McGill . Like Dawn , Stacey is a newcomer to Stoneybrook . She and her parents moved here from New York City just before Stacey was to begin seventh grade . Stacey had grown up in New York ( she is so lucky ) and she ’ s as sophisticated as Claudia , which may be why they get along so well . Stacey also wears super-trendy clothes — layers on layers , hats , pins , cowboy boots , that sort of thing . Plus she ’ s allowed to have her blonde hair permed and she likes to wear nail polish , usually with sparkles in it . Stacey may seem glamorous , but her life has definitely not been that way .
