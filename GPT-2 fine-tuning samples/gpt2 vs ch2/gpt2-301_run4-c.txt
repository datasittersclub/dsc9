In the beginning we thought our clients would just drop dead on the spot and forget they loved us — which they probably do . But then we discovered that Mary Anne , our secretary , makes up such a big slob that none of us wants to see her . I was so mad . I ran out the door in her room , threw my books and my pencils ( but I did n't want to lose them ) , and tore my locker away . Luckily , she took her stuff back . And we have two new kids ( Andrew and Kristy 's mom ) , so some of us thought we should start thinking of ways to help them instead of just making Mary Anne sit . Our sixth-graders had their own way of organizing . They did n't talk about us in class , even though they knew that “ everybody ’ s friends are Mary Anne ” . All eight of them had come up with “ good ‘ s ” and they thought , `` Well , since Mary Anne lives in a mansion with a great teacher , maybe someday she ’ ll get married and step down as president of the United States of America . '' All eight of us are members of the Baby-sitters Club , and Kristy and I are the only club members who have a permanent job . That job pays Mary Anne to give herself up to caring more about schoolwork than her older sister , Janine . When Janine died , we needed a permanent replacement . We ended up hiring Mary Anne , who ’ d been helping out ( with a little help from Kristy and me ) , with a few other requests , like her ghost story . We decided to do this as a family tradition , or to pay dues and let Janine be a ghost . Then Janine did her thing in the club . She came to live with us , too — and with a little help . In fact , Mary Anne might have gotten an honorary doctorate if she had studied the ghost from a book and listened to her parents . It was Mary Anne — Mary Anne 's ghost — who brought our ghost story to life . We made her dinner last night . After dinner , Mary Anne and the rest of us went into the Kishis ’ s bedroom , listened to the radio , and read every word of the book . At that moment , Janine came running into the room to look at the books . ( She ’ d left the book behind . When the radio rang , everybody was sitting in the director ’ s chair to watch her . ) Then she took the book off the shelf next to her cupboard and picked up the book . “ The books will fit in the trunk of her car , just so , don ’ t you know , ” she said . “ They are in the trunk. ” So Janine pulled the book out of the car , opened the door , and began driving her younger sister home . Then , as I was writing this , I heard Kristy ask , “ How did you know the Kishis were all that long ago ? ” and Kristy started to cry again . “ Oh , they ’ d be dead last semester. ” Kristy looked very sorry . “ We were so used to them dying long ago. ” I was not exactly sure how they ’ d know . Kristy looked a little sad now . Mary Anne , Mary Anne , Janine and Mary Anne ’ s old group of friends , the Baby-sitters Club had never lived together . Then it dawned on them — and they finally realized that they needed each other . This is the BSC . We meet almost every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday , for baby-sitting and the kids . We meet at Claudia 's , where the club has two officers : Kristy , the vice-president of the club , and Mal , who is the youngest , if ever one . At the moment , Mal and Kristy are in the vice-president position , although not in the same place — in the director ’ s chair , in that little blue box with two holes in each end . Stacey is our secretary , which means that she has to be ready to take over the phone at all times . She is in charge of the club record book , and I think she knows how to keep us up-to-date on what ’ s happening with the Baby-sitters Club . Stacey also makes sure that when clients call to arrange for baby-sitting , she always gets them . We also record information about the kids in our club entries , so that parents know who ’ s available to baby-sit . Stacey has never , ever made a mistake . Now , I ’ m the secretary , since I became the club ’ s alternate officer seven years ago . But I have one more duty : to report to the president about every job we take . I do that whenever anyone is absent or on vacation
