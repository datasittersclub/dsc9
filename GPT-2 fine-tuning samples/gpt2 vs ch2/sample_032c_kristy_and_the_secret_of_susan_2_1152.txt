care much about it if she did know . Dawn has the longest , palest blonde hair I ’ ve ever seen . It ’ s the color of corn silk , and if it grows much longer , she ’ ll be able to sit on it . ( Well , maybe that ’ s an exaggeration . ) She has sparkly blue eyes , is tall and slender , has two holes pierced in each ear , and dresses in a style that my friends and I call California casual . “ Casual ” is a pretty good way to describe Dawn herself . She ’ s very laid-back . For the most part , she doesn ’ t care what people think of her and just sort of goes her own way . ( I ’ m hoping a little of that will rub off on Mary Anne . ) Dawn does have chinks in her armor , though . Every now and then , something will cut deep enough so that Dawn feels hurt or anxious . But not often . She ’ s easygoing , a caring stepsister to Mary Anne , and a good friend to the rest of us . As I mentioned before , Dawn grew up in California . Moving to the East Coast was hard for her . Not only did she leave her father behind , but she misses the warm weather . Dawn is happiest when July and August come to Stoneybrook . Maybe because of California ( or maybe not ) Dawn is also a health-food nut . So ’ s the rest of her family . They don ’ t eat meat or junk food , and they love vegetables , fruit , and gross stuff like tofu . Oops , I ’ ve gotten off the subject again . Anyway , Dawn , Jeff , and their mom moved to Stoneybrook — but Jeff , who ’ s nine or ten , was never happy here , so he finally moved back to California to live with his father . I know Dawn was terribly hurt then . Her family was split in half and separated by three thousand miles . But she ’ s happier now that she has another family . At first , everyone had some problems getting adjusted , but Mary Anne ’ s organized , finicky father turned out to be a good husband for Dawn ’ s disorganized , scatterbrained mother . And Dawn loves having a sister . She had always wanted one . Guess what one of Dawn ’ s favorite activities is — reading ghost stories . And guess where she lives — in a centuries-old farmhouse with an actual secret passage in it . This is the truth , although it ’ s hard to believe . The passage may even be haunted , but we ’ re not sure . Okay , on to Claudia . Claudia Kishi , the vice-president of the BSC , is as gorgeous as Dawn , even though the two of them don ’ t look a thing alike . Claud is Japanese-American . Both of her parents are Japanese , but Claud was born here in Stoneybrook . She has very long , silky , jet-black hair ; dark , almond-shaped eyes ; and a creamy complexion . Like Dawn , she ’ s got pierced ears , too , only she has one hole in one ear and two in the other . ( By the way , Mary Anne and I do not have pierced ears and intend to keep them like that — intact . ) Anyway , aside from being beautiful , Claudia is also an incredibly cool dresser and an incredibly talented artist . You should see her clothes . She ’ s always wearing short flared skirts , or leggings , or ankle socks and flat shoes , whatever is the most cool fashion at the moment . I don ’ t know how she knows what ’ s cool . Maybe she reads magazines or something . Claudia is also especially good at accessorizing . Again , she just knows how to do it . And she spends a lot of her baby-sitting money on the accessories — belts , jewelry , and tons of stuff for her hair — ribbons , bows , funky clips , beads . She wears her hair a million different ways . I ’ ve never seen anyone who can come up with so many styles . Claudia makes some of her own jewelry — ceramic earrings and pins , papier-mâché bracelets , that sort of thing . Claud can draw , paint , sculpt , make pottery , you name it . I ’ m glad she ’ s good at art because she ’ s terrible in school , although she ’ s smart . For some reason , school is just hard for Claud , and she doesn ’ t like it . She gets only average grades and she ’ s the world ’ s worst speller . Unfortunately , her sister , Janine , is a genius . She ’ s so smart that even though she ’ s a high-school student she gets to take courses at the local community college . For pleasure , Janine reads stuff like Atomic Theory or The History of Law-making in America . Claud reads Nancy Drew books , but her parents don ’ t approve of them , so she has to hide them in her room . Books aren ’ t the only thing she hides . Claudia is also a junk-food addict , something else her parents disapprove of . So there are bags of chips and candy , and packages of Twinkies and Oreos hidden in her room , too . Opening a drawer in Claud ’ s room , or going after something that ’ s rolled under her bed , can be a surprising experience . Claudia ’ s best friend
