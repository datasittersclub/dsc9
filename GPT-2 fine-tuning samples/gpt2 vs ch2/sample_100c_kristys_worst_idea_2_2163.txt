have … uh , a positive amount in the treasury. ” “ How positive ? ” I asked . “ Three dollars and seventeen cents , ” Stacey replied with a sheepish smile . That wasn ’ t what I ’ d expected to hear . “ Three dollars — ” I blurted out . “ Let ’ s celebrate ! ” Claudia exclaimed , jumping off her bed . She disappeared into the closet and returned with a tiny gumball machine in the shape of a dolphin . “ Is this cute or what ? ” “ Wait a minute , ” I began . “ We should have much more than — ” “ Unforeseen expenses , ” Abby quickly piped up . Claudia started tossing gumballs around the room . “ You drop it , you lose it. ” ( Honestly , they walk all over me sometimes . ) As Abby waited her turn , she clapped her hands and barked like a seal . The gumball smacked against one of her front teeth , and her seal imitation suddenly sounded like a wounded pup . Stacey waved Claudia off . “ No , thanks. ” “ Don ’ t worry , they ’ re sugarless , ” Claudia said . No , Stacey is not a weight-watcher . She ’ s diabetic . Her body doesn ’ t make this hormone called insulin ( which is sort of a valet parking service for sugar molecules : it stores them for a while , then lets them out over time into the bloodstream ) . Too much sugar , and Stacey could become seriously ill , and lose consciousness . But she ’ s able to lead a normal life with a strict , regular diet , and daily injections of insulin . ( I ’ ve seen her do it , and it ’ s not as gross as it sounds . ) What does a diabetic look like ? Well , if she ’ s anything like Stacey McGill , stunning . You could easily mistake her for sixteen . She has long , golden-blonde hair , and she dresses like a model . She says she picked up her fashion sense just by observing people in New York City , where she grew up . ( I don ’ t know who she observed , because whenever I go there I see a lot of people in jeans and T-shirts . ) Stacey still visits the Big Apple a lot . Her parents are divorced , and her dad lives in an apartment there . Stacey is our treasurer , mainly because she ’ s the only BSC member who actually likes math . She collects dues every Monday . Here ’ s what we do with the money , besides contributing to Claudia ’ s phone bill : We reimburse my brother Charlie for his gas expenses when he drives me and Abby to meetings . We buy supplies for Kid-Kits , which are boxes of toys and games we sometimes take to our jobs . We organize fund-raisers for our school and for charities . We put together field days and parties for our charges . And once in awhile we treat ourselves to a pizza party . As you can see , running a good club is not cheap . Which is why Stacey should never , never have let Abby mess around with the dues . Ahem . Okay , okay . Enough on that topic . It ’ s the last time I ’ ll bring it up . Promise . Back to the BSC . Our other regular members are Jessica Ramsey and Mallory Pike . We call them our junior officers because they ’ re eleven years old and in sixth grade . ( The rest of us are thirteen and in eighth . ) Their parents don ’ t allow them to take nighttime sitting jobs unless they ’ re taking care of their own siblings , but they take plenty of jobs in the afternoon . Jessi and Mal are absolute best friends . They ’ re both the oldest kid in their families , and they love to complain that their parents treat them like babies . They ’ re also major horse fanatics . Show them any Black Beauty or Saddle Club book ever written , and they ’ ll tell you the plot in more detail than you ’ ll want to know . They ’ re not total clones , though . Jessi ’ s African American and Mallory ’ s Caucasian . Jessi ’ s a phenomenal ballet dancer , and Mal likes to write and illustrate her own stories . Jessi has two younger siblings and Mal has seven , including ten-year-old triplet brothers ( if you can imagine such a horror ) . Our two associate members help us out when we ’ re super busy , but they aren ’ t required to attend meetings or pay dues . One of them is Mary Anne ’ s steady boyfriend , Logan Bruno . He ’ s kind of cute , if you like the dimply , dirty-blond , athletic type , and he speaks with a slight Kentucky accent . Our other associate is Shannon Kilbourne , who lives in my neighborhood and goes to a private school called Stoneybrook Day School . Shannon has curly blonde hair and a bubbly personality , and she ’ s a real joiner — honor society , drama club , chorus , Spanish club , you name it . Dawn Schafer is our honorary member . Now that she lives in California , though , she belongs to a different baby-sitting group called the We Kids Club ( a kind of sloppy , unprofessional imitation of the BSC — but they ’ re nice girls ) . “ Any other business ? ” I called out . Stacey nodded . “ My father bought me a ticket to a Broadway show for Friday
