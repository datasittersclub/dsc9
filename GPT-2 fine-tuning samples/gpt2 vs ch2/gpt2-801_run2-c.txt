to our friends . I don ’ t believe this , though . Kristy didn ’ t . Kristy is the president of the BSC . ( Her family 's consists of her three brothers and one sister , plus one younger stepbrother and one stepsister , plus one adopted African-American child , plus one baby brother and one grandmother . Not including the pets , this is a fairly full family . ) As I mentioned , Kristy ’ s a real hick , so she ’ s rarely a gazillionaire . She grew up in such a large family that she had to share a room with five people at once ! The idea for the club was Kristy ’ s very first job . Her idea ? Have a baby-sitting business . She told me one of her friends had suggested bringing a Baby-sitters Club to their meetings . That was when Kristy — who ’ d spent most of her life in Stoneybrook ( so did Dawn Schafer in seventh grade ) — came up with the idea for the Baby-sitters Club . Kristy ’ s great idea ? A club for parents to easily meet and line up baby-sitters . The BSC started with Kristy , me , Claudia Kishi , and my best friend , Mary Anne Spier . Claudia was the vice-president . As you might suspect from her name , Claud is usually on the thin of that and not very interested in sports . To Kristy , though , Claud is a pretty big personality . Our other vice-president is Stacey McGill . Because she ’ s not a baby-sitter , she takes charge of everything when our meetings are over . In fact , the other members of the club are the ones who aren ’ t baby-sitters . Mary Anne ’ s parents lived in Stoneybrook for so long that her bedroom was the scene of a crime ! How did the McGills escape from her house ? Friends say that they packed up and left Mrs. McGill ’ s old farmhouse into their driveway . ( That brings me to … the Junk Bucket Bites . ) We don ’ t know why they did it , though . Kristy doesn ’ t like to say things , but I think she did it because she missed her old house . One part of the house where the Junk Bites were not packed . My old cartographer ’ s chair . The closest thing Kristy had to a desk was a junk-store under her bedroom . I opened the drawer and found a small amount of money in it . I stopped the Junk Bites and realized I was practically in the treasury . I handed the money to Mary Anne and she returned it with a cheque for our expenses . Then I passed the money to me and we walked through the front door . I have to say that I was a pretty happy little kid . The rest of the members of the club were pretty different too . For one thing , there aren ’ t many members to fill in the room with . For another , we hate to have to deal with everyone yelling at one another after every baby-sitting we catch . We also had to deal with Kristy ’ s departure . She had made us the worst half of a single worst-case group ever . I don ’ t know what she had thought of us , but the whole thing was sort of like an iron fist . I mean , all the members were terrible . At first Kristy had us all in a big : mean , bossy , and divided ; and then she went overboard and started with the best guy in the whole world — in Stoneybrook ! But now I ’ m really getting behind her . She gets that club members and frets and makes them join her club . She ’ s also the best friend she gets , and the one who keeps her best friend together . Kristy grew up with two best friends . She was the first one to dress the way she did because that was what she had at a young age . Then , a couple of years later , she and her father divorced . Mrs. Thomas sent Kristy and her two younger brothers ( Kaz , who is now seven , and David Michael , who is now four ) to live with their mom in this tiny little house across the street from Claud ’ s . Mrs. Thomas had to raise all her kids by herself . Her house is , as I mentioned earlier , still a little on the thin side . But Kristy ’ s family has gotten better the longer she ’ s been a best-friend . Here ’ s what happened : Kristy ’ s mom almost certainly used to this father getting his head stuck in a chimney . She got it fixed right away and now it steps out at the top of every other book . Kristy has seven younger brothers and sisters . ( Two of them are triplets . ) And
