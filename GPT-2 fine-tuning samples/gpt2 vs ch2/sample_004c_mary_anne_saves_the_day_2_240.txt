, Mary Anne. ” He leaned over so I could kiss his cheek . “ Is dinner started ? ” “ Yes. ” ( Dad hates when people say yeah . He also hates shut up , hey , gross , stupid , and a long list of other words that creep into my vocabulary whenever I ’ m not around him . ) “ I ’ m heating up the pot roast. ” “ That ’ s fine , ” said Dad . “ Let ’ s just toss a salad . That will make a nice dinner. ” Dad and I got out lettuce , tomatoes , a cucumber , and some carrots . We chopped and tossed silently . In no time , a crisp salad was sitting in a glass bowl in the center of the kitchen table . My father took the pot roast out of the oven and served up two portions . We sat down and bowed our heads while Dad said grace . At the end , just before the “ Amen , ” he asked God to watch over Alma . ( Alma is my mother . ) He does that before every meal , as far as I know , and sometimes I think he overdoes things . After all , my mother has been dead for almost eleven years . I bless her at night before I go to sleep , and it seems to me that that ought to be enough . “ Well , how was your day , Mary Anne ? ” “ Fine , ” I replied . “ How did you do on your spelling test ? ” I took a bite of salad , even though I wasn ’ t a bit hungry . “ Fine . I got a ninety-nine . It was — ” “ Mary Anne , please don ’ t speak with your mouth full. ” I swallowed . “ I got a ninety-nine , ” I repeated . “ It was the highest grade in the class. ” “ That ’ s wonderful . I ’ m very proud of you . Your studying paid off. ” I nodded . “ Did you have a meeting of your club this afternoon ? ” he asked . “ Yeah … yes. ” Kristy , Claudia , and Stacey are all surprised that Dad allows me to be in the club and to do so much baby-sitting . What they don ’ t know is that the only reason he likes our business is that he thinks it teaches me responsibility and how to plan ahead , save money , and that sort of thing . “ What went on ? Anything special ? ” Dad attempted a smile . I shook my head . There was no way I was going to tell him about the fight we ’ d had . “ Well , ” said Dad , trying hard to make conversation , “ my case went … went very well today . Quite smoothly , really . I feel certain that we ’ re going to win. ” I shifted uncomfortably in my seat . I didn ’ t know what case he was talking about , but I had a feeling I should have known . He ’ d probably told me about it . “ That ’ s great , Dad. ” “ Yes . Thank you. ” We ate in silence for several minutes . “ This case is interesting because it demonstrates the extreme importance of honesty in business dealings , ” he said finally . “ Always remember that , Mary Anne . Be scrupulously honest and fair . It will serve you in good stead. ” “ All right , Dad. ” We ate in silence again , and it dawned on me that Dad and I sat across from each other at that table twice a day each weekday and three times a day on the weekends . If a meal averaged half an hour , that meant we spent over four hundred hours a year eating together , trying to make conversation — and we barely knew what to say to each other . He might as well have been a stranger I just happened to share food with sixteen times a week . I pushed my pot roast around my plate . “ You ’ re not eating , Mary Anne , ” my father said . “ Are you feeling all right ? ” “ Yes , fine. ” “ Are you sure ? You weren ’ t filling up on snacks at the Kishis ’ , were you ? ” “ No , Dad , I sw — I promise . I guess I ’ m just not very hungry. ” “ Well , try to eat your vegetables , at least . Then you may start your homework. ” Dad made starting my homework sound like some kind of reward . I forced down as much as I could manage . Then my father turned the radio on and listened to classical music while we cleaned up the kitchen . At last , I escaped to my bedroom . I sat down at my desk and opened my math book . A clean sheet of paper lay before me , along with two sharpened pencils and a pink eraser . But I couldn ’ t concentrate . Before I had made so much as a mark on the paper , I got up and flopped down on my bed . I remembered calling my friends : a conceited snob ; a stuck-up job-hog ; and the biggest , bossiest know-it-all in the world . I sincerely wished I hadn ’ t said those things . Then I remembered being called a baby and being told to shut up . I sincerely wished Stacey and Kristy hadn ’ t said those things . I wished I could talk to somebody . Maybe I could phone Claudia .
