the most popular person in the room at that time . I practically have to wrestle the money away from the other members , even though it ’ s not much . And then I have to make sure we have enough for the things we need ( such as payments to Kristy ’ s brother Charlie for driving her to meetings ) before we spend any money on luxuries ( such as pizza parties ) . One other thing we use treasury money for is to buy supplies for our Kid-Kits . What are Kid-Kits ? They ’ re another of Kristy ’ s great ideas . They are boxes full of games , toys , art supplies , and books that we can bring on jobs . Most of the stuff is just old hand-me-downs that we don ’ t use anymore , but the kids love to open those boxes and rummage through them . The club ’ s secretary is Mary Anne Spier , who happens to be Kristy ’ s best friend . As secretary , she keeps our club record book up-to-date with information on our clients . She also knows all our schedules , and can tell at a moment ’ s notice which of us is free for a job . Mary Anne is as shy and quiet as Kristy is bold , but for some reason they get along really well . Mary Anne has brown hair and eyes , just like Kristy , but she ’ s a little more fashion-conscious . In fact , she recently shocked the rest of us by having a makeover ! She got her hair cut in this really cute , short ’ do , and even bought new makeup and clothes . We needed awhile to get used to it , but now we think she looks great . I was surprised that Mary Anne ’ s father let her get a makeover , since he ’ s always been strict with her . He raised Mary Anne by himself ( her mom died when Mary Anne was just a baby ) and he kept his “ little girl ” in braids and jumpers for quite a while . But by now I guess he ’ s realized that Mary Anne isn ’ t his little girl anymore . She ’ s a teenager , and she wants to be treated like one . Mary Anne is the only member of our club with a steady boyfriend . That may seem odd , since she ’ s so shy and quiet . But Mary Anne is also very sensitive and caring , and very romantic , so I guess it makes sense that Logan ( that ’ s her boyfriend ’ s name : Logan Bruno ) is crazy about her . In any case , Mary Anne is likable , which also explains why she has not one , but two best friends . And guess what ? Her other best friend just happens to be her stepsister . Dawn Schafer , Mary Anne ’ s stepsister , is the club ’ s alternative officer . That means she can take over any job if one of the other officers can ’ t come to a meeting . Dawn has striking looks : long , long pale blonde hair , huge blue eyes , and a casual style of dressing all her own . Her skin just has this healthy glow , which probably is partly due to the fact that she ’ s a vegetarian and a health-food nut . She ’ s the only other person in the club , besides me , who turns down Claudia ’ s offers of Pringles and Devil Dogs . Instead , she ’ ll happily munch on an apple or some trail mix . Now , Dawn and Mary Anne weren ’ t always stepsisters . That happened pretty recently . Here ’ s how : Dawn grew up in California , but her mother had grown up in Stoneybrook . And when Dawn ’ s parents got a divorce , Mrs. Schafer decided to take her two children ( Dawn and her younger brother Jeff ) back to her hometown . Not long after Dawn arrived in Stoneybrook , she met Mary Anne and made friends with her and the other members of the club . She and Mary Anne quickly became best friends , and soon they discovered something very interesting about their parents . Back in ancient times , when Mary Anne ’ s dad and Dawn ’ s mom were in high school ( where they were known as Sharon and Richard ) , they used to date ! Mary Anne and Dawn helped their parents get re-acquainted , and eventually Sharon and Richard were an item again . Before long , they were married , and Mary Anne and her dad moved into the old ( and possibly haunted ) farmhouse that Dawn and her mom had been living in . By that time , Dawn ’ s younger brother had moved back to California to live with his dad . He just never adjusted to life in Connecticut . We ’ re sorry for Dawn , because she misses Jeff a lot , but we sure are glad she made the adjustment . There ’ s one more set of best friends in the BSC : Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike , our junior officers . We call them that because they are eleven and in the sixth grade and they ’ re not allowed to sit at night , except for their own families . They take a lot of afternoon jobs , though , which is great for them and frees the rest of us up for evening jobs . Jessi and Mallory have a lot in common . They both love to read , especially any book about horses . They both look forward to being older and treated less like children by their families . And they
