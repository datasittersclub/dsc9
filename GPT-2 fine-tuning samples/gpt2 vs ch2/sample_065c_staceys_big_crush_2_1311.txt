’ s an example . Not long after she started the BSC , she figured out a potential disadvantage of our club . Clients would not be guaranteed the same sitter each time . Parents would have to repeat instructions to each new sitter . Then the sitter and the kids would have to get acquainted from scratch . So Kristy dreamt up the BSC notebook . In it , we write down a summary of each job — special instructions , the kids ’ needs and preferences , funny stories , anything . Kristy insists that we write in the notebook after each job , even if nothing much has happened . That can be a bit of a pain . But all of us agree that the book is a huge help . Kristy also invented the BSC record book . That ’ s where we keep a schedule of our jobs , plus a client list — including addresses , phone numbers , the rates they pay , and their kids ’ names and ages . Another brilliant Kristy idea was Kid-Kits . They ’ re just cardboard boxes filled with simple toys , games , and books — mostly art supplies and stuff we scrounge from our houses . What kid would want to play with old junk like that ? You ’ d be surprised . Our charges adore Kid-Kits . Then there ’ s Kristy ’ s Krushers , a softball team she organized for kids who weren ’ t ready for Little League . Kristy , by the way , is great at sports . She ’ s small and compact , and she usually wears sweats or jeans and a T-shirt or a turtleneck . She never wears makeup , though , and doesn ’ t do much with her long brown hair . Kristy is so down-to-earth , you ’ d never guess her stepdad was the richest man in Stoneybrook . Well , maybe that ’ s an exaggeration , but he ’ s definitely well-off . Which is great , because most of Kristy ’ s life hasn ’ t been so privileged . She used to live in a small house across the street from Claudia ’ s . Not long after David Michael was born , about seven years ago , Kristy ’ s dad just left the family . No explanation , no nothing . He hardly ever calls his kids , so he ’ s persona non grata around here . ( My mom uses that expression . It means “ person not wanted. ” ) Mrs. Thomas held down a job and raised Kristy and her three brothers by herself . Then one day she fell in love with Watson Brewer . He ’ s a really sweet guy , very quiet , and a terrific gardener . Well , he and Mrs. Thomas got married and the Thomases moved in with the Brewers ( Watson has two kids from his previous marriage , who live in his house on alternate weekends and holidays ) . The family has grown to include Emily Michelle , an adopted Vietnamese girl , and Kristy ’ s grandmother , Nannie . And they have all kinds of pets . So the Brewer house is a pretty busy place , but there ’ s lots of room . It ’ s an enormous old mansion , way on the other side of town . Kristy has to be driven to and from BSC meetings ( usually by her oldest brother Charlie ) . “ Hrr-rmm , hrr-rrmm. ” Kristy cleared her throat . Claudia ’ s digital clock read 5:29 . I was sitting in my usual position , cross-legged on the bed , sandwiched between Mary Anne and Claudia . Jessi and Mal were on the floor . Dawn was sitting backward on Claudia ’ s desk chair . Kristy was perched on a canvas director ’ s chair , wearing her trusty visor . As always , she had one eye on the clock . The moment it hit 5:30 , she blurted out , “ This meeting will come to order ! ” We all sat up a little straighter , waiting for Kristy ’ s next line ( which is “ Any new business ? ” ) . “ Any new business ? ” ( See , she never lets us down . ) “ Dues day ! ” I said . I am the club treasurer , the one who has to take a share of everyone ’ s hard-earned money on Mondays . We use the money to pay Charlie Thomas for his gas expenses , to help Claudia with her phone bill , and to buy new things for Kid-Kits . If any money is left over , we sometimes plan a pizza party or something . My position , of course , is the most beloved of all . You can tell from the reactions : “ Already ? ” “ Do we have to ? ” “ Ugggh , that ’ s right … ” “ Can ’ t we skip this week ? ” I did my duty and collected the money . ( The grumbling is sort of a tradition . My friends don ’ t really mean what they say . At least I hope they don ’ t . ) No sooner did the last coin jingle into our treasury ( an old manila envelope ) then the phone rang . “ Baby-sitters Club , ” Claudia said into the receiver . “ Oh , hi , Mrs. Barrett … . Next Tuesday ? Oh … okay , I ’ ll check and call you right back… . ’ Bye. ” She hung up and turned to Mary Anne . “ The Barrett kids , two weeks from tomorrow ? ” “ Um , let me check , ” Mary Anne said . Mary Anne is our secretary . She handles the record book . Talk about a complicated
