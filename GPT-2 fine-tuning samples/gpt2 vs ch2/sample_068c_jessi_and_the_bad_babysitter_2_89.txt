I told her I couldn ’ t talk until the meeting started. ” “ Wow ! ” I said . “ The phone has started ringing already ? ” With a loud crinkle , Claudia ’ s potato chip bag split open . She offered the chips to Kristy and me . “ I guess summer is really over , ” she commented . “ Everyone is back to PTA meetings and working overtime and being busy. ” Cradling a handful of potato chips , I settled onto the floor in my usual spot . “ Were you guys so busy this time last year ? ” I asked . Kristy pushed back the brim of her baseball cap and leaned forward in Claudia ’ s director ’ s chair . ( That ’ s Kristy ’ s usual spot . ) “ No , but our business has grown a lot . We ’ re really well known now. ” The fact that the Baby-sitters Club is such a big success is largely due to Kristy . For one thing , she thought of the club . The idea came to her one afternoon when she was in the seventh grade . Her mother needed a baby-sitter for her younger brother David Michael . Kristy and her two older brothers , Sam and Charlie , were busy , so they couldn ’ t sit . ( Kristy ’ s father wasn ’ t around . He walked out on the family not long after David Michael was born . ) So Mrs. Thomas was going crazy as she called a zillion numbers trying to find an available baby-sitter . That ’ s when Kristy was struck with her great idea . What if her mother could call only one number and get in touch with a whole bunch of sitters ? That would be so convenient . Parents would love it ! Kristy told her idea to her best friend Mary Anne Spier and they decided to form the Baby-sitters Club . Claudia joined them , which was great . Not only is Claudia a terrific baby-sitter and a fun person , she also has her own telephone and her own telephone number . That made it possible for people to call the BSC without tying up the main family telephone . Kristy , Mary Anne , and Claudia weren ’ t sure they had found enough members for a club , though , so they invited Stacey McGill to join . The four of them handed out fliers and put up signs advertising their new service . Parents wanting a baby-sitter could call Claudia ’ s number between five-thirty and six every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday and reach four capable sitters at once . The business was an instant success ! Then Mary Anne became friends with Dawn Schafer and she joined . Mallory and I joined next . Kristy didn ’ t stop with one great idea . They just kept coming . She was the one who thought of the BSC record book , which keeps all our appointments straight , and she thought of the BSC notebook , which is full of information , advice , and entries about our sitting clients . ( It ’ s very helpful if you ’ re going into a new job to know a little about the kids in advance . ) Kristy also thought up Kid-Kits , which are boxes filled with small toys , crayons , coloring books , and other odds and ends kids might like . They are a real hit with the kids we sit for ( all kids like to play with new stuff ) and make us very popular baby-sitters . If I were to list all Kristy ’ s great ideas , the list would take up pages . She ’ s a real dynamo . That ’ s why she ’ s the club president . The funny thing is , Kristy doesn ’ t look dynamic . She ’ s petite with shoulder-length brown hair and brown eyes . Most of the time she dresses in jeans and a sweatshirt . ( She couldn ’ t care less about fashion . ) However , nothing about Kristy is average . You ’ d know it within minutes of meeting her . Your first clue would be her big mouth . Kristy is very direct . ( Some might even call her loud and bossy . ) Kristy knows this about herself , but she doesn ’ t care . That ’ s how she is — take her or leave her — which is one of the things I admire about her . One thing you ’ d never guess when you first meet Kristy is that she ’ s rich . Her stepdad Watson is a millionaire ! Her mom married Watson not long ago and Kristy ’ s life changed in a big way ! For starters , she moved across town to live in Watson ’ s mansion . Now her brother Charlie has to drive her to club meetings . Her family also grew . She became an instant big sister to Watson ’ s son and daughter from his first marriage , Andrew and Karen . ( Although they are only at Kristy ’ s house on weekends , some holidays , and part of the summer , Kristy has grown very close to them . ) Then her mom and Watson adopted a Vietnamese girl named Emily Michelle who is now two and a half . And last but not least , Kristy ’ s grandmother came to live with them to help take care of Emily Michelle . Add a dog , a cat , and two goldfish to the list and you have one big household . Come to think of it , it ’ s a good thing they do live in a mansion ! Kristy checked Claudia ’ s digital alarm clock . It said 5:27 . “ Where is
