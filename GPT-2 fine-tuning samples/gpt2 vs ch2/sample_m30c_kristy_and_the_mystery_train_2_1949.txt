Claudia is very trendy , too . But as with our other best-friend pairs , Stacey and Claud have plenty of differences . Claudia 's look is less New York elegant and more funky-artistic . That 's because Claudia is an artist . Unlike Stacey , who is good at all subjects , not just math , Claudia thinks school is basic torture and she does n't do well in it at all . What she does excel in is art . She 's already won prizes for her work , and she plans to be a professional artist someday . Claudia 's artistic eye shows in the ways she combines colors and shapes in her clothes . Today she was in bright mode : red shorts , a purple crop top over a longer red-and-white-striped muscle shirt , purple socks , and red high-tops laced with red-and-white-striped shoelaces . Her hair was pulled up to one side with a knot of red and purple scrunchies , and her earrings were shiny red apples . Not everyone could have looked good in that . But Claudia , with her long black hair , perfect creamy skin , and dark almond-shaped eyes ( she 's Japanese-American ) , looked terrific . One more difference between Stacey and Claudia : Claudia is a junk-food gourmet . She keeps all kinds of bad goodies hidden strategically around her room , where her parents ca n't find them ( they do n't want her to eat junk food , and they do n't want her to read Nancy Drew books for some reason , so she hides those , too ) . Claudia always shares her hidden treats with us at BSC meetings , along with pretzels and popcorn and other healthier snacks for Stacey . Two other best friends in the BSC are Mallory and Jessi . As junior officers , they concentrate on daytime sitting jobs . That 's because they are both eleven and in sixth grade , so they are n't allowed to sit at night yet , except for their own brothers and sisters . Mallory has had plenty of baby-sitting experience . The oldest of eight children , she has four brothers ( including Nicky ) , three of whom are identical triplets , and three sisters ( including Claire ) . Like all of her sisters and brothers , Mallory has pale skin , blue eyes , and hair in the chestnut brown range , although in Mal 's case it is more of a reddish brown . To her eternal despair she wears glasses and braces . She wants to lose the braces ( but her parents and her dentist wo n't let her ) and is saving her money for contact lenses . She likes to write and draw and wants to be a children 's book author and illustrator someday . And she loves horses and horse stories , interests she shares with Jessi . Jessi and Mal have other things in common , too : Like Mal , Jessi is the oldest kid in her family . And both girls have pet hamsters . But Jessi is from a smaller family . She has one younger sister , Becca , and one baby brother , John Philip , Jr. ( nicknamed Squirt ) , plus her mother , father , and her aunt Cecelia ( who helps take care of the family ) . And Jessi 's ambition is to be a professional ballerina . She takes special dance classes after school in Stamford , gets up every morning at 5:29 exactly to practice on the barre set up in her basement , and has already danced important roles in several ballets . Although Jessi was dressed as casually as all of us except Claudia and Stacey , her clothes definitely gave away clues about her interest in ballet . She was wearing an old , faded pink leotard that made her brown skin and brown eyes glow , and her black hair was pulled back into a dancer 's bun . She carries herself like a dancer , too â€” very gracefully and with perfect posture . Our newest member , Abby , is not yet close to anyone in particular , although , of course , we are all friends . She and her mother and twin sister , Anna , moved here after Mrs. Stevenson earned a big promotion at her job in New York City . Abby 's father was killed in a car wreck a few years ago . She hardly ever talks about him . But do n't make the mistake of thinking Abby is quiet or shy . The opposite is true . She is very opinionated . I noticed this right away , when she started challenging everything I said . Okay , maybe she did n't challenge everything , but the point is , Abby is not shy about sharing her thoughts . I do n't always agree with her , and she and I do n't always get along . But I respect Abby , and I like her . And we do have some things in common . For example , we are both sports fans , big time . I can watch any game , anytime , anywhere . And I like to play softball so much that I tried out for , and made , the SMS girls ' softball team . If it 's possible , Abby is even more athletic than I am , hard as that is to admit . She is a little taller than I am , with brown hair and brown eyes . Sometimes she wears glasses and sometimes she wears contacts , depending on her mood . She 's a soccer fanatic who can tell you the names of every single player on the U.S. women 's soccer team . Plus , she 's a player . She was captain of her team back on Long Island , and she joins every pickup game she sees .
