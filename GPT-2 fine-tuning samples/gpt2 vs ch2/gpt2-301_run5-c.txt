That ’ s so cool , right ? ) We meet here every other Monday at 5:30 , and we get along great , I suppose . Dawn and me are on a separate plane because we don ’ t meet on Mondays anymore . ( Well , not Mondays anymore . It 's on the regular time schedule the Astronomy Club has with us . ) But that ’ s okay , isn ’ t it ? We ’ re not worried anymore . So , if you ever wanted to be a baby again , Dawn ’ s here as well . The kids we sit for are : Dawn , Kristy , Mary Anne , and Claudia ; Jessi , Margo , and me ( my sister , to tell you why I ’ m starting the Baby-sitters Club ) ; and a few new friends , like Dawn . And all of the rest , except for our oldest brother John . We ’ re all very much in touch with him , and he is the closest thing we ’ ve got to an actual brother . It takes a special person to be able to sit for a little kid , or for two people to be best friends . Let ’ s talk a little about David Michael . I mean , I ’ m glad we ’ re brothers , because David Michael is the greatest . What a person . He ’ s so cool . He can ’ t wait to be a baby , baby , baby . He ’ ll be very cute ( he ’ s African-American , with reddish-brown hair and freckles , and blue eyes that make you think of him ) , but I didn ’ t know David Michael until I was so young . David Michael is like me . At six years old , he has a smiley-face and , most of the time , a goofy sense of humor . That just goes for him . He ’ s also the oldest kid I know , so I guess it ’ s natural for me to be older . He even looks like I ’ m the oldest kid in my family ( Jessi , Stacey , Margo , Thomas , and Vanessa ) . What kind of parents would we be ? Well , not really , but we ’ ll have to agree . I bet our kids would want to be like us . We ’ ve been together since we were nine , after all . Okay , I ’ ve told you pretty much , but I ’ m going to be very precise . I ’ m going to tell you how we got married . Before we did , we ’ d been parents . It started out kind of as this simple idea in our house . As Kristy Thomas , who was our president , started making up rules for us , we thought , how come we had to form a club called the Baby-sitters Club . Then Mary Anne Spier joined it , and everyone else joined the club . We used the money from our house for dues , but we didn ’ t use it to pay our phone bill or to take care of any of the other kids ’ other responsibilities , so those weren ’ t the only expenses . Okay , so we thought about it for a little longer . We were so busy with other things , like Kristy ’ s new movie , that we had to come up with the idea for Kid-Kits . The Kid-Kits are , like , boxes of toys — toys — but with lots of fun-things in them . One of our other friends , Dawn Schafer , gave the idea to me , and I was so impressed with her that I picked up the Kids “ Baby-sitting devices ” and went straight to work ( okay , only my first job , but I guess that was after Mr. and Mrs. Schafer had been around long enough to know how to do things ) . At that point , Kristy decided to move away from the group , away from Dawn , to go to her father ’ s , where she was much more normal . I still remember a little bit , like when she gave her mom a big hug and said , “ Mom , Mom ! ” Maybe that ’ s why I had so much fun with them , the way they handled us . The other good thing about Dawn was that she ’ d befriend Dawn ’ s stepmother , Janine . Now the other girls , including Mallory ’ s twin sister , Vanessa ( who ’ s eight ! ) , are very adopted . I feel like I ’ m being romantic , but we always have best friends . Anyway , I finally convinced Dawn to return to Stoneybrook , which was all the more amazing because now we live in a gigantic mansion . You can see how romantic Dawn ’ s life is . She has two older brothers , Charlie and Sam , who live there from age nine to seventeen . They are so overprotective of their younger brother
