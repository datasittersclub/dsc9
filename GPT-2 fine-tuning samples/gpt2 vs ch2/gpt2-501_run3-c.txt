that we are all friends , and we have a lot in common . We like to read , we like to sew , and we like to complain about our schoolwork . We also do a good job of it ( mostly ) , and we hardly ever make our own phone bills . Kristy is from a big family . And she has two other kids , Jordan ( 6 ) , and Karen , who are eleven and younger . ( Karen , by the way , is the sister of one of my friends , who has an identical twin , so her family is n't that complicated . ) Jessi and Mallory are junior officers in the BSC , which means those kids hardly ever go on night jobs . Instead , they take afternoon jobs , or sitting jobs that come in handy if the kids are sick . ( I know they do . ) I 've been secretary of the BSC for a few years now , but then neither of our junior members thought much of starting a baby-sitting business . One day , Kristy hears from an idea . She asks for help recruiting baby-sitters , says that she 'd like to set up a club , and so on . The idea worked like a charm , though . Suddenly parents were interested in being able to meet at their houses to arrange for sitters . And we had plenty of business . By the spring of seventh grade , when Claudia 's mom was married again , we ran a successful business with one phone call and one steady job . That 's how the club came to be . Here are some other changes in Kristy : Mallory , who is an eight-year-old , can take on several jobs at once . Mal has shorter day jobs and has two younger siblings ! Not everybody would like to have her on the job , but Mal said she would , if she could . Now our regular clients include Logan ( Logan is our boy ’ s coach ) , Sharon ( our resident orthodontist ) , Kristy ( her favorite animal ) , Kristy ’ s seven-year-old stepfather , David Michael , Mary Anne and their three brothers , Charlie and David , plus Karen , Andrew , and Derek , and Shannon , who is just one kid . Kristy is president of our club because she is a real leader . And she ’ s got her own ideas , too — things like the fund-raising drives , the trips we make to New York ( the BSC was her idea ) , the trips we take to Paris , and other things . She also has a big heart , and she cares a lot about what people think , so she has to give special attention to things like health concerns , and to the club notebook , in which each member is responsible for writing about every sitting job they go on . We also use those notebooks to write up jobs , because we ’ re a big club and everyone comes to meetings regularly ( even Kristy ’ s friends boast about having to pay dues every week ) . Since it ’ s such a gigantic business with so many kids , we ’ re always in good shape . But then things get pretty crowded out . That means we have to be organized . Kristy always seems to have it organized fairly well . In her mind , it ’ s a club . Kristy ’ s thinking is just as wild . For example , in the notebook she wrote about the Papadakises . It was a love letter to Kristy ’ s great idea of strict vegetarianism . And guess who also wrote about it ? The New York Post . Luckily Kristy grew up with an older sister , whom she ’ s known since she was a little kid . And one day her younger sister , Emily Michelle , moved back to Stoneybrook . And Kristy ’ s mom and brothers soon got together and found that all those old friends hadn ’ t died down , but had been strained by their daughter trying to do too much at the same time . That left Kristy ’ s mom to handle the situation herself , and with her two younger brothers , Charlie and Sam , dealing with toddler-puppiness , she was lucky . And when the divorce was announced , she announced it then . So now that you ’ re over there , that means you ’ ve met Kristy , you can imagine how she handles stuff . But if you thought Kristy was a baby-sitter , a whiny , loudmouth who couldn ’ t listen to people ’ s opinions , think again . Now if you ’ re wondering what all that stuff is like , well it ’ s nothing . Kristy ’ s family split up and she didn ’ t have an adopted Vietnamese girl in tow . ( That ’ s right , Mary Anne ’ s dad raised two kids here in Stoneybrook , so Kristy ’ s mom grew up with three kids in tow . ) And right now , she has two stepfamilies and one boy only
