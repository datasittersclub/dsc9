, who is the most disgusting boy in our class . I once poured Yoo-Hoo down his shirt in fifth grade . He was lucky that 's all I did . As I glanced absently around the room that Monday morning , considering other candidates for a class in manners , my gaze fell on Cary Retlin . Not all of the above rude dudes are in my class , but Cary was definitely present , front and center and looking not one bit like a Mischief Knight . He actually appeared to be paying attention . Ha , I thought . Then I felt the teacher 's eyes on me and tried to look as interested as Cary . As a matter of fact , I do like social studies . We just happened to be studying a sort of boring part . I was n't called on , but I concentrated on paying attention anyway . Paying attention in class , even during the boring parts , saves time when it comes to studying for tests later . The things teachers like to talk about are the things that usually show up on tests . At least , that 's my theory . At last the bell rang . I slapped my book shut and shoved it into my pack . Math next . My backpack has lots of compartments , and I have a system for it . I put my homework in one of the outside compartments , my notebooks in order in another , and then add my books to a third compartment as I need them during the day . I 'd gotten my math book from my locker before social studies . So all I had to do was pull out my math homework and ... And ... And where was my math homework ? I riffled through the pages in the outside `` homework '' compartment . I did n't see it among the other homework assignments . But I was sure I had put it there , and I was almost dead certain it had been on top when I 'd zipped that section up . I was about to panic when I spotted something crumpled at the very back of the homework compartment . I pulled it out . Crumpled . Not neat . But definitely my math homework assignment . I let out a sigh of relief and began to smooth it out on my desk . I froze , my hands flat on the paper . There were the questions , all right . But where were the answers ? The ones I had written in so carefully the night before ? Gone . Every single one . I jerked the paper up and held it close to my eyes in disbelief . I could see the faint pencil smudges where the answers had been . Someone had erased them . But who ? And how ? The `` who '' answered itself . In the lower right-hand corner , in red pencil , were the letters `` MK . '' The mark of the Mischief Knights . My head snapped up just as Cary lowered his to zip his own pack and slide quickly out of his seat . He almost made it to the door . But I caught him . `` You did this , did n't you ? '' I demanded , stepping in front of him . A couple of people looked at us curiously , but they kept going . Cary looked down at the paper I was holding , then up at me . `` You erased the answers on my math homework , did n't you ? '' Cary smiled . He did n't answer . `` You think it 's funny ? It 's not funny , Cary , '' I said sharply . `` It 's low . Despicable . '' Cary arched one eyebrow . `` But why am I surprised ? '' I asked . `` After all , you and your Mischief Knights are the ones who are always interfering in our BSC investigations . The only mystery is , that you have n't realized that nobody 's impressed . '' `` Investigations , '' said Cary , rolling the word off his tongue mockingly . `` Oooh . Do you make citizens ' arrests , too ? '' `` We solve mysteries , '' I snapped , `` which is more than you 've ever done . '' `` Really ? '' said Cary , arching his eyebrow again . `` Is there something wrong with your eyebrow ? '' I asked , pretending I 'd just noticed . `` Do you have a twitch or something ? '' That got to him . He lowered his eyebrow and his cheeks reddened slightly . He said , `` The Mischief Knights — whoever they may be — could probably solve any mystery they wanted to long before the BSC even had a clue . Personally , I know I could solve any mystery before you could say 'Sherlock Holmes . ' `` '' Ha , '' I said . `` Well then , '' answered Cary , barely skipping a beat . `` I hereby challenge you to a mystery . '' That stopped me . I looked at Cary suspiciously . `` Is this some kind of a joke ? '' `` Nope . '' Cary shook his head , keeping his eyebrow lowered . `` This is the deal . I create a mystery . You and the baby-sitter detective squad solve it . '' `` What 's in it for me ? For the club ? '' `` I back off . No more jokes . No more , um , mischief . '' Cary grinned . `` From me , anyway . '' I wanted to punch him . But I remained nonviolent , considering the idea . I decided it was n't a joke . I decided that it was worth it .
