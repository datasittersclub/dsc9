for our next meeting of the Baby-sitters Club ! There , all too late , Dawn was already seated on Claudia ’ s knee at our table . “ Dawn ! ” she cried . “ How did you know that a little girl needed a ride home ? ” “ Great , ” Claudia answered . “ I can sit on the couch and watch a little girl grow up . And you can sit on the couch and watch her grow up. ” “ Well , it ’ s good to hear the BSC back at the end of the week , ” Mallory said . “ I really like it . You know how it used to be on the BSC ? ” Before I could speak too much more , the clock on Claudia ’ s bed switched from 5:29 for the meeting to 5:30 . “ Here we are ! See how excited we are about playing baby-sitting again ! ” Claudia was singing in the background . “ Here we are ! We got so many business ! ” We were almost out of money . We raised the money to buy the Barrett ad and then put up fliers in local newspapers . We were so happy . Suddenly , we needed more money . In fact , the next day , we raised more than we could afford . And now we ’ ve made enough to buy a whole gym . It would be fun , too . “ We are meeting again this week , ” Claudia announced as she sat on the front stoop of Kristy ’ s bed . “ We can still think on a new idea , ” Mallory volunteered . “ Yeah . What ? ” Kristy asked . “ We ’ d better start thinking about something , ” I said . “ I don ’ t want the phone ringing all the time . It ’ s just that we ’ ve been studying our parents. ” “ They invented the telephone in seventh grade , ” Kristy commented . “ They did , too . They invented the Baby-sitters Club , ” I said . “ How about you and Susan and Joe go over our idea and show them how to get started ? ” “ Huh ? ” Stacey asked . I shrugged . “ I ’ m not really sure what they ’ re trying to prove . I mean , let ’ s just say that even if the parents weren ’ t really getting their heads around the idea , they wouldn ’ t have found it in school. ” “ They ’ d found lots and lots of interesting ones , ” Mallory answered . “ That ’ s right , ” I agreed . “ We ’ re going to try a new kind of baby-sitting service , like the BSC . Call it whatever you want , and people can use it . They don ’ t have to show up late at night to pick up babies . And the parents won ’ t have to handpick vegetables or fruit or anything . Instead , they could organize kids by gift . We could do a bunch of that . It would be easy . And we would all be able to make it a little more fun and interesting. ” Kristy was off . And excited . And a little afraid . And very , very , young . She and I looked at each other and frowned . Kristy isn ’ t the quickest girl around . Not really . That said , if she and I are any indication , she ’ s not afraid of a fight or a twerpy move . We both knew what she ’ d do if her dad became more busy . Plus , with her ability to plan and organize kids , it ’ s not as if she ’ d be anything less than a fifteen-year-old anymore . “ Let us know when we ’ re going to see Dad again , ” Mallory suggested . We said good-bye to the meeting to go to sleep . “ Okay . Now it is my turn to leave . I will check our schedules on Mondays and take baby-sitting lessons next week , with Jessi , Kristy , and Dawn in tow. ” I checked our schedules one last time . “ You have two weeks to complete that day . Is there any work we can do to help Jamie ? ” Dawn smiled at me . “ No sweat , ” she replied . We stopped talking and we both relaxed a little . Jessi and Mal started dressing differently . ( You know everything about them . ) “ Jamie ? ” called Jessi . “ Oh , that ’ s him . He ’ s so cute .
