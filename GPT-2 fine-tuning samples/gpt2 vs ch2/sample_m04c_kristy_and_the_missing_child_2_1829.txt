rest is history . One of Mrs. Schafer ’ s two kids is Dawn , our club ’ s alternate officer . ( The other is Jeff , Dawn ’ s younger brother . ) What ’ s an alternate officer ? Well , it ’ s like a substitute teacher . If any member can ’ t make it to a meeting , Dawn is prepared to do her job . We call Dawn our California girl , since that ’ s where she came from . Dawn has long blonde hair , blue eyes , a laid-back personality , and casual clothes . No matter how long she lives in Stoneybrook , Dawn will probably always wish she were on a beach , looking at the Pacific Ocean . Dawn ’ s a real individual . She eats health food while the rest of us ( except Stacey ) eat junk , she has two holes pierced in each ear , and doesn ’ t care what anybody else thinks of her . I know I ’ ll never be that cool ! I think Dawn is pretty happy these days , with Mary Anne and her father settled in at the old Schafer house ( and I mean old — it even has a secret passageway that might be haunted ! ) . But there ’ s one thing that ’ s hard for her , and that ’ s how much she misses her brother Jeff . He just never adjusted to Stoneybrook , and he missed his dad like crazy , so it was decided that he should go back to California to live . Poor Dawn . I can ’ t imagine how I ’ d feel if David Michael lived 3,000 miles away ! Claudia , Stacey , Mary Anne , Dawn , and I are all thirteen and in the eighth grade . But the two other members of our club are younger . Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike are both eleven and in the sixth grade . They ’ re best friends . They are also our junior officers , which basically means that they aren ’ t allowed to sit at night for anyone except their own families . This rule was made by their parents , but it ’ s one rule that we can all live with . Jessi and Mal get plenty of afternoon business , so they ’ re happy . And since they take those jobs they free the rest of us for nighttime sitting . So we ’ re happy , too . Mal is someone we used to sit for . She ’ s the oldest in a family of eight kids ! She ’ s a terrific sitter , since she ’ s had so much practice . She has curly red hair , glasses , and braces . She ’ d love to wear contacts , but her parents say she ’ s too young . Mal loves to read , and she also loves to write . Someday she wants to write and illustrate kids ’ books ! Jessi also loves to read , but she has other ambitions . She wants to be a ballet dancer , and she ’ s already well on her way . She takes a zillion dance classes , and she ’ s extremely talented . Jessi ’ s family is much smaller than Mal ’ s ; she has one younger sister and a baby brother . The Ramseys are one of the few black families in Stoneybrook , by the way . When Jessi first moved here , that fact made her life a little rough . Not everybody was ready to accept her family — just because of their color . But now the Ramseys are part of the community . There are two other club members I haven ’ t told you about : our associate members . They don ’ t come to meetings , but they ’ re ready and willing to take on jobs we can ’ t cover . One of them is Shannon Kilbourne , a girl from my neighborhood . The other is a boy named Logan Bruno . Remember I told you that Mary Anne is the only club member with a steady boyfriend ? Well , Logan ’ s the one . He ’ s a great guy . I ’ d been thinking so hard about the BSC and its members that I was in kind of a fog . But suddenly I heard a wild honking and screeching coming from all around me . I looked up to see that Jessi , Mal , Claudia , Stacey , and Dawn had joined me and Mary Anne on the lawn — and each of them was blowing on a blade of grass ! They sounded like some kind of crazy orchestra . I cracked up . Then I held up my hands and started to conduct them . When they finished their “ symphony , ” we rolled around laughing for a few minutes until I glanced at my watch and realized it was nearly five-thirty . We raced upstairs , just in time to hear the phone in Claud ’ s room ring . I grabbed it . “ Baby-sitter ’ s Club ! ” I said , panting . “ Can I help you ? ” That was the first of many calls that afternoon , but between calls , we managed to talk a lot . Mary Anne told us about her awful home-ec class . I told everybody about the big practice game the Krushers would be having the next day , against Bart ’ s Bashers . ( Bart is this guy I like . He ’ s the coach of my team ’ s main rivals . I wouldn ’ t exactly call him my boyfriend , but , well , you know . ) We also talked a lot about the Awards Night that was going to take
