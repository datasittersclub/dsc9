“ Any new business ? ” Kristy asked . Funny how that question quiets us down . Suddenly we looked like a math class . Finally Stacey , our treasurer , held up a manila envelope and announced , “ Dues day ! ” “ Oh no , it ’ s Monday , ” Jessi said with a groan . “ Do we have to ? ” Claudia moaned . “ Can ’ t we skip a day ? ” Mal asked . Grumbling about dues is kind of a BSC tradition . We don ’ t really mean it . But I ’ m glad I ’ m not treasurer . I wouldn ’ t be able to stand the teasing . Stacey just smiles and shrugs . She ’ s so good-natured . And not just about the grumbling . About the junk food , too . You see , Stacey ’ s a diabetic and she ’ s not allowed to eat sweets . Her body can ’ t handle sugar properly . ( She has to give herself injections of something called insulin every day . Can you imagine ? ) As treasurer , Stacey ’ s in charge of paying our expenses : Claud ’ s phone bill , gas money for Kristy ’ s chauffeur ( actually , her brother ) , and supplies for the Kid-Kits we take on our jobs ( boxes full of toys , games , books , and puzzles ) . Stace is a real math whiz , so the job is a cinch for her . What ’ s Stacey like ? Smart , friendly , and gorgeous . She has long blonde hair and blue eyes , and she wears the most beautiful clothes . If you see something in a catalog or store window that takes your breath away , chances are Stacey already has it . She says she picked up her fashion sense in New York City . That ’ s where she grew up . Was she a lucky kid ! I think the Big Apple is the most exciting place in the world . “ Hmm , ” Stacey said with a smile , peering into the bulging envelope . “ Almost enough to buy that suede jacket I saw at Bellair ’ s , ” she teased . “ Don ’ t you dare ! ” Claudia blurted out . “ Not unless you take me with you. ” “ I could use some new tights , ” Jessi said . “ I need sackbut lessons , ” Shannon added . “ Sackbut ? ” Claudia howled . I thought she would fall off the bed . Shannon shrugged . “ Yeah . It ’ s sort of like the trombone . I heard it in this early-music concert . It sounds cool. ” Shannon Kilbourne is the only person in the world who would even think of something like sackbut lessons . She ’ s multitalented and interested in everything . At first none of us knew her well , because she goes to a private school called Stoneybrook Day School . She also lives way across town , in Stoneybrook ’ s wealthy neighborhood . Shannon used to be an associate , like Logan . Now she ’ s temporarily replacing Dawn as our alternate officer , which means she covers for anyone who ’ s absent . We ’ ve all grown close to her . She ’ s friendly and open , with curly blonde hair and the most beautiful , clear , blue eyes . How did Shannon end up in the Baby-sitters Club ? Kristy recruited her . They ’ re neighbors . Sigh . Just saying that makes me sad . I used to be Kristy ’ s neighbor . We lived next door to each other , right across the street from Claudia ’ s house . We ’ ve been best friends since our idea of conversation was “ Goo. ” We even look alike — both petite , with dark brown hair and brown eyes . That ’ s where the similarities end , though . Kristy is take-charge and outspoken , and she loves sports . ( My idea of aerobic exercise is a walk around the bookstore . ) She ’ s also the most casual dresser in the club . To her , “ dressing up ” equals “ not wearing sweats and jeans. ” Kristy , by the way , is the mastermind behind the Baby-sitters Club . The idea popped into her head one day when we were in seventh grade . Boy , were our lives different then . We were still next-door neighbors . I was living with Dad , and Kristy lived with her mom and three brothers — Charlie ( who ’ s now seventeen ) , Sam ( fifteen ) , and David Michael ( seven ) . Kristy ’ s dad had abandoned their family right after David Michael was born . What an awful thing to do , huh ? It sure wasn ’ t easy for Mrs. Thomas . Anyway , one night Kristy saw her mom frantically calling around for a sitter , and bing ! Kristy thought , why not have an organized group of sitters , like an agency ? Kristy , Claudia , Stacey , and I were the first BSC members . ( Kristy , of course , is president . ) Before long we were getting tons of business . That ’ s how Kristy views us — as a business . It was her idea to have officers , dues , a notebook , and a record book . She even made sure we put up fliers in public places to advertise ourselves . Soon we expanded to nine members . When Dawn left , Kristy was afraid we wouldn ’ t have enough sitters to go around . But so far , we ’ ve managed nicely . Now you know everything about the
