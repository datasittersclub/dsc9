, and I would try to eat them . That pretty much sums us up . None of us ever knew Mrs. Spier . She died when Mary Anne was a baby . Mr. Spier raised Mary Anne with tons of rules . She had a super-early curfew and had to wear pigtailed hair and little-girl dresses to school . Forget about getting her ears pierced . The trouble was , Mary Anne was too sweet and shy to complain , so it took awhile for her dad to realize she needed to grow up . Mary Anne ’ s life changed a lot when Dawn Schafer moved to Stoneybrook from California and joined the BSC . Dawn and Mary Anne discovered that Dawn ’ s mom ( who was divorced ) had grown up here and had been Mr. Spier ’ s high school girlfriend . So guess who ended up reuniting , dating , and marrying ? ( With a little help from matchmakers Mary Anne and Dawn . ) The Schafers lived in a rambling , two-hundred-year-old farmhouse , so Mary Anne and her dad moved in with them . Dawn has since moved back to California to live with her dad and brother , and boy , do we miss her . Mary Anne wears normal clothes now , and a pretty cool , short hairstyle . She looks a little like Kristy , short and brown-haired . In fact , Kristy and Mary Anne are best friends — although you ’ d never mistake one for the other . Mary Anne ’ s quiet and sensitive and thoughtful . She ’ s also a top-notch crier . Mention the word “ wedding ” and watch the mist start to form . Logan always teases her for blubbering at movies . ( But let ’ s face it , he loves it . The sadder the movie , the more she snuggles with him . ) If Mary Anne wins the BSC Most Sensitive award , Stacey nails down the Most Unique ( nosing out yours truly , I think ) . Why ? Top of the list : She likes math . Because of that rare quality , she ’ s the BSC treasurer . On Mondays she collects dues , which the club uses for special events , advertising , my phone bill , and gas money for Charlie Thomas . Stacey ’ s my best friend . She ’ s also the only BSC member to hail from New York City . Personally , I think NYC is the coolest place in the world . You could spend months just going from one art gallery to the next . Stacey spent her whole life there , until her dad ’ s company transferred him to Connecticut . That was when she joined the BSC . But she wasn ’ t here long , because the company made him move back to New York again . Well , all the moving must have worn down her parents ’ marriage , which wasn ’ t doing too well anyway . All of a sudden we heard that they were divorcing , and Stacey was moving back to Stoneybrook with her mom . ( She actually turned down the opportunity to stay in the Big Apple with her dad . Why ? Because of her great friends here , of course . ) You would recognize Stacey instantly at a BSC meeting . She ’ s the only one with blonde hair , and the only one who turns down sweets . Stacey has a condition called diabetes . If she eats too much sugar , she could go into a coma . She can lead a normal life as long as she eats regular , sugar-free meals and injects herself daily with a hormone called insulin . I have seen her do this , and it is not disgusting at all . ( Well , not very . ) Stacey may be good in math , but her passion is fashion . She dresses cool , sleek , and urban . She can predict what the next hot look is going to be , weeks in advance . I guess she picked up that talent while living all those years near New York City boutiques . Too bad Stacey didn ’ t know Abigail Stevenson back then . They might have spotted each other on those crowded Manhattan streets . Abby ’ s a former Long Islander and frequent NYC visitor . Abby and her twin sister , Anna , grew up near the beach , and their mom commuted to her job with a publishing company in the Big Apple . ( Their dad died in a car accident when they were nine , but they don ’ t talk about that much . ) Abby ’ s our alternate officer , which means she takes over the duties of any regular officer who might be absent . Dawn Schafer used to be our alternate . After she moved to California , we tried to function with just six regular members . It was a nightmare . We became so busy , some of us were doing two jobs in a day . We came very close to needing to turn down work ( which would have given Kristy a heart attack ) . Imagine the look on Kristy ’ s face the day Abby and Anna moved into a house down the street from the Brewer mansion . Not one , but two thirteen-year-old girls with great personalities ! I ’ m surprised Kristy didn ’ t drag them by the hair to a meeting . Actually , in a nice , civilized way , we offered both sisters membership . Anna Stevenson turned us down , though , mostly because she ’ s a serious musician who practices all the time . So Abby became our new alternate officer . And boy , are we glad . She ’ s outgoing and hilarious . You would
