stretched , so I sat down next to Claud and told her about her wedding date . So , that was me . I would n't even have liked to have done that . ( Kristy , you were the only one in my department that cared . ) But I knew I could n't turn down such a fabulous wedding invitation . That would be rude . As I settled back in Claud 's chair , Kristy leaned over to look at me with those big , glossy blue eyes . `` Where am I ? '' she asked . ( Her eyes were fixated on Mary Anne 's lap . ) `` I was thinking of having someone go for a baby-sitting job for me , '' I told her . `` I mean , I 'm not exactly a baby-sitter . '' `` Do you see that big smile on Mary Anne 's face ? '' asked Claud . I told her about David Michael 's baby-sitter . `` I saw the smile , '' said Claud . `` The frown . As if it was a secret meeting of the parents . '' Claud smiled and looked at us . `` I hope you see what I 've done . I have n't seen Mary Anne for weeks . '' I tried to imagine Mary Anne going that way . I could tell she was thinking . `` Mary Anne , I think we 're off , '' Mallory said . `` What about this question on the record book ? '' I do n't think I could have guessed she 'd be laughing . `` I do n't think Mary Anne has any plans to go to a baby-sitting job at that time , unless she decides to take some leave . '' `` Okay , let 's see , do you think Mary Anne will be back in her room then ? '' Kristy suggested . It was true , but she would n't get off her horse . She held up a drawer and pulled out a box of tissues . `` It does n't sound like a lot of supplies , '' she said . `` But it sure does , '' said Claud . `` Besides , I want to make some art supplies for the children . '' We nodded . `` I do n't know , Mallory â€¦ oh my lord , '' said Mary Anne . We were n't sure how to answer Mallory 's question . I knew she already knew the answer to that one . As I opened the box , I noticed that it had a couple of pages that were missing . `` You need supplies ? '' I asked . Mary Anne smiled at me . `` Yes . How about art supplies . '' `` I think that 's enough , though , Mr. Pike , '' I pointed out . `` You guys do n't bring art supplies with you every week . But I do n't think it 's enough . '' At that moment , Claud snapped and threw her arms around Mary Anne with both fists . You could tell she was about to go ballistic . She could see that she was going to cry . `` So what you need those supplies for , Mr. Pike ? I mean , all my junk food . We 'll send supplies up a trail if we have to . Add some carrots , some paprika , some green onions , some pickled beans . You could bring a whole bunch of stuff in a row . '' I was going to faint . I knew Claud was not a snob . But I did n't quite want to do it , either . Then Claud 's arms came around and her eyes were full of tears . `` But do n't worry about the supplies . I wo n't do them . I know you guys can help us . We have plenty of junk food in our supermarkets . '' `` We know a number of parents we can reach , '' said Mary Anne , and her voice was full of laughter . `` And we 've had calls from parents who have offered to take a bunch . '' I raised my pencil to my nose and frowned . `` And that 's just my opinion . The list that 's been sent to us now may turn out to be a lot , just ask Claud . '' That was going to make me gag . `` A bunch of kids ? '' I asked . `` A lot of kids just like you guys . And a lot of kids do n't like me . I do n't care whether my opinion is true or not . Parents know they 've got to send us supplies to get rid of the ghosts . That 's a major step , and I think some parents are going to be happy . They might even want to do something about the ghosts . '' `` The children ? The ones that think it 's just a snob 's game , '' Kristy announced , her voice thick with hate . `` But of course they have n't , '' I protested . `` Their game plan is to make us do this . '' `` Which is to send her into the director 's chair , tell her to put her chin on the table , and then shoot her in the back . To convince her that her parents are ready for the BSC . '' Claud squirmed to the floor
