weekly life ? Yes , in some ways better than the one Stacey has . We all have the same kind of life , different kinds of dreams , different talents , similar fears , things you probably would n't want to have a baby-sitter doing . Stacey 's life is sort of normal but her situation can be a little chaotic . Stacey had to go through a tough transition . First of all , her mom found out that her two older brothers , Adam and Sam , needed a sitter to replace their son David Michael . Mrs. Thomas had to find a replacement , but that came along pretty easily . She became very good at it and it turned out that the people who had to replace her ( like Adam ) were real people . She even had the courage to call them back ! Then , one night , Dawn Schafer moved to town . But the Thomases live across the street from Dawn , across an apartment complex that was built in 1795 . They 're neighbors to Kristy 's house and she and the Schafer kids — Dawn 's in California now , Jeff and Mary Anne are in high school — seemed to have a good time hanging out at that house . That 's how we ended up doing the Kid-Kits . These are not boxes filled with cardboard or plastic toys or pictures or markers or something to fill the boxes — boxes filled with baby-sitting materials and supplies . We decorated them ourselves , mostly with stickers and fabric paint . It 's a great way to keep track of who is baby-sitting where and when , because you know who is under what circumstances , when you know what kind of kid you are , what the money might be , and so forth . We sometimes have a Kid-Kit ourselves , or stick a Kid-Kit together . The first one we put together , and I 'd probably take a different job , was for the Rutherford Bader High School French class . We were playing with our hands and feet and Dawn announced , “ This ’ s a Kid-Kit ! ” Then we made the list , and as soon as the door to Claud ’ s bedroom opened she was up at the top , and us kids sitting there giggling . Then Dawn presented the list to Mary Anne , and I said , “ This has only one member who likes French , and no friends. ” I was glad , since I was still in eighth grade , and I thought about how much we needed to pay Claudia and Mary Anne to help out the French . And so , when I returned to seventh , I found Mary Anne and I thought about how much money we ’ d probably need to make it . And so , I was totally blown away . Our class was going into French . The whole class started laughing . We made good use of the time to laugh and laugh until we were on the verge of tears . We were all so happy . I was on my way to the meeting when I heard a knock at Claudia ’ s door . I glanced at Kristy — and Claudia ’ s — and she said , “ Order , please. ” I pulled open Claudia ’ s closet and emerged wearing only a pink T-shirt and pants . I ran my hand through my hair and pressed it together so that it was halfway up my neck . Then I pulled open the lid of Claudia ’ s dresser and found a small box that said “ Vogue , ” and stuck it in Claudia ’ s room . “ I bought all my clothes in my room this week ! ” said Kristy as Mary Anne opened the door for me . She looked at the clock on Claud ’ s desk , which had just clicked past 5:26 . “ So , how did all that money go ? ” Claudia asked as she sat cross-legged on Claudia ’ s bed . She sat up a little straighter in case anyone was surprised and had to ask , “ When is the meeting ? ” ( Claudia Kishi lives near the BSC . ) I shook my head slightly . I know that with Kristy , sometimes you just have to smile and wave , and I get that . She tries to be kind , but in a lot of ways she seems angry — even if you know that sometimes she ’ s right . Kristy is not a great student . Kristy has seven younger brothers and sisters , plus one older sister and a baby brother . I didn ’ t see Kristy like that any more . Even though she is a good student , she always makes her parents understand . She gets her teachers to stick by her , and they do . Anyway , Kristy ’ s parents are crazy for her , so they try to force her to go to private school or something like that . They let her down a little bit , though . I think we all sympathized a little bit with Kristy when Kristy was in seventh grade , but I
