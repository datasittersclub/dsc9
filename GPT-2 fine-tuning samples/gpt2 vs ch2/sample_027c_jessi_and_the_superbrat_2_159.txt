in Claudia Kishi ’ s house . Claudia is our vice-president . She has her own bedroom with her own phone and private phone number , and she ’ s nice enough to let us use them for the club . I should probably tell you a little bit about the club members so you know who we are . There ’ re six of us all together . I ’ ll start right at the top . Kristy ? Well , she ’ s … Kristy . Sometimes people think she ’ s a little bossy , but she certainly does know how to take charge of the club , and I really admire her for that . Kristy ’ s a tomboy type . She ’ s short for her age and she ’ s got brown hair and brown eyes . She always wears jeans , a turtleneck , a sweater , and sneakers . I think I ’ d faint if I ever saw her in a dress . Kristy lives with her mom and Nannie ( her grandmother ) , her three brothers , her stepfather ( Watson ) , and her newly adopted little sister , Emily Michelle . Watson has two other kids from when he was married before , and sometimes they come to stay at the house , too . I call it a house , but I ’ ll tell you what it really is — a mansion . No kidding . See , Watson is a millionaire . And when Kristy ’ s mom married him last year , Kristy and her brothers moved over to the ritzy side of town . Kristy still goes to our school , but she does live a little far away from the rest of us . So we pay her brother Charlie to give her a ride to Claudia ’ s house every time we have a meeting . Claudia is about as different from Kristy as you can get . I ’ m talking sun and moon . Claudia is Japanese-American and she ’ s got long , sleek , black hair that she has fixed a different way every time I see her . You wouldn ’ t think there could be so many ways to fix hair . That Monday , for instance , she had two French braids pulled back and wound into one . She ’ s also a wild dresser . At that meeting she was wearing a bright pink T-shirt , a short red flouncy skirt , and underneath the skirt she had on black footless tights that she had rolled up to mid-calf . Claudia has a little bit of trouble in school , but what she ’ s really good at is art . That ’ s probably why she gets such interesting ideas for putting wild and colorful clothes together . She loves to paint and sculpt and make collages , and her room is cluttered with the boxes she keeps all her materials in . She ’ s got boxes of paints , boxes of brushes , and boxes of fabric scraps , interesting bits of paper , ribbon , wood pieces , everything . You name it , Claudia can turn it into art . The only boxes in her room that aren ’ t filled with art supplies are the ones stuffed with junk food . You might not think someone so into art would be into Cheez Doodles and Tastee Cakes , but Claudia is . She keeps a stash in her room and passes it around at all our meetings . The secretary of our club is Mary Anne Spier . Mary Anne is short , like Kristy , and also has brown hair and brown eyes . Sometimes Mary Anne can be on the quiet side , and she ’ s very sensitive ( also romantic ) , but she ’ s extremely organized , and that ’ s exactly what makes her perfect to be club secretary . Mary Anne ’ s job is to schedule all the baby-sitting appointments as they come in . She has to keep track of everyone ’ s schedule , so she always knows who ’ s free when , and believe me , that ’ s a lot to juggle . Take me , for instance . I probably have the busiest schedule of anyone in the club , what with my ballet classes and a semiregular sitting job . Keeping track of me alone is practically a full-time job . Mary Anne ’ s mother died when she was a baby , so she lives alone with her father . Mr. Spier can be kind of strict , but in the past year he ’ s loosened up a lot . Now Mary Anne even has a boyfriend ! His name is Logan Bruno and he ’ s very nice . Can you believe it ? The shyest girl is the one who gets the steady boyfriend ? And to top it off , she ’ s the only club member who has one ! The last important officer is our treasurer , and that ’ s Dawn Schafer . Dawn has long , white-blonde hair and she ’ s a real California girl . Her whole family used to live in southern California , but then her parents got divorced . Now her father lives there with her brother , and Dawn lives here with her mother in an old , restored farmhouse . Dawn ’ s an independent type . She has her own opinions and she does what she likes . For instance , she won ’ t have anything to do with Claudia ’ s junk food . Dawn ’ s strictly a natural-foods girl . Her idea of a good sandwich is tofu , sprouts , and tahini on whole wheat pita bread . Try offering that to Claudia . Those four are the eighth-grade members of the club . Then there ’ s Mallory and
