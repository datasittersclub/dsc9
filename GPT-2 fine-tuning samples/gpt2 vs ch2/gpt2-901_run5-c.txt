I have a big mouth and can be bossy , but we all like each other . One day , one rainy day , we ’ d decided that each of us was going to need a backup dancer . We were going to advertise at my door , and we ’ d arranged a meetup before the first phone call in the world . We were still planning our next move , and I could feel myself thinking about the Baby-sitters Club . I reached out and picked up the receiver for my brother Sam . `` Good night , everyone , '' he said . Good night , everybody . But I soon heard a rumbling in the hallway . It rang again , and I caught Kristy ’ s arm . `` Uh , Stacey ? '' I looked at Kristy . Her face was flushed and her hands on her cheeks . `` Yay . '' She looked up at me and grinned . Then she ran her finger down the list of available dancers . I got to thinking . Where should we send the information ? The Baby-sitters Club was my chance to see if any of them had any dance classes scheduled , and I knew I had to join them ! My mom watches dance too . When she sees someone slip by , she can tell they ’ re trying to instill part of themselves in the child , or instilling some other kind of energy in the child . That way , parents can be certain of knowing about the things that will interest us at the table that night . I thought of it as a way to earn some extra bucks . Kristy checked the list of available sitters , and I checked to make sure no one else was booked . At this point , I knew we could only take it so far , but I knew we had to find the money . A few minutes later , Kristy said , `` I ’ m not too worried . All you have to do is tots . '' We shook our heads . Kristy never worries about understatement . `` I ’ m not too worried , '' she said . `` Just because I have my WISC softball cap , I have to bring it with me on every job . '' Kristy was referring to our new dress code , which I ’ ll explain later . It was much more lenient than what my parents had originally adopted me , and Kristy was referring to the night we were all there ; the entire night after Nicky ’ s birth . Kristy is the BSC ’ s secretary , me the creative director , and Claudia the store manager . ( The BSC also has a dog , a cat , and a boyfriend . They don ’ t have to do any of that at the BSC meeting . They sit at my desk all the time . ) The BSC also has two associate members . They don ’ t regularly attend meetings , but they ’ re on call for afternoons , weekends , and certain vacations . One of them is Logan Bruno , Mary Anne ’ s boyfriend ( he ’ s also an associate member , which means that while we baby-sit , he doesn ’ t attend , but we take some sitting jobs when we can ) . The other is Shannon Kilbourne , one of Mary Anne ’ s favorite ghost stories . As I mentioned , Kristy is president because she ’ s a shot-caller . This was a meeting that didn ’ t begin with . That ’ s because Kristy used to be president . When Dawn first moved to California , Kristy was the alternate officer . Now she ’ s vice-president and associate member . ( She ’ s also in California now , so she might be able to take over when I return . ) Speaking of alternate officers , I should tell you that Shannon and Logan hold special jobs in the school gym , so you ’ ll be well . But that doesn ’ t happen every day . There ’ s even more to know about Kristy and her family . For instance , did you know that Kristy ’ s mom is a librarian ? That ’ s right — she works at a local publishing house , and that Kristy ’ s grandmother , Nannie , moved in to help out ? Oh , yeah , I told you about that . When it comes to pets , Dawn is the shyest , most sensitive of us women . She ’ s also the only member of the BSC who doesn ’ t eat sweets . And her best friend Mary Anne is shy , too . While they adore orange juice ( and soda and whatever else is nearby ) , Mary Anne is totally absentminded . Her only junk food is so-so cookies ( which are honestly more nutrient-dense than Snickers bars ) and Twinkies ( which are more like candy ) . And as if she didn ’ t have enough food ( and bad energy ) , Mary Anne ’ s twin sister , Karen , refuses
