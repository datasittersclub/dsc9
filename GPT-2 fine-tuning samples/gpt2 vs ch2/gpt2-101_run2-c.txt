, the most important job of any officer in the City , for her own family and children , and because every day she 's supposed to write in the BSC 's notebook and to take over every other job , if the BSC has to call someone a day . ( And that 's a pretty big responsibility . ) Claudia ’ s a professional athlete . She ’ s an alternate team member and she has a passion for reading books . She loves science and is an up and coming BSC member . When I first heard about Claudia ’ s talents , I ’ d been thinking I ’ d been watching an athlete get a lot of work — especially at school . I thought maybe she would develop a good sense of humor , although I didn ’ t know how to describe the level of laughter I was getting . It came out in a big way , though : I said things she wasn ’ t funny about . She doesn ’ t have one . For instance , she doesn ’ t like to read children ’ s books . But , she also has a lot of humor in her ideas . For instance , one of the good ones was how she made pizza from fresh tomatoes . Somebody asked her where she had her pizza . She picked up an awful tree and ate its leaves . Then he turned around and picked it up again . Then he went back across the street with the tree trunk , stuck it between the wheels of the car , and pulled out the trunk that he was so impatient to turn around and pull onto the street . A look of bewilderment flashed across his face . “ You want him to drive the car ? ” “ He sure does ! ” he replied , holding out the trunk and the trunk ’ s handle . “ Sure , you want him drive the car. ” “ What ’ s with him driving … I don ’ t know what , ” he said again . “ But you ’ re going to have to keep reading until I turn you over . You ’ ve been through so much at this point. ” “ I mean , that ’ s kind of funny , ” said Claudia . She wasn ’ t sure if she could use some more humor . But she ’ d sure do . When we had finished talking , I turned to the clock . As I began the clock , someone picked up Claudia ’ s phone and said , “ Hello , everybody. ” “ You know who ’ s calling ? ” I said . “ I heard that a big group of kids left home after four-thirty on business . That ’ s just some of the families who stayed in the city after all this time . Not many things are as important anymore . Here ” “ I ’ ll call them , ” said Claudia . “ And I ’ ll tell them. ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ They ’ re still there , ” said the phone operator . “ And “ they ’ ll be back in five minutes. ” “ Uh — ” the phone operator said . “ I had to call the phone back at four-thirty. ” One voice didn ’ t come . “ What ’ s happening ? ” “ It ’ s happening. ” “ But there ’ s no word about what ’ s going to happen to them. ” “ Yes ? ” “ I thought that would be fine. ” “ You ’ re going to have to take over the rest of your life. ” “ Yes ? ” “ You want more jobs ? ” “ Oh , no … ” I said . The voice sounded almost as if it was in my head . “ The next time , I ’ m going to have to deal with this family. ” I sat there a little longer , trying to adjust to the conversation . But finally I got out the phone and called the last number in the BSC . My father ’ s number . He used to be a regular officer at the house . He ’ s still the one who calls the shots to keep things moving . It doesn ’ t take a genius to figure out how the family functions . “ What ’ s that , ” said my father when I said I want to be an officer . ( That ’ s because of the triplets he lost . ) “ You 'll see a lot in the record book , Mrs. McGill is in. ” “ A lot of things are going to happen … ” I said . �
