it or more yellow ? Should your whites be pure or tinted toward gray — or toward brown ? How big should the subject be ? What should be in the background ? I find stuff like that fascinating . A lot of people would find it more interesting to talk about brussels sprouts . I was so deep in thought I didn ’ t even hear Kristy Thomas walk into my room around five-fifteen . ( Kristy ’ s the BSC president . ) “ Hey , Claud , ” she said . “ Oh ! Hi , ” I answered . I must have looked like I was in another world , because Kristy stopped and stared at me . “ What ’ s wrong ? ” she asked . I was about to ask her what she thought about the Snickers–Three Musketeers issue , but I caught myself . She ’ d probably think I was out of my mind . Instead I said , “ Just thinking about a new art project. ” Kristy ’ s eyes lit up . She ’ s always interested in new ideas and challenges . “ Really ? What ? ” “ Well … I ’ m going to work on a series of realistic junk-food portraits . Sort of like Andy Warhol. ” You should have seen Kristy ’ s face . It went totally blank . “ Uh-huh , ” she said , looking around the room . “ Great. ” Whoops . It ’ s not that Kristy is a Philistine ( that ’ s a word Janine taught me — it means “ one who is ignorant of artistic things ” ) . She always has smart things to say about my work . It ’ s just that her idea of a good idea is much more … practical . Kristy ’ s the type of person who will take an impossible problem and figure out how to solve it . Here ’ s an example : Kristy ’ s younger brothers and sister wanted to play on a softball team , but they weren ’ t ready for Little League . So what did Kristy do ? She formed a team by herself , called Kristy ’ s Krushers . From the way Kristy dresses , you ’ d think she was on her way to a softball game every day . She always looks good , just very casual — jeans , a T-shirt or turtleneck , and running shoes . Her face is friendly , with pretty brown eyes and long brown hair . She ’ s on the short side and very athletic . Kristy is the perfect club president . She has the loudest voice ( which helps in a group of talkers like us ) . She ’ s not afraid to say what ’ s on her mind , and she ’ ll boss people around if she has to . Some people are bothered by her bluntness , but we all accept it . She ’ s just … Kristy . I should know . We ’ ve been friends since we were in diapers . The Thomases used to live across the street from me . Back in the old days , the Thomas family was pretty ordinary . It consisted of Kristy , her mom and dad , and her two older brothers , Sam and Charlie . Then , when Kristy was about six , Mr. Thomas just walked out on them . Why ? No one knows for sure , but I think it was a rotten thing to do . Kristy ’ s younger brother , David Michael , had just been born , and all of a sudden Mrs. Thomas had to support four kids . Somehow she managed to juggle a job , child care , shopping , you name it ( I guess that ’ s where Kristy gets her organizational skills ) . Everything changed for Kristy ’ s family not long ago . Mrs. Thomas met this millionaire named Watson Brewer . They fell madly in love and got married , and the Thomases ended up moving into a huge mansion . And let me tell you , that house needs to be huge . Watson is the divorced father of two kids , Karen and Andrew , who spend every other weekend and some vacations and holidays at the house . Then there ’ s Emily Michelle , an adorable two-and-a-half-year-old Vietnamese girl whom Watson and Kristy ’ s mother recently adopted . Then there ’ s Nannie , Kristy ’ s grandmother on her mom ’ s side , who now lives there and helps take care of Emily Michelle . And then there are Boo-Boo and Shannon , a cat and a dog . Needless to say , her house is a pretty wild place . It ’ s also on the other side of town , but of course Kristy ’ s worked that out , too . Her brother Charlie drives her back here for BSC meetings . And she ’ s always the first one to arrive . Take that Friday after the TV show . Ten minutes before anyone else came , there was Kristy , busily helping me clean up . Did I mind ? No way . Before long , Dawn and Mary Anne showed up , then Mallory and Jessi . Stacey arrived last , at 5:28 . That ’ s the whole club . They are my closest friends in the world , and they ’ re all so different . Let me tell you about them . My best friend in the BSC ( and in life ) is Stacey McGill . We have a lot in common , starting with our sense of style . I ’ d say we are both sophisticated , but that sounds stuck-up ( oh well , I said it anyway ) . Stacey is clothes-conscious like me , but in a more
