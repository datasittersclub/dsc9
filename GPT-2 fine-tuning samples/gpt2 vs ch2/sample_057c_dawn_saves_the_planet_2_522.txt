and pertinent facts about their kids ( like if one of them is allergic to milk , or has to be taken to piano lessons on Thursdays , or whatever ) . Mary Anne also uses the record book to assign each of us our jobs . Things can get pretty crazy trying to arrange baby-sitting jobs around our schedules . Jessi has dance lessons , Mal has orthodontist appointments , Kristy has softball practice , and Mary Anne has to remember all that . But she has never made a mistake . Our treasurer is Stacey because she ’ s an absolute math whiz . For awhile , when Stacey was gone , I handled the job . You see , I ’ m the alternate officer in the club . That means if anyone gets sick or moves , I take over her job . Boy , was I glad to see Stacey return to Stoneybrook because , let ’ s face it , math is not one of my strengths . The BSC also has two junior members . We call them “ junior ” because Mallory Pike and Jessica Ramsey are eleven ( the rest of us are thirteen ) . They ’ re not allowed to baby-sit at night , unless it ’ s for their own families , so they take a lot of the afternoon and weekend jobs . Mal and Jessi are best friends and alike in many ways . First of all , they are complete nuts when it comes to horses . Also , they both love to read and are the oldest kids in their families . But they are also very different . Mal has seven brothers and sisters . When Mr. and Mrs. Pike go out , they hire two sitters . Jessi , on the other hand , only has one sister , Becca , and one brother , Squirt . ( His real name is John Philip Ramsey , Jr. , but that ’ s a big name for such a little guy so the nurses at the hospital where he was born nicknamed him Squirt . ) Mal wants to be a writer and illustrator of children ’ s books when she grows up . Jessi would like to be a ballerina . She ’ s a wonderful dancer and has already performed in several professional productions . And Jessi is black and Mal is white , but that doesn ’ t matter to them or anyone in the BSC . Besides the five officers and two junior members , the BSC also has two associate members : Shannon Kilbourne and Mary Anne ’ s boyfriend , Logan Bruno . They don ’ t come to meetings but we call them if we have too many baby-sitting jobs and need a backup . So that ’ s our club . Now I ’ ll tell you how it works . We meet , as I said , three days a week at Claud ’ s house . If a client needs a sitter , he ( or she ) knows to call us during our meetings . This is great because all he has to do is dial one number to reach seven experienced sitters . Usually , one of us is available , and if not , we contact our associates . While we wait for the phone to ring ( and on some days it never stops ! ) we hold our club meeting . Our president Kristy always sits in Claud ’ s director ’ s chair with a visor on her head and a pencil tucked behind one ear . She waits until the digital clock on Claudia ’ s desk turns from 5:29 to 5:30 , and then she calls the meeting to order . Mondays are Dues Days and that ’ s when Stacey collects our money . The dues pay for Claudia ’ s phone bill and for Kristy ’ s older brother , Charlie , to chauffeur her across town . ( She used to live right across the street but Watson ’ s mansion is on the other side of Stoneybrook . ) We also use the money to buy supplies for our Kid-Kits . Kid-Kits were one of Kristy ’ s great ideas . We each got a box and decorated it , then filled it with old toys from our houses , and other things , such as books , stickers , scissors , and glue . The kids love them . I try to vary the things in my kit . You know , one week I ’ ll bring puppets , another week Play-Doh . And when we run out of crayons or coloring books , Stacey gives us money to restock our Kid-Kits . After Stacey has doled out the money and if there ’ s any left over , we sometimes splurge on a pizza party or a trip to the movies . Another of Kristy ’ s great ideas was the BSC notebook . It ’ s kind of like a diary in which each of us writes down our sitting experiences . Writing in it can be a pain , but we agree that the notebook is really useful . It lets us know what ’ s happening in the lives of the families we take care of — if one of the kids is having trouble adjusting to a new baby , or the parents are going through a divorce . This way we can be prepared . So that ’ s our club and how it works . Since today was Monday , I knew we would be busy . I pedaled as fast as I could to Claud ’ s house , raced through her front door and collapsed on her bed just as the clock turned from 5:29 to 5:30 . Kristy raised an eyebrow at the sight of me gasping for air but since I was on time she really couldn ’ t say anything .
