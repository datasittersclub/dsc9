at the barre . Then , when the phone rang , Dad began telling his friends about the Baby Snatcher . He was calling on us to put our club out of business . Now it was up to Dad to find a way to keep the club going . I remember thinking at that point that no one else could stand the Baby Snatcher . But in my opinion , Dad did a good job of it . As I wrote this , I was about to leave Stoneybrook when I heard a phone ring . I looked around the room and made out my club member , Jessica Ramsey . I felt a little shuddered . Stacey was standing by the barre , looking pleased , with the blonde girl in the doorway . Stacey 's first sighting of the Baby Snatcher had been coming in one phone call at a time . We could all agree that it was an excellent idea . But was it really a good idea ? Maybe not . And maybe not at that very late date in the life of a BSC member . But I had to laugh out loud when Mallory Pike , Jessi Ramsey , and I were in the doorway . Jessi , who was about five feet tall with curly reddish-brown hair and a blue-green , two-tweet visor , and Mal , the oldest , was about six ( she is eleven ) . She was sitting across the table from me and looked as if she were about to get petted . `` Good afternoon , club , '' Stacey said . We shook our heads . The phone rang with an announcement about a club meeting . We handed the appointment to Kristy , and then Jessi , Mal , and Jessi stood up . `` I 'll call the meeting , but you better get on the phone , '' Kristy said to Mallory . Mary Anne picked up the receiver . `` We 're going to have to call the meeting back , '' she announced . `` Good , '' replied Jessi . She turned to Mallory . `` That sounds like it 'll be impossible , '' I said . `` Only six club members have ever had to call the meeting back to order , and none of us has ever had to repeat a function . '' `` You would never dream of having such a big group of friends , '' said Kristy . Mary Anne nodded . `` I guess you could , '' she concluded . `` But it would take a lot of work . '' Kristy has long , long hair , blue eyes , a big mouth ( she loves sports ! ) , a passion for sports ( she coaches a little kids ' softball team called Kristy 's Krushers ! ) , and a serious amount of pride in her job . But then something surprising happened to Stacey . She took a few deep breaths , and suddenly she sounded like a true individual . She burst into tears . She had her arms around me as I helped her into the barre at Stoneybrook Middle School , and she and I became friends . I was surprised that Stacey had not been so forceful . She has a lot of self-confidence problems , and she always makes herself available to take a job . But then the next thing I knew , she was crying . I was in hysterics . We fell to the floor as Stacey rushed to the phone . Mom called Mrs. Pike back , and the phone began to ring faster and faster . Stacey 's parents got a divorce , and Stacey went back to New York City where she had spent a lot of time as a baby . After that , she was back in Connecticut . Before I explain the mysteries of the kingdom , let me say that my cousin , Watson Brewer , was the first black family I knew in New York City . Watson grew up in the South , and in fact , he was one of the first people in New York to move to Stoneybrook . After the McGills returned to Stoneybrook , they moved into a rambling old farmhouse . And then Watson and his family came to the Stevens family . It was pretty amazing seeing a group of kids so different . Mary Anne and Stacey moved into Watson 's house one day in the middle of the week when Watson and Mary Anne 's mother could n't find someone to take care of Watson 's kids . So Mary Anne and Watson got together and they began dating . ( That marriage took a turn for the worse when one of Mary Anne 's parents separated when Mary Anne 's father was very young . ) When they married , they fell in love again and got a new baby brother ( a boy ) . Then Watson decided to come back to Stoneybrook from his trip to the Far East , and Watson and Mary Anne fell in love again and married off . After that , everything went from bad to worse . A lot of people did n't like having their parents in the same neighborhood . Maybe most of that was due to Watson and his wife , who thought Mom was n't too nice toward her child . But then things got even worse
