parents always wanted to have another kid after they had me , but they hadn ’ t been able to . Maybe I was finally going to be a big sister . Dad smiled ruefully . “ I wish that were the truth , ” he said , “ but it isn ’ t . I think I better tell you what ’ s really going on before you imagine us colonizing Mars or something. ” I giggled . “ All right , ” he went on . “ This is the truth . Do you remember when my company opened the branch in Stamford ? ” “ Yes , ” I replied . “ Right before we moved here. ” Dad nodded . “ Well , the new branch isn ’ t doing well at all . The company has decided to get rid of it — ” “ Oh , no ! You lost your job ! ” I cried . Frantically , I began to calculate how much money I had saved from baby-sitting jobs , and how far it could be stretched . “ Not quite , ” said Dad . “ They ’ re combining the Stamford branch with the Boston branch . And I ’ m being transferred back to New York. ” After I dropped my knife onto my plate , a silence fell over the room . The room , in fact , became so silent that I could hear the Marshalls ’ dog barking two houses away . “ Stacey ? ” said my mom gently . “ We know this is a surprise , but think how much you ’ ve missed New York. ” “ I know , I know . I am thinking about that. ” I really had missed New York , even though my last few months there had been pretty unhappy , what with doctor visits , and friends who ’ d become former friends , and even a couple of stays in the hospital . On the other hand , I liked Stoneybrook a lot . I didn ’ t have any former friends here , only true , good friends — except for Howie and Dori , the Jerk Twins . And I had the Baby-sitters Club and Charlotte Johanssen and a school I liked and a whole big house , instead of a not-so-big , tenth-floor apartment . “ Think of all the wonderful things we ’ ll have when we move back to the city , ” said my father . “ Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ” “ Central Park and the Donnell Library , ” added my mother . “ Bloomingdale ’ s , Saks , Tiffany ’ s , Benetton , Laura Ashley , Ann Taylor , Bonwit Teller , Bergdorf Goodman , and B. Altman ’ s , ” I added , wondering if my parents would decide I was old enough to get some charge cards . Mom and Dad laughed . “ That ’ s the spirit , ” said my mother . “ Eat your salad. ” ( She watches me like a hawk , to make sure I stick exactly to my special diet . ) I ate a mouthful of salad , and , for good measure , one of chicken . “ When are we moving ? I hope it ’ s at the end of the school year . I ’ m really looking forward to graduating with Claudia. ” My parents glanced at each other . “ I ’ m afraid we can ’ t possibly wait that long , ” my father told me . “ The end of the school year isn ’ t for months . We ’ ll be back in New York four or five weeks from now. ” “ Four or five weeks ? ! ” For the second time that night , I dropped my knife onto my plate . “ The company wants me back as soon as possible , ” said Dad , “ and I plan to do what they ask . I feel lucky that we don ’ t have to pick up and move to Boston. ” “ We put the house on the market today , ” Mom informed me , “ and we ’ ve got real estate agents looking for an apartment in New York . We ’ re going to try to move back to the neighborhood we were in before . That way you ’ ll be near Laine again . Oh , and I talked to Miss Chardon at Parker Academy . You ’ ll be able to rejoin your class there. ” I couldn ’ t believe it . My head was spinning . Should I jump for joy and call Laine with the great news , or burst into tears and call Claudia with the rotten news ? Mom and Dad took my silence for shock and rushed ahead with more promises . “ We ’ re going to try to find a bigger apartment , ” said my mother . “ We ’ ll buy tickets to a show once a month , ” said my father . “ Claudia can visit you anytime. ” “ You can visit her anytime. ” My excitement was growing . It was taking over any other feelings . I remember how I liked to walk down New York streets , and I could almost feel the city pulsing around me . It was noisy and busy and fast . There was something going on in New York at all hours of the day and night . In our old apartment , when I looked out of my bedroom window at night , I could see the city spread out before me , a maze of lighted windows . When I look out my window here at night , I see , well , darkness . Plus , there ’ s not a thing to do in Stoneybrook after 10 P.M. “ Mom
