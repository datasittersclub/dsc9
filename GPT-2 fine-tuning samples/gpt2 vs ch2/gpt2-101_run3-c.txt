The Baby-sitters Club in New York City is open Monday through Thursday from 5:30-6:00 , Saturdays from 5:30-6:00 from 5:30-7:00 , or from 6:00-6:59 , from 5:00-6:00 from 5:00-6:59 for every two weeks of the baby-sitting service . If you are available at the baby-sitters club , we will take you along with you — unless you decide to sit in the Baby-sitters Club for an extended period of time , of which you will have to decide . As a matter of fact , the BSC was built by Nancy and her brother Bill . That 's right , we invented the Baby-sitters Club because Nancy and Bill had been on hand since the great discovery of the Baby-sitters Club two years earlier . After Nancy left for California we decided that we would return to New York . We were thrilled when we found out that she used a little girl — my sister-in-law Kristy from school who has a soft spot for girls . We also decided to find out how the baby-sitting business works . Our meetings begin on Monday at 5:30 , except Kristy wants everyone to come to her Baby-sitters Club once a week so she can take her job ( otherwise known as the Kid-Kit ) . If we do n't have all the kids in a sitting space , we call Dawn and Nancy to come and sit for our kids , which we do . Dawn and Nancy and our club of babies sit , record , in her bedroom . Once a week she will sit during the afternoon and after the lunchbreak in her bedroom . Our clients sometimes sit for just a while . Sometimes they come to our meetings to take our jobs . This is the only time in the afternoon that we keep the BSC secret , because the time for her has changed . We keep a record of everything we do and then call Nancy to come along for meetings even when she needs more kids . Claudia and Shannon are our junior officers . They are our junior officers only . Claud and Shannon are our friends . They are full of energy and want to be great . Our associate members include Charlie McGill ( who 's a certified professional gymnast ) , Shannon Kilbourne ( the newest member from Connecticut ) , Shannon Kilbourne , and Kristy Kilbourne . Claudia is our vice-president . She is in charge of keeping track of all the Baby-sitters Clubs record book entries . Claud always looks over the BSC notebook for our club meetings . After a while , she starts to blur the entries . And while we keep the records we keep , Claudia , Shannon , and Kristy also make up the treasurer of the club . And Claudia keeps a record book for the children our club takes in , along with all the money we earn . The treasurer is our secretary . It 's a simple job we each have to do — sit in the Baby-sitters Club , fill out our club dues , and pay for some junk food and some baby stuff . There are some neat things in the record book about the club that are really cool . For instance , some of all the baby-sitting jobs we do have the treasurer in the back of the room . We also keep the club book , along with the dues we earn , and the books we use to attend meetings . Another cool thing about our club is how fun it is to be a baby-sitter ( that 's why we call Jessi and me after we call her baby-sitter , Margo ) . We all love to be babies , though , and we all love being a little girl . Our club is n't a household name yet , of course . But if we have a steady friend , we should have someone to call on to help make sure we stay organized and keep the record book up to date . We also need someone to check in on the rest of the kids we sit for — especially since Claud has to be very careful . She always collects the funds we pay her and keeps a record book under lock and key . I should tell you something about how my business works . I start our business with the idea that the club should be free , which means that we do n't have to worry about expenses . As long as we meet , the club is free of charges , and we do n't take any money for anything other than our jobs . I mean , we do n't have to make anything , just for our jobs , since we do n't have to give money to anybody for anything . That 's just how we are , with our parents and our brothers and sisters , and with our best friend , my best friend , and our pets . Our record book is full of baby-sitting information .
