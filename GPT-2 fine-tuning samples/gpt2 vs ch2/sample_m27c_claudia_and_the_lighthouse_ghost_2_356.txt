'll be in rockers for the next sighting . '' `` Janine 's astrofistics class is trying to predict whether it 'll hit the earth and wipe us all out , '' I said , pulling a candy box from among my hats . `` Caramels ? '' Mallory looked dismayed . `` Do n't scare me , Claudia . '' `` I thought you wanted caramels , '' I said . `` I meant the comet , '' Mallory replied . `` Astrofistics ? '' Abby murmured . `` Are we really in danger ? '' Jessi asked . `` Nahhhh , '' I said . `` I just used some Comet in the bathroom . That stuff 'll probably burn up in the atmosphere . '' `` Claudiaaaa , '' Stacey groaned . `` I have it ! '' Kristy piped up . `` I have a great idea ! On the night the Veehoff Comet appears , we can have a comet party for all our charges . '' `` Yyyyyes ! '' Abby exclaimed . `` Will we need a telescope ? '' Mary Anne asked . `` Janine has one , '' I volunteered . `` Do n't even think about it ! '' Janine called from her room . `` First things first , '' Kristy said . `` All in favor ? '' `` Ayyyyyye ! '' It was a good idea . Which was n't surprising , coming from Kristy . She 's full of them . Actually , if it were n't for one of her ideas , the Baby-sitters Club would n't exist . It 's kind of a cool story . I 'll start at the beginning . First , there was a Big Bang . Soon the earth and comets were formed . Then , one day , Kristy 's mom was having trouble finding a sitter . So Kristy invented the Baby-sitters Club . Okay , I left out a few details , but that 's close enough . Kristy figured Stoneybrook would benefit from having a group of baby-sitters who met regularly at one central place . Then parents could reach several eager , reliable sitters with one convenient phone call . The BSC started with only Kristy , Mary Anne , Stacey , and me , but we quickly grew to seven ( ten , if you include our two associates and one honorary member ) . Kristy set up the club like a business . Talk about organized . We pay dues , we write about each and every job in a notebook ( which we all read regularly ) , and we have officers with special duties . Our meetings are on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays , from five-thirty to six . During those times , our clients call to request sitters . What happens if they call during other times ? They reach me , usually when I 'm having a cow over my homework . You see , my bedroom is the one-and-only official BSC headquarters , mainly because I 'm the only member with her own private phone line . Which makes me the club 's host , head custodian , junk food caterer , and off-hours switchboard operator . All these duties are combined under one title : vice-president . Kristy , naturally , is president . She runs the meetings , plans our events , dreams up advertising schemes , and makes us all feel horrible and guilty if we 're late for anything . As you can imagine , she 's loud , smart , and full of energy . She 's also short ( barely five feet ) , athletic , and very casual . Super casual . Kristy is to fashion the way I am to astrophysics . Wo n't go near it . We practically have to force her into a dress for school dances . Kristy 's mind is very kid-centered . She always knows exactly what kids want . Take the comet party . No one but Kristy could have thought of that . Not long ago , when she realized that many of our younger charges wanted to play softball , Kristy organized a team for them . It 's called Kristy 's Krushers , and they play all the time during nice weather . Kristy even designed perfect antiboredom devices for us to take to jobs on rainy days . They 're called Kid-Kits — boxes filled with old toys , games , and odds and ends . They do n't sound like much , but kids adore them . Kristy used to live across the street from me , with her parents and three brothers ( Charlie 's now seventeen , Sam 's fifteen , and David Michael 's seven ) . But just after David Michael was born , Kristy 's life really changed . Her dad abandoned the family — walked out and never came back . Mrs. Thomas had to scramble to make a living and support four kids . Things are n't quite so chaotic anymore . Mrs. Thomas remarried , to a divorced guy named Watson Brewer , who just happens to be a gazillionaire . Just like that — zoom ! — Kristy was living in a mansion in Stoneybrook 's chichi neighborhood . Do n't worry . Wealth has n't changed Kristy . It 's just given her more people to boss around . Watson 's two children from his first marriage , seven-year-old Karen and four-year-old Andrew , live in the mansion during alternate months . Watson and Kristy 's mom have a child of their own now , too — they adopted Emily Michelle , a two-year-old who was born in Vietnam . Kristy 's grandmother , Nannie , moved in to help take care of her . The Brewer/Thomases also have lots of pets , so it 's a pretty full house . `` The problem is , '' Kristy was saying , `` where 's the best place to see
