changed . She ’ s happy now and the kids , who really are nice , have settled down . Sort of . “ Dawn ! ” Suzi cried , starting to pout . “ Tell Buddy to let go of my bus. ” Even though Mrs. Barrett hadn ’ t left yet , I realized it was time to take charge . I hopped onto the porch . “ Buddy , there ’ s a red light . What do tow truck drivers do when they see one ? ” Buddy let go of the box and yelled , “ Stop ! ” “ Good. ” I smiled at him and ruffled his hair . Then I whispered to Marnie , “ Say , ding ding. ” “ Ding ! Ding ! ” Marnie shouted . “ What ’ s that mean ? ” Suzi asked . “ It means one of your passengers wants to get off the bus , ” I said . “ You had better open the doors and let her out. ” Suzi , who loves to pretend , made a swooshing sound and opened the door . “ Okay , passenger , ” she said . “ You dinged , so get off. ” Marnie didn ’ t budge . Now the game was getting fun for her . She beamed at me and sang , “ Ding , ding ! Ding , ding ! ” Buddy tugged on the sleeve of my jacket . “ She won ’ t get off the bus . Want me to arrest her ? ” “ I thought you were the tow truck driver , ” I said . “ No. ” Buddy shook his head . “ Now I ’ m the sheriff. ” “ And I ’ m his deputy , ” Suzi added . Luckily , Mrs. Barrett appeared at the front door before things became too confusing . She looked like a model . I ’ m not kidding . She was wearing cream-colored linen slacks , a blazer , and a lavender silk blouse with a pearl necklace and earrings . “ You look wonderful , ” I told her . “ Oh , do you think so ? ” she asked , nervously patting her wavy hair . “ Franklin DeWitt is taking me to Chez Maurice for dinner. ” “ Chez Maurice is one of my favorite restaurants , ” I said . “ We always go there for really special occasions , like Mom ’ s birthday or when Mom and Richard got married. ” “ It ’ s Franklin ’ s favorite , too . He knows Maurice , ” Mrs. Barrett said . Her cheeks flushed a little brighter pink as she spoke . “ The number of the restaurant is on the bulletin board in the kitchen , ” Mrs. Barrett explained as she checked the tiny gold watch circling her wrist . “ There ’ re French fries and hamburger patties in the freezer for the kids ’ dinner . You can have them eat in about half an hour. ” “ All right. ” I was really impressed at how organized Mrs. Barrett had become . When I first baby-sat for her , she was a disaster . Sometimes she forgot to tell me where she was going or when she ’ d be home . Her house was always messy , so I ended up doing her housework . I even planned the meals . It was really too much for me . So , after serious discussions with the BSC , I finally had a talk with Mrs. Barrett . Now it ’ s amazing how much she ’ s changed . “ I ’ m meeting Franklin downtown . We ’ re just going to dinner and then coming right home. ” She smiled at her three children . “ Franklin wants to spend time with the kids. ” “ Great ! ” Buddy cried . “ We can kick the soccer ball around . Or maybe wrestle . We did that last week and it was fun ! ” Mrs. Barrett looked extra pleased that Buddy felt that way about Franklin , which made me realize her new relationship was pretty serious . We waved good-bye to Mrs. Barrett , and before the kids could return to their game of the sheriff versus the bus passenger , I said , “ What do you say we go inside and play ? ” “ But I want to wait for Franklin , ” Suzi said . “ They ’ re going to a restaurant first . Then they ’ re coming home , ” I explained . “ Hey , I ’ ve got an idea . Why don ’ t we eat dinner while they ’ re eating . We can pretend we ’ re in a restaurant , just like Franklin and your mom. ” The kids liked that idea . We spent the next three hours playing restaurant . First we made menus using crayons and notebook paper . Buddy and Suzi drew pictures of their favorite foods . “ What kind of food is that ? ” I asked Suzi as she carefully drew big red circles all over her paper . “ Hamburger , ” she replied . “ And pizza and donuts. ” It was hard for me not to wince . Like I said , I don ’ t eat red meat or fatty foods . “ How about you , Buddy ? ” I asked . “ What are you drawing on your menu ? ” Buddy drew a stick man holding a hot dog . “ This is Franklin , ” he said . “ Eating a hot dog . I like hot dogs . Franklin gave us hot dogs last week. ” “ Oh , did you go to his house ? ” I asked as I drew my own pictures of a spinach salad with avocado slices on whole wheat toast . “
