the director 's chair that she always sits in during club meetings . `` If you guys want , we can organize the kids and help spread the word . Maybe we can even do a few projects to help raise money for Babar . '' I love it when Kristy gets excited about a project . She puts herself one hundred percent behind it and makes it happen . Take the Baby-sitters Club , one of her greatest ideas of all time . She came up with the idea to form the club while sitting in her kitchen one day , listening to her mom try to find a baby-sitter . You see , Kristy 's father walked out on her family when Kristy was six and never looked back . That left Kristy 's mom to work and raise four kids . Anyway , on that afternoon last year , Mrs. Thomas ( that was her name then ) made phone call after phone call trying to find someone to take care of David Michael , Kristy 's younger brother ( he 's seven and a half now ) . That 's when the great idea hit Kristy like a bolt out of the blue . Why not form a club consisting of responsible , experienced sitters ? Parents could make one call , to the club , and reach a whole bunch of good sitters at once . Brilliant , huh ? In the beginning , there were only four of us — me , Kristy , Claudia , and Stacey McGill . Claudia , who is a fantastic artist , designed our flyers and the club was on its way . We decided to meet three times a week , on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays from five-thirty to six in Claud 's room . Kristy and I used to live across the street from Claudia on Bradford Court . That 's all changed now . I already told you that my dad married Sharon and we moved into their farmhouse . Well , Kristy 's mom married Watson Brewer ( a genuine millionaire ) and Kristy and her three brothers — Charlie , age seventeen , Sam , age fifteen , and David Michael — moved into his big beautiful mansion on the other side of town . Watson has two kids from his first marriage , seven-year-old Karen and Andrew , who 's four . After he married Mrs. Thomas ( now Mrs . Brewer ) , they adopted Emily Michelle , a two-year-old from Vietnam . Then Nannie , Kristy 's grandmother , moved in to help look after everybody . When Karen and Andrew are living at the big house ( they call their mom 's house the little house ) , which is every other month , there are ten people at the Brewer mansion . It 's a good thing it 's so huge . But anyway , in the beginning , when the club was formed , Kristy and Claudia and Stacey and I were neighbors . We decided to hold our meetings at Claud 's because she has a phone in her room and — are you ready for this ? — it 's not just an extension , it 's her very own phone line . Kristy became president because the club was her idea and because she 's a real leader . ( Some people would say she 's loud and bossy , but I prefer to call her strong-willed . ) We can count on Kristy to be at every meeting in her jeans , sneakers , and a turtleneck shirt . She usually wears her baseball cap placed firmly on her brown hair , which is pulled into a ponytail . Since we were holding meetings at Claudia 's , we elected her vice-president . Claud does a lot of things for the club , such as pick up calls when the club 's not in session and supply us with snacks . She is also our resident artist and all-around cool , creative person . In the looks category , I would say that Claudia is gorgeous with her shiny jet black hair and perfect clear complexion . Claudia does have a couple of flaws . ( Do n't we all ? ) One , she is a major junk food addict . I 'm not kidding . She stashes cookies and candy bars all over her room . And two , although she is very smart , schoolwork is Claudia 's nemesis . She can paint a picture of clouds soaring over a summer landscape with her eyes closed , but ask her to diagram a sentence and she freezes up completely . At one point her parents were so concerned about her falling behind in her studies that they asked her to consider quitting the BSC . It was awful . Fortunately , Claudia pulled her grades up so she did n't have to quit . But we understand that , for Claudia , homework has to come first . Stacey McGill , who is a real math whiz , was our first treasurer . She and Claudia are a lot alike . Both have the absolute coolest clothes — not because they 're rich and can afford to buy a million outfits , but because they have a real sense of style . Claudia will go to a used clothing store and buy an old black vest , a beat-up derby , and an old-fashioned collarless shirt for a few dollars . Then she 'll add some lace and beads to the vest to make it extra funky . She 'll make a sequined headband for the derby and belt the big white shirt over some wild leggings and voilà ! She looks like a million dollars . Stacey 's style is just as cool , but a little more sophisticated and sleek . I think it comes from the fact that she lived in New York City for such a long time
