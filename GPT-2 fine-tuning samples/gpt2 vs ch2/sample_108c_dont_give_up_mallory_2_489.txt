During that time , we catch up on gossip , eat junk food ( courtesy of Claud ) , and , most important , take clients ’ calls . And boy , do they call . Some days the phone doesn ’ t stop ringing during the entire thirty minutes . In fact , when I arrived at Claudia ’ s , I could hear the phone ringing upstairs . I dropped my bike in the driveway and charged through the front door and straight up the stairs to Claud ’ s room . I was winded and pouring sweat . “ Baby-sitters Club , ” Kristy chirped into the phone . She caught sight of me bent over in the doorway , trying to catch my breath , and arched one eyebrow . I mouthed , “ Sorry , ” to her , then staggered to my usual spot , next to Jessi at the foot of Claud ’ s bed . “ Hi , Mrs. DeWitt , ” Kristy said into the phone . She was still watching me as I tried to wipe the sweat off my face with the bottom of my T-shirt . The corners of her mouth curled up in a smile and I relaxed . Good . Kristy wasn ’ t mad . Kristy can be a pretty strict leader . Some people might even call her bossy , but that ’ s what makes her such a good president . She ’ s the glue that keeps us together , despite the fact that her personal life has been pretty topsy-turvy . First her dad walked out on her mom , leaving Mrs. Thomas with four kids : Charlie and Sam , who are both in high school now ; Kristy , who is an eighth-grader ; and seven-year-old David Michael . Kristy ’ s mom had to struggle for a long while . But then Watson Brewer came into their lives , and nothing was the same again . Watson is — are you ready for this ? — a millionaire . He and Kristy ’ s mom fell in love and wham : Kristy went from living in a nice little house on Bradford Court to this incredibly huge mansion across town on McLelland Road . And that wasn ’ t the only thing that changed . Their family grew bigger and bigger . You see , Watson has two kids from his first marriage — Andrew , who ’ s four , and Karen , who ’ s seven . Then Watson and Mrs . Brewer decided to adopt Emily Michelle , a toddler who was born in Vietnam . During the months Karen and Andrew live at Watson ’ s house ( they alternate ) , there are seven kids around ( almost as many as in my family ) . Luckily for them , Kristy ’ s grandmother , Nannie , moved in to help take care of Emily Michelle ( and everyone else ) . Besides being our president and the main idea person behind all of our great events , Kristy is the coach of Kristy ’ s Krushers , a softball team she formed for some of our younger charges . You ’ d think such a powerhouse person would be tall . But she isn ’ t . She ’ s the shortest girl in the eighth grade . No one would ever mistake Kristy for a clotheshorse , either . Kristy ’ s standard uniform is jeans , a sweatshirt , and a baseball cap pulled over her shoulder-length brown hair . “ Two sitters for the Barrett-DeWitts next Wednesday at six-thirty , ” Kristy called to Mary Anne after she hung up the phone . “ Who ’ s available ? ” Mary Anne ran her finger down the calendar in the BSC record book and said , “ Stacey and Claud , your schedules are clear . Do you want to take this one ? ” Stacey gave Mary Anne a thumbs-up and Claudia , who had crawled into her closet to look for snacks , called over her shoulder , “ Sign me up. ” Mary Anne nodded and printed their names into the calendar in her neat , precise handwriting . Mary Anne , as I mentioned earlier , is Kristy ’ s best friend , which proves that opposites really do attract . While Kristy can sometimes be a real big-mouth , Mary Anne Spier ranks as one of the shyest people on the planet . She is a little taller than Kristy , with a very cool short haircut and big brown eyes that fill with tears at the drop of a hat . I ’ m not kidding . Mary Anne will even cry at TV commercials — especially ones that involve any kind of baby animal ( though kittens , like her own , Tigger , are her favorites ) . Whereas Kristy is a talker , Mary Anne is a great listener . She ’ s sensitive and honest and a true-blue friend . You ’ d think that , being such a shy person , Mary Anne wouldn ’ t have a boyfriend . But she does . In fact , Mary Anne was the first one in the BSC to have a steady guy . Logan Bruno is her boyfriend ’ s name . He ’ s very cute and has this charming Southern accent . But the best thing about him is he likes to baby-sit . In fact , he ’ s one of our associate members . Isn ’ t that cool ? Mary Anne ’ s life has been as complicated as Kristy ’ s . Maybe even more so . You see , Mary Anne ’ s mom died when Mary Anne was a baby . So Mr. Spier had to raise her all by himself . He was a good dad but a little on the overprotective side . He used to make Mary Anne dress in babyish clothes
