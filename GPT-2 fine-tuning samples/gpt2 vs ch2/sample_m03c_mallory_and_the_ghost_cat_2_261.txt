of honor , the director ’ s chair . She had tucked a pencil over her ear , and she was watching the clock . As soon as the numbers clicked to five-thirty , she sat up straight and said , “ Order ! ” Kristy ’ s the president of the club . Why ? Well , mainly because the club was her idea . She thought of it back when she was in seventh grade . She and her friends baby-sat a lot , and she figured they might as well get organized . If they met a few times a week in the same place , parents would know when and where to call for sitters . At first there were only four members in the club ; now there are seven of us — nine if you count our associate members , who don ’ t come to meetings . The club ’ s worked perfectly , right from the start . Parents love the convenience of it , and we love the steady business that comes our way . Kristy ’ s what they call a “ born leader , ” I think . She has a lot of good ideas , and she knows how to put them into practice . She runs the club like a business — like a very efficient , successful business , that is . She figured out when we should meet ( Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays from five-thirty to six ) , how to advertise ( with professional-looking fliers that we hand out whenever we need more business ) , and how to keep a record of our jobs ( we have to write up every job we go on in the club notebook ) . Plus a whole lot more . It ’ s kind of surprising that Kristy ’ s such an organized person . Her home life is what you might call chaotic . She has two older brothers , Charlie and Sam ; plus a little brother named David Michael ; plus a two-and-a-half-year-old sister named Emily Michelle ( she ’ s Vietnamese — Kristy ’ s family adopted her not long ago ) ; plus a stepbrother and stepsister ( their names are Karen and Andrew , and they only stay with Kristy ’ s family part of the time ) . Kristy ’ s grandmother , Nannie , lives with them , too . And of course there ’ s Kristy ’ s mom and her stepfather , Watson . Kristy was unlucky enough to have a father who ran out on her family , but she was lucky to get Watson for a stepfather . He ’ s a millionaire . Honest . Now her huge family lives in his mansion across town . At first , when her mom married Watson , Kristy didn ’ t want to leave her neighborhood ( she lived near all her oldest friends ) . But now I have a feeling she kind of likes her new life . Not that she ’ s stuck up . Kristy ’ s the most “ regular ” person I know . It ’ s just that she ’ s come to love her stepfamily , so that mansion has become a real home . Our club ’ s vice-president is Claudia Kishi . As you might suspect from her name , Claud is Japanese-American . Her family ’ s a little less complicated than Kristy ’ s . It consists of just Claudia , her genius ( really ! ) sister Janine , and their parents . Claud ’ s the vice-president since we hold our meetings in her room . Why ? Because she has not only her own phone , but her own private phone number . So we tie up her phone instead of one that belongs to some adult . We also mess up her bed , try on her jewelry , and eat her junk food , but Claud doesn ’ t seem to mind . Claudia has a lot of junk food around because she loves it , and she has a lot of jewelry because she knows how to make her own ! Claud ’ s a great artist , with an outrageous sense of style . She knows just how to complement her naturally stunning looks ( long silky black hair , almond-shaped eyes , and a perfect complexion ) with the very coolest clothes and accessories . If Claud put as much energy into her schoolwork as she puts into her art and her outfits , she ’ d be making straight A ’ s . But school just isn ’ t that important to Claudia . She has her own priorities , and art is first on the list . Claudia ’ s best friend is Stacey McGill , the club ’ s treasurer . Stacey ’ s a math whiz , which makes her perfect for the job of collecting dues and keeping track of club expenses . It ’ s easy to see why she and Claud are best friends : Stacey ’ s probably the only girl in Stoneybrook who could compete with Claud for the “ Coolest Dresser ” title . She grew up in New York City ( her family moved here when she was in seventh grade ) and she is just about as sophisticated as you might imagine . She gets her blonde hair permed , wears makeup and nail polish , and always looks very well put-together . She seems to have some kind of secret pipeline that keeps her informed about what ’ s hip , what ’ s happening , what ’ s “ in. ” But she ’ s not one of those cool people who make you feel like a dweeb because you ’ re still wearing last year ’ s fashions . Stacey ’ s really , really nice . Stacey ’ s tough , too . She ’ s had some hard times lately
