was n't sure I wanted to get involved because of the trouble she had in her life ( her parents ' divorce , at least ) . Kristy loves the holidays ; when she ’ s not at her desk she ’ s sitting at her computer writing and organizing lists . Her best friend , Mary Anne Spier , was the one who introduced us . They may be younger than the rest of us , but they are identical , as well as different , in some ways . First of all , they both have brown hair and eyes , both like to be in a lot of group situations , and both are organized kids who feel out-bored ( as well as a little frightened ) at school . Second , one of them “ mature ” ( that is , they don ’ t have any kind of sense of humor ) and the other ( not Mary Anne ) of course , the Baby-sitters Club . Kristy , as vice-president , begins her official duties at the meeting . The club meets every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday from five-thirty to six . Most of the time we sit for the kids we care about , but we do have duties as honorary members . We don ’ t have a lot of regular jobs , though , since we love being club members . As vice-president , Mary Anne has the other duties as president and resident official . She is in charge of hospitality . What happens if someone leaves us without something to eat ? She calls it a `` bless . '' If we try to serve the sick , Mary Anne calls that which way ? Now that we ’ re so close , I ’ m usually full of myself . I ’ m not the full-time pajama-cake snob who hates anything that does . As president , Mary Anne has the other responsibilities as vice-president . She ’ ll tell us what to charge our clients with , and she can schedule jobs around the time we need them so we have lots of regulars : our officers , our club members , and our dues . It sounds like a lot , isn ’ t it ? I guess I should explain a little more about the club . The California club is like a large , complicated computer program . My friends know about it from my dot com days . They invented it to run baby-sitting jobs . They ’ re all so supportive of me . I ’ m so happy they keep coming . In fact , I ’ m the only member of the BSC who actually practices and believes in the BSC . She ’ s spending a lot of time these days writing and studying for the club . It ’ s hard work , but Mary Anne ’ s good at what she does . Mary Anne is best friends with Kristy . They are both strong and lovable , both loyal friends and neighbors , but they also share a passion for horses ( their private riding range is so crowded that I ’ ve nicknamed them the Bluebirds ) and baby-sitting . And they both adore reading horse stories . That ’ s another of Kristy ’ s great ideas . Suppose you had to do a hundred questions and voilà ! You ’ d find plenty of non-sequits to fill in the remaining pages . Wouldn ’ t it be neat if you asked Mrs. Winslow , the horse-sitters club treasurer , to arrange for a quiz show and tell the audience which of us can guess at the answers ? That would be neat , but only if the audience thought of it . Mary Anne , who loves mysteries and mysteries and mysteries ( she ’ s thought of all kinds ) , would adore mysteries . And baby-sitting . And mysteries . That ’ s why she ’ s been treasurer for so long that she ’ s been letting her memory hole fill . Mrs. Winslowe used to live on Bradford Court across the street from Kristy . She had two older brothers , two grown-up and one little one , plus a stepbrother and stepsister , a stepbrother who was an only child , and an adopted little girl . In addition to all that , she has lost a brother and sister , a grandmother and an adopted adopted kitten . Mrs. Winslowe went through a hard time with everything that is not knowing her — her diabetes , her grandmother , her adopted little girl , Claudia , her stepsister , and her assorted pets ! Here ’ s what Mrs. Winslowe ’ s family has been through not only in terms of food and family , but in terms of Mary Anne ’ s : ( 1 ) having one younger sister , Janine , plus two older brothers , Sam and Charlie , who are both fifteen , and one younger stepdad , David Michael ( now seventy ) , from his marriage to Sharon ( now seventy-one ) . ( 2 ) having an adopted little girl , whom Mary Anne named Claudia and invited to come live with her three brothers
