go on a sleigh ride . `` Did you say sleigh ride or hay ride ? '' asked Claudia , who is our vice-president . She was sitting cross-legged on her bed , embroidering a sunflower onto a denim shirt . `` Well , it could be either , '' said Kristy . `` It depends on the weather . If there 's snow , we 'll be on a sleigh with runners , but if not , it 'll be a regular hay ride , on a wagon with wheels . '' `` And are you sure it 's free ? '' I asked . I 'm the treasurer of the BSC ( did I mention that math is my favorite subject ? ) , and money matters concern me . `` Definitely , '' said Kristy . `` A client of Watson 's gave it to him as a holiday gift . Watson said he was way too busy to take a sleigh ride — he 's been working really hard lately — and Sam and Charlie thought the idea was totally dorky , so Watson offered it to us . '' Before I go any further , maybe I 'd better explain who Watson , Sam , and Charlie are . Sam and Charlie are Kristy 's older brothers ( she has a younger one , too , named David Michael ) , and Watson ( whose last name is Brewer ) is her stepfather . Not long ago , Kristy 's mom got married again after many years of working hard to raise four kids on her own . ( Kristy 's dad walked out on the family a long time ago . It 's not something she talks about much . ) After the wedding , Watson , who happens to be mega-rich , moved the Thomas family across town to live in his mansion . He has two kids from his first marriage : a boy named Andrew and a girl named Karen . They live at the mansion every other month . Big family , right ? Well , I 'm not done yet . Watson and Kristy 's mom decided they wanted to raise a baby together , so they adopted Emily Michelle , who 's Vietnamese . She 's a toddler , and the family adores her . And once Emily Michelle arrived , Kristy 's grandmother Nannie moved in , too , just to help out . Also , in case you think the mansion might still be a little empty , there are a bunch of pets : a cat , a huge puppy dog , two goldfish , and a rat and a hermit crab . ( The last two are only there when Andrew and Karen are . ) Kristy 's family life may be kind of on the chaotic side , but Kristy herself is one of the most normal , well-balanced people I know . She 's energetic , full of ideas , and just a little bossy at times . She has her priorities straight , too : she spends absolutely no time on clothes or makeup , since those things are n't important to her . Instead , she uses her time to do things she likes , such as coach a little kids ' softball team . `` Um , Kristy , when did you say this sleigh — or hay — ride would be ? '' asked Mary Anne . `` If you give me the date , I 'll check to see if we 're all free . '' She riffled through the pages of the BSC record book , which she , as club secretary , is in charge of . Her small , neat handwriting is on every page . She keeps track of all of our schedules and can tell at a glance which of us is available when a parent calls to set up a job . Mary Anne and Kristy are best friends . They look a little alike : both of them are on the short side with brown hair and eyes . But other than looks , they do n't seem to have much in common . Mary Anne could n't be bossy if her life depended on it . She 's extremely shy , very sentimental , and one of the sweetest people you 'll ever meet . She 's an only child who was brought up by her dad . ( Her mom died when Mary Anne was just a baby . ) `` I do n't think we have a definite date yet , '' said Kristy . `` It would have to be sometime in the next few weeks , I guess , before Christmas . '' `` I wish Dawn could be here for it , '' said Mary Anne wistfully . `` I miss her so much . '' We all miss Dawn . That 's Dawn Schafer , Mary Anne 's stepsister ( and other best friend ) and another member of the BSC . She 's in California now , on an extended visit with her dad and her brother , Jeff . Dawn grew up in California , but when her parents divorced , she and Jeff moved to Stoneybrook with their mom . Mrs. Schafer had grown up in Stoneybrook , so in a way she was coming home . Soon after Dawn moved here , she and Mary Anne became good friends and found out that their parents had dated way back when they were both students at Stoneybrook High . Dawn and Mary Anne schemed to get the old flames back together , and before long , wedding bells were ringing ! ( Is that the most romantic story you 've ever heard , or what ? ) Meanwhile , Dawn 's brother Jeff had moved back to California to live with his dad ( he could n't stand Stoneybrook ) . And then , not long ago , Dawn realized she needed to spend
