, brown eyes , and a passion for art , junk food , and Nancy Drew books . She brings her artistic talents to her style of dress — she even makes a lot of her own jewelry — and looks great in combinations of colors and styles that no one else would be caught dead in . She loves junk food and at every BSC meeting produces excellent sugary and salty treats from hiding places all around her room , including a hollowed-out book . Today , for example , we were eating Dove chocolates , barbecue potato chips , and pretzels . Claudia also loves to read Nancy Drew books , which is a mystery to her parents . ( That ’ s a joke — see ? ) Her mother is a librarian and Claudia ’ s older sister is a real , live genius , so I guess her parents think Claudia should read books such as War and Peace for fun . But apart from Nancy Drew , Claudia doesn ’ t like books , or anything to do with school . She has trouble with every subject , basically , except art . Claudia ’ s an art genius , not an academic one . No doubt her parents will catch on sooner or later . Now stop me if these two friends don ’ t sound totally different . Stacey , Claudia ’ s BF ( best friend ) , is the treasurer of the BSC because she is a math whiz ( as well as a good student in general ) . She ’ s from New York and most of the time looks as if she were a model who stepped off a fashion designer ’ s runway . She has shoulder length blonde hair , blue eyes with dark lashes , pierced ears , and a way about her . She ’ s from New York City originally , and probably the other members of the BSC think she is the most sophisticated of them . True , she is , at least in the way she dresses and views the world . But from what I ’ ve scoped out , she makes some pretty unsophisticated choices . For instance , recently she almost quit the BSC altogether , because she was hanging out with a way cool crowd . The kind of crowd that ’ s too cool to be real friends , which of course you only find out when you need a real friend . Fortunately , Stacey came to her senses and now she ’ s back with the BSC . Stacey was eating the pretzels . She was the only one eating the pretzels . Because she ’ s a diabetic and her body can ’ t handle sugar , she has to be very , very careful about what she eats and when . She even has to give herself injections of insulin every day . If she doesn ’ t do all that , she could become very , very sick , and even go into a coma . She doesn ’ t seem to miss junk food . She can watch her best friend consume amazing quantities of it with amazing calm . Now to the junior officers : Mal and Jessi , who are both in sixth grade at SMS . As junior officers , they can ’ t baby-sit at night , except in their own homes , so they take a lot of afternoon jobs . Shared interests : books , especially mysteries and books about horses ; also horses ; and , of course , kids . ( The # 1 requirement for being in the BSC ! ) Differences : Mal comes from a large family . She has seven siblings , including brothers who are triplets . She has curly red hair and blue eyes , and freckles across her nose . She wears braces and glasses and wants to be a children ’ s book writer and illustrator when she grows up . She ’ s already won a writing contest and she ’ s secretary of her class at SMS . Jessi has black hair , which she often wears pulled back in a bun . She has dark brown eyes and medium brown skin and she walks with the grace of a ballerina . In case you haven ’ t figured it out , Jessi is a ballet dancer . She takes special classes two afternoons a week , gets up every morning at 5:29 to practice at the barre in the basement of her family ’ s house , and has had big roles in at least two ballets ( The Nutcracker was one ) . Jessi ’ s family may be a bit larger than average : She has a younger sister and a baby brother , plus an aunt who lives with them . But it is definitely not as large as Mal ’ s . Have I left anyone out ? Oh . Shannon . Shannon does not fit into the best friend theme . She is an associate member , like Logan , and isn ’ t particularly tight with any one BSC member . Shannon is a neighbor of Kristy ’ s and mine . She attends a private school , Stoneybrook Day School ( where they have to wear uniforms ) . She has thick , curly blonde hair , pale skin , blue eyes , and high cheekbones . She has two younger sisters and a pedigreed Bernese mountain dog , Astrid , who is the mother of Kristy ’ s family ’ s puppy . Shannon and Kristy didn ’ t get along very well when they first met , but they sorted it out . Then Shannon gave Kristy one of Astrid ’ s puppies after Kristy ’ s old collie , Louie , died , and David Michael named it Shannon in honor of Shannon . I wonder if I would feel flattered if someone
