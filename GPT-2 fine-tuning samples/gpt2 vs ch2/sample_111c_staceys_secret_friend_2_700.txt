are most of my BSC friends ) , and I was born in New York City . I still live in the city — part-time , anyway . My parents are divorced , and I spend some weekends with my father , who stayed there after the divorce . What else can I tell you about myself ? I ’ ve already mentioned my diabetes . I have blue eyes and shoulder-length blonde hair . I like clothing and fashion and math . Since I like math , and I ’ m good at it , I ’ m the club treasurer . Each week I collect the dues . ( Everyone grumbles about paying . ) We use the money to replace our supplies , to help pay Claudia ’ s phone bill , and for other expenses . If we find ourselves with surplus funds , we plan a pizza party or something else fun . Who should come next ? My best friend , Claudia . I ’ ve already mentioned that she ’ s an artistic genius . She ’ s great at any kind of art . She even brings her artistry to her unique outfits . Jewelry-making , beadwork , tie-dyeing , weaving — all those things go into making Claudia a one-of-a-kind dresser . She looks fantastic in the outfits she creates . That ’ s partly because she ’ s good at putting them together and partly because she ’ s gorgeous . She ’ s Japanese-American and has beautiful , straight black hair , almond-shaped eyes , and perfect skin . It ’ s amazing that Claudia has perfect skin , since she ’ s a junk food fanatic . Her parents don ’ t approve of junk food , so she stashes the stuff all over her room . Any visitor to Claudia ’ s room is in constant danger of sitting on a concealed bag of potato chips or stepping on a stowed-away Ring-Ding . The other things Claud hides are her Nancy Drew mysteries . Claudia is a big Nancy Drew fan , but her parents don ’ t think the books are “ intellectual ” enough . I suppose they ’ re used to the tastes of Claudia ’ s very intellectual sixteen-year-old sister , Janine . She ’ s an actual genius and very studious . Claudia is not studious . School bores her and it shows . Even though she ’ s thirteen , she ’ s repeating the seventh grade because her grades were very poor . ( Her spelling is beyond belief . ) Since we use her room and her phone , Claudia is our vice-president . She ’ s also in charge of hospitality . With her love of snacks , she ’ s a natural for the job . Kristy Thomas is our president . Talk about a natural for a job ! She ’ s super organized and energetic — a born leader . She ’ s also down-to-earth , talkative , blunt ( sometimes too blunt ) , and athletic . Kristy doesn ’ t look especially presidential . At five feet nothing , she ’ s the shortest girl in the eighth grade . And she ’ s not fashion conscious at all . Her long brown hair is unstyled , and she almost always wears jeans and a sweatshirt , turtleneck , or T-shirt . But Kristy really knows how to get things done . She ’ s always coming up with great ideas . We call her the Idea Machine . One of her great ideas was Kid-Kits . These are boxes — each member has her ( or his ) own — stocked with fun stuff to bring on baby-sitting jobs : craft materials , markers , joke books , hand-me-down toys . We don ’ t take them on every job . But if we think the kids will be shy , or if they ’ re sick or upset about something , we take them along as an extra cheerer-upper . Another of Kristy ’ s ideas was the club notebook . In it , we record what ’ s happened on each of our sitting jobs . It ’ s a very handy reference , especially if you ’ re going to sit for a family for the first time , or you haven ’ t seen them for a while . You can look in the notebook and learn about them from club members who ’ ve recently sat at that household . Kristy ’ s dad ran out on their family back when Kristy ’ s younger brother was a baby . Things were tough for the Thomases , but the Thomases were tougher . Mrs. Thomas remarried . Her new husband is a millionaire named Watson Brewer . When that happened , Kristy and her three brothers ( two older , one younger ) moved across town to Watson ’ s mansion . Watson ’ s kids from his first marriage , Karen ( who ’ s seven ) and Andrew ( four ) , live with them part-time . Kristy ’ s grandmother Nannie lives with them too . She helps take care of two-and-a-half-year-old Emily Michelle , born in Vietnam , whom Watson and Kristy ’ s mother adopted . Down the street from Kristy lives Abby Stevenson . She ’ s our newest member . She moved here from Long Island , which is just outside New York City . At first , I wasn ’ t sure how well Abby would fit in as a BSC member . I was worried because she ’ s as forceful as Kristy — just as outspoken , and just as firm in her opinions . In the beginning , the two of them did clash . But I think they ’ ve grown to appreciate each other . And Abby has a great , wacky sense of humor that goes a long way toward easing tension . She keeps us laughing
