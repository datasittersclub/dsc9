Kilbourne and Logan Bruno . We ’ re all pretty different from one another . But as we like to point out , it ’ s our differences that make us such a good club . We have a lot of different talents and skills among us — enough to handle any situation that comes up . For example , there ’ s Kristy . Kristy is our president not only because the club was her idea ( along with some other great ideas I ’ ll tell you about in a minute ) , but also because she is the Queen of the Organized People of Earth . She is president of the BSC , she coaches a kids ’ softball team called Kristy ’ s Krushers , made up of kids of all ages , she does well in school , and she has a ( sort-of ) boyfriend , Bart , who coaches a rival softball team called Bart ’ s Bashers . Maybe being in a large family makes a person more organized ( it ’ s one of the theories I have about large families , but I never can remember to ask Mal if it ’ s true ) . Like Mal , Kristy ’ s from a large family , although hers is a very different mix . She lives in a mansion with two older brothers , Sam and Charlie ; her younger brother , David Michael ; her mother ; her stepfather , Watson Brewer ( Kristy ’ s father left when she was just a kid and now she hardly ever hears from him ) ; two step-siblings , Karen and Andrew , who stay there part of the time ; Emily Michelle , who is adopted ; Nannie , her maternal grandmother , who helps keep the house organized ; one dog ; one cat ; two goldfish ; a part-time hermit crab ; a part-time rat ; and a ghost . Okay , maybe there isn ’ t a ghost living in the mansion on the third floor , but you get the idea . Kristy grew up with Mary Anne Spier , who is the BSC secretary . Mary Anne and Kristy are both different and alike . They ’ re both short ( Kristy is the shortest person in her class ) and have brown hair , were raised for part of their lives by single parents , now have “ blended ” families , and have always lived in Stoneybrook . In fact , they ’ ve known each other most of their lives . Kristy used to live next door to Mary Anne until her mom married Watson Brewer and her family moved into his house . Then Mary Anne ’ s father remarried and she moved to a new house in Stoneybrook , too . But while Kristy is like a living illustration of “ the squeaky wheel gets the grease ” ( meaning it ’ s the person who speaks up who gets what she wants ) , Mary Anne is just the opposite . Not that she ’ s a wimp . But she is very shy and sensitive , someone who cries easily and has a tender heart . She is also stubborn and very strong . Mary Anne was raised by her father ( her mother died when Mary Anne was just a baby ) who was very strict . Some kids would have wilted under all that loving strictness ( Mr. Spier just wanted to make sure , as a single parent , that he did everything right ) but when Mary Anne realized she was out-growing the little kid clothes and the pigtails he made her wear , she stood up for herself . Now she can dress the way she wants ( within reason , which means that she just dresses casually , like Kristy , but a little more fashionably ) and she can wear a little makeup . And she was even the first of us to have a steady boyfriend , Logan Bruno . Mary Anne ’ s life has changed a lot recently , and not just because she and her father have worked out a less strict , less formal relationship . One of the big changes is that her father got remarried — to Dawn Schafer ’ s mom ! They were high school sweethearts right here in Stoneybrook , but after graduation they went their separate ways . When Dawn ’ s mom returned with her family to Stoneybrook from California after getting divorced , they got back together again , with a little help from Mary Anne and Dawn . Now they all live in an old farmhouse near the edge of town , except for Dawn ’ s brother Jeff , who decided that he wanted to stay in California with his father . And Dawn and Mary Anne are best friends ( yes , Mary Anne has two best friends ) . As you might have guessed , Dawn , our alternate officer , ( responsible for filling in when one of the other officers isn ’ t there ) is from California . And she misses it . She misses it so much that she just spent a huge chunk of time there with her father and Jeff . But now she ’ s back , and everyone is very glad . Dawn looks like an advertisement for the benefits of exercise and healthy eating . It sounds corny , but it ’ s true . She ’ s really beautiful , with long , pale blonde hair , blue eyes , and a strong , tall body ( she ’ s got the perfect body to be a ballet dancer ! ) . Dawn never , ever eats red meat and she hardly ever eats sweets . She ’ s environmentally conscious ( she carries a string bag with her wherever she goes so she doesn ’ t have to use plastic , brings her lunch to school
