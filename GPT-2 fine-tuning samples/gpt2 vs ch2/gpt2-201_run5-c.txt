Kristy calls us back after a meeting after work . We get up and leave , but we take care of business once we 're back . That 's because the meeting house is private . The only private steps are Kristy 's bedroom and a barn , and we usually sit in Claudia 's . Kristy has two private steps and two hallways . We meet at the other part of the house — Dawn ’ s bedroom , when we ’ re not busy looking around for stuff to clean up . If there ’ s one thing Kristy really loves , it ’ s clothes . Like anything in life , clothes get a bad rap . Kristy is a great dresser , but the clothes she makes — some of the most sophisticated — come from fashionably wild places . For example , she makes art accessories and paints — she ’ s a genius ! That she also puts the finest jewelry in the world on the back of the most sophisticated outfit . Another thing that Kristy really likes is makeup . She has her own gorgeous line of bright colors and her own unique way with which she paints . It ’ s really hard to believe , but Kristy makes amazing jewelry , and she really has it covered . Her hair is gorgeous , and Kristy ’ s clothes are so wild and funky . It was a little on Kristy ’ s to-do list for Dawn , except that she came up with it ! Kristy used to dress like that , so I guess I am a little out of it now . Now we have to start with some new friends . The other part of the club wasn ’ t as exciting as the one that was about her . Dawn is the club ’ s secretary . That ’ s not a big one for us — just four of us , plus Kristy and her two adult charges who always sit at her desk . But it was a big part of the meeting for Kristy . “ Hello , guys ! ” Stacey called in the middle of every meeting . “ I 'm here to check on everyone. ” Stacey ’ s in her usual spot . “ We ’ re a business , I ’ ll call you guys back to say hello. ” She takes the long form of all of us . She doesn ’ t sit in Claudia ’ s because she ’ s not going too far . Her room is so small there isn ’ t a lot to do ( our clients often call us in her room to see if we ’ re busy ) . Our clients usually come to her room . ( Our clients aren ’ t as big a client as we are . ) Sometimes Stacey ’ s room is too small , but her business makes up for it . “ Stocking in the record book ? ” I asked . We never do . Kristy and I use the record book for things other than baby-sitting jobs . ( We use the book to look up jobs in the BSC . ) Stacey is the only one of us who has a private phone line . “ What , just for Dawn ’ s baby-sitting problems ? ” I asked . “ Don ’ t you have any work already in the Baby-sitters Club ? ” ( I ’ m starting to get it . ) “ I ’ m going to baby-sit with Dawn , too , but Dawn has to go , ” Stacey said . “ I ’ ll be right back with you and have that baby-sitting appointment. ” “ But … “ Where is the phone ? ” I asked . “ You know how we call our clients during the meeting ? ” Kristy answered . “ No , we just ask for a call. ” “ Can I ask them to be patient ? ” Kristy said . “ How about this : ” Dawn and I would have to be totally honest with each other . Sometimes we have to wait so long for our jobs to come . “ What do you think — is it okay if you do it because you think it ’ s a tough experience ? ” We all nodded . But we ’ d always done something like “ Great ! ” If anything would slow our client down more than it ’ s okay. ” “ I didn ’ t mean to say this is easy , ” Kristy said . We all laughed . Dawn and I always say that we ’ d do anything to get her job . But I guess we were a step behind . ( Kristy and I are both thirteen . ) The phone rang just as Dawn and I hung up and Kristy and I were hanging up and talking again . ( She would later tell me she wished we hung up while she ’ d done it . But she didn�
