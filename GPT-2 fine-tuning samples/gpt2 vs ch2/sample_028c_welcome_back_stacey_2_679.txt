parents could hear me over their shouting ) . I sped up when I reached 12C and ran the last few yards to the elevator . I poked frantically at the down button . A few seconds later , the elevator arrived with a crash . The doors opened up , allowed me inside , and closed . ZOOM . Our elevator never travels naturally . It clanks and swooshes and comes to stomach-dropping stops . The doors opened in the lobby . I ignored Lloyd and Isaac on duty at the desk , and even James as he held the front door open for me . I just ran . I ran by them , out onto the sidewalk , and all the way to my friend Laine Cummings ’ apartment , which is several blocks away . By the time I reached it , I was crying . Laine lives in one of the fanciest apartment buildings in all of New York City . It ’ s called the Dakota . Lots of famous people have lived there , and still do , and I think the movie Rosemary ’ s Baby was filmed in it . Mr. Cummings is a big-time producer of Broadway plays , and Laine ’ s family has buckets of money . Naturally , with so many famous people and so much wealth , the security at the Dakota Apartments is pretty tight . But the guards know me , since Laine and I have been friends for years , so I never have any trouble getting in . Not even on that day when I was crying , and my face was flushed and my hair a mess from all that running . When I reached the door to the Cummingses ’ apartment , Laine opened it , gawked at me for a second , and led me through the living room , down a hallway , and into her bedroom . She closed her door behind us . “ What on earth is wrong ? ” she asked . I couldn ’ t blame her for looking so surprised . After all , I ’ d been fine in school that day . ( Laine and I go to the same private school . ) “ You aren ’ t sick again , are you ? ” she asked worriedly . I shook my head . Then I tried to calm down . I knew that if I spoke , my voice would wobble , so I took a few deep breaths . At last I managed to say , “ I came home from baby-sitting and Mom and Dad were fighting. ” “ Your father ’ s home already ? ” asked Laine . I nodded . “ I don ’ t know when he got there . I didn ’ t even go inside my apartment . I just stood at the door and listened . I could hear almost every word . They were really going at it. ” For some reason , as soon as I said that , I knew I was going to cry . And I did . In a major , awful , hiccuping , gulping way . Laine , who had been kneeling on the floor , moved to the bed and sat down next to me . She put an arm across my shoulder . “ What were they fighting about ? ” she asked after a few moments . “ Oh , ” I said , wiping my eyes , “ everything . Everything in their lives . Money , New York , me. ” “ You ? ” I nodded again . “ I think I was just an excuse , though . Dad said Mom should spend less time shopping and more time with me . But I don ’ t feel , like , neglected or anything . And Mom said she wants to move out of the city because it would be healthier for me , but I don ’ t want to move out of the city. ” “ Move out of the city to where ? ” asked Laine . “ I don ’ t know . I guess to Long Island or someplace nearby. ” “ Oh. ” I looked at Laine . Over the years we ’ ve been through good times and bad times . And we ’ re both pretty sophisticated , having grown up in the city and all , but of the two of us , I ’ d have to say that Laine is more sophisticated . Maybe because of the lifestyle she leads — getting to ride around in limos and going to openings of Broadway plays . And she always looks fantastic . Like , right now , she was wearing this amazing black pants suit . It was made from stretchy cotton . The bottoms of the legs were cuffed , and the top was short-cropped . She was wearing a leopard-skin leotard under the top . Her fluffy brown hair had been permed several weeks earlier and had grown out to that perfect stage . From her ears dangled teardrop-shaped blue and green stones , and on one wrist were about twenty silver bangle bracelets . Even so , Laine somehow seemed very young and innocent just then . Something in her brown eyes reminded me of Grace when she ’ s scared . Laine cleared her throat . “ Um , ” she began , “ nothing like this has ever happened to me . Mom and Dad have never had a huge fight . They argue sometimes , but mostly they get along really well . They spend time together whenever they can , and every now and then I ’ ll catch them exchanging these really private looks that tell me they ’ re still in love with each other . Just like they probably did when they were younger and first got married. ” “ You know what ? ” I whispered .
