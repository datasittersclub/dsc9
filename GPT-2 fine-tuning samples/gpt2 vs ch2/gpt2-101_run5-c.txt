not the least bit of pretense , but when something does seem a little strange , the response is usually one of bewilderment and puzzlement . This is because we are in the business of discovering the hidden mysteries of a particular day , of finding the mysteries of life . Sometimes we think it 's just one of those mysteries that is hidden . It 's a mystery about a particular city . We take it . At one point in our process , when we decided if someone had asked us to help them find the mysteries of their lives , we had taken on the challenge . We thought , if you 're a doctor , it 's just a matter of finding the mysteries of a particular case . But I thought that if you knew a hidden life , you might have an easy answer for the mystery person . So we decided to try some things . When we had found a mystery mother , we told her to stay with us , and she did . We stayed with her for a while . She became good friends with Bruno and Mary Anne ( the Stacey twins ) . We used Claudia 's name again , because of her amazing fashion sense . She had made the best of it . As she sat there with Claudia looking down at her , she could see that all kinds of strange things were happening . Claudia 's face turned purple when she spoke again , because she was having a baby with Claudia , but she knew that her baby was coming , and that was enough to save her life . But then we decided that the Stacey twins were the parents . Not only did they give us the jobs , they also invited us to their mansion . Everyone was very excited about it , and Claudia and Mary Anne were a huge hit , too . All our friends were at the mansion , but everyone felt lucky . It did n't take long before I 'd had it with Claudia . We had both met the Stacey twins by this point ; they were thirteen and identical . And they lived very happily together . We always did things together — I was the one who 'd booked our meeting , and I took over the job of Kristy 's boyfriend , Thomas , who died when we were little . When the BSC was officially formed , the members were excited on all sides , because they had just heard the news . They had to be real happy to have an official club name . That 's how I learned it . ( Kristy had been married to a Vietnam War widower for about six months before the wedding and now lived with her mother . ) The club began in our club room in our bedroom : Mary Anne . When she started getting phone calls about Claudia , Mary Anne felt like sitting next to them all day . ( She was the one who 'd transferred them . So Mary Anne , by the way , is the president of the club . ) Kristy was our BSC secretary . She 's kind of a secret life officer . She collects phone returns and sends them to the treasurer , so everyone knows what 's up with Claudia and her baby-sitting problems . She 's so involved with our BSC — except for occasional problems — she 's so good with the kids . Since we do so much sitting , Mary Anne usually takes on extra duties when it comes to Kristy and Thomas . ( But there are plenty of people who like to sit with Mary Anne , who both adore Mary Anne . ) When her sister , Kristy 's mommy , comes to town , she 'll drive Kristy away . But when her father comes back , she keeps his place — sometimes , but mostly , she stays with Kristy . Her mommy has been my best friend since I was a baby — and the biggest influence on my life is my motherm . We 're very similar , but Mary Anne 's mother was a big influence on me . She 's an English teacher and sports teacher . She 's also a realist , which makes her a good bet for any job at our club . I like that she 's the treasurer and so I 'm the club 's alternate officer . ( We associate our jobs with that , too — in case you think it 's just Mary Anne . ) The alternate officer in my second job is Dawn Brewer . She 's the club 's secretary . She 's so involved with all our BSC matters , she can handle most of them herself ( except for Kristy 's , which she 's the president of . ) I guess that gives her a lot of energy if you count her sitting time every Friday for weeks . Here she is , sitting with Thomas in a row behind her . By the way , if you want a little more information , here 's a summary of all sorts of events . If you 're looking for a great job , or just want a chance to meet some good people , come back tomorrow ( the BSC meeting ) . Then come up with a plan for the afternoon meeting . It 'll include brainstorming , writing , and sometimes talking . I 've had this idea for almost a year now . It 's called the `` Saturday Kid ’ s ''
