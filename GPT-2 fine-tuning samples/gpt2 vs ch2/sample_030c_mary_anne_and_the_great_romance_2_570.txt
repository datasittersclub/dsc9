running shoes . Sometimes she wears a baseball cap with a picture of a collie on it . That ’ s because her family used to own this wonderful old collie , Louie , but he got sick and had to be put to sleep . Now they have a Bernese mountain dog named Shannon , plus Watson has this old , fat cat named Boo-Boo . A few others things about Kristy — she has a BIG mouth ( she just can ’ t help saying what she ’ s thinking ) , she gets lots of good ideas ( the idea for the Baby-sitters Club was hers ) , and most important , she ’ s terrific with kids . Claudia Kishi is the vice-president of the BSC . I always think it ’ s so weird that Claudia , Kristy , and I could have grown up together ( right from the time we were born ) and have wound up as such different people . Claudia is one of the coolest people I know . She has an artistic flair that extends to her clothing and hair and just generally the way she looks . What I mean is that Claud is a terrific artist — she can paint , draw , sculpt , make collages , you name it — and those talents show up in her appearance . She always wears the trendiest outfits . For instance , at our last meeting she was wearing layers — a shocking-pink tunic over a white shirt with pink and yellow umbrellas printed on it . Over the tunic was a wide , low-slung yellow belt with a pink plastic buckle . The shirt , but not the tunic , was tucked into a pair of black knickers , and below the knickers were yellow stockings . Then there ’ s her hair . Claud ’ s hair is something else . Her family is Japanese-American , and Claud has this shiny , black hair . But her hair isn ’ t just shiny and dark , it ’ s long . And Claud can find a million ways to wear it . At that last meeting , she had divided it into five braids and had woven pink and yellow ribbons into the braids . Claud also has dark , almond-shaped eyes and a super-creamy complexion . She is so cool . Claud lives with her parents and her older sister , Janine , who is a true genius . Janine is so smart that even though she ’ s only in high school she takes classes at the local community college . Claudia ’ s grandmother , Mimi , who was a very special person , used to live with her family , but Mimi died not long ago . That was really sad . Here ’ s what Claud likes : art , junk food , and Nancy Drew mysteries . Her room is a real mess because she ’ s got art supplies scattered everywhere . And since her parents don ’ t approve of either Claud ’ s junk-food habit or Nancy Drew , she has to stash those books and the food where they won ’ t be found . She ’ s got mysteries under her mattress and candy in her desk drawers . Here ’ s what Claud doesn ’ t like : school . She ’ s very smart , but her teachers are always saying that she doesn ’ t apply herself . Mr. and Mrs. Kishi finally had to tell Claud that the only way she could stay in the BSC was if she kept her grades up to at least a C average . So far , she has . I ’ m the secretary of the club , and I guess you already know pretty much about me . I ’ m on the shy side , my dad dates Dawn ’ s mom , I live with my father and Tigger , and Dawn and Kristy are my best friends . I lost my mother when I was very little , and I ’ ve grown up in the house I was born in . Here are some things you don ’ t know about me yet : I actually look a little like Kristy . I ’ ve got brown hair and brown eyes , too , and I used to be on the short side , but now I ’ m growing . I ’ m a couple of inches taller than Kristy . Also , until recently I didn ’ t care much about the way I looked . Well , that ’ s not true . The fact of the matter is that Dad used to pick out my clothes for me and I always ended up looking like a baby in these dumb jumpers or plaid kilts . But when he loosened up , he let me pick out my own clothes . I ’ m nowhere near as cool as Claudia , but I did buy some neat stuff . If Claud ’ s fashion sense could be rated a ten , and Kristy ’ s a two , I guess I must be about a six . Maybe a seven . Another thing about me : I am very sensitive . This is good and bad . It ’ s good because I think it makes me more understanding of other people . My friends in the BSC often come to me when they have problems because they know I ’ ll listen and be sympathetic and sometimes offer advice , but I try not to judge them — just to understand them . Being sensitive is bad because I cry at the least little thing . I ’ m incredibly sentimental . Maybe being sentimental is why I ’ m the only one in the club to have … a boyfriend ! Can you believe it ? I barely can . His name is Logan Bruno and he comes
