charge . Claudia , Dawn , and Mary Anne loll around on the bed , and Jessi and Mal sit on the floor . We hold our meetings in Claudia ’ s room . She has her own phone . This is how our club works : Three times a week , on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays from five-thirty until six , our club meets in Claudia ’ s bedroom . People who need sitters call us during our meetings . They ’ re practically guaranteed a sitter . With six club members , one of us is bound to be free . So we wind up with lots of jobs . Pretty neat , huh ? The idea for the club was mine . ( That ’ s how I got to be the president . ) It came to me way back at the beginning of seventh grade , before Mom was really thinking about marrying Watson . We still lived in this neighborhood then . In fact , we lived right across the street from Claudia . Anyway , one day Mom needed a sitter for David Michael , who had just turned six . I wasn ’ t free and neither was Sam nor Charlie . So Mom got on the phone and began making call after call , trying to find a sitter . I felt bad for my mother , and even worse for David Michael , who was watching everything . And that was when I got my great idea . Wouldn ’ t it be wonderful if Mom could make just one call and reach a whole bunch of baby-sitters at once ? She ’ d find a sitter much faster that way . So I got together with Mary Anne and Claudia and told them about my idea . We decided to form the Baby-sitters Club . We also decided we ’ d need more than three members , so we asked Stacey McGill , a new friend of Claudia ’ s , to join the club , too . Stacey had just moved to Stoneybrook from New York City because her father ’ s job had changed . I could see right away why she and Claudia had become friends so fast . Stacey awed Mary Anne and me . She seemed years older than twelve — very sophisticated with trendy clothes , pierced ears , and permed hair . But she was also very nice . Furthermore , she ’ d had plenty of baby-sitting experience in New York , so we knew she ’ d be a good addition to the club . After Stacey agreed to join us , we sent around fliers and ran an ad in Stoneybrook ’ s newspaper so people would know when to call us — and we were in business ! The club was great . By the time Dawn moved to town , we needed another sitter , and later , when Stacey moved back to New York , we were doing so much business that we replaced her with both Jessi and Mal . And somewhere along the line we decided that we better have a couple of people lined up whom we could call on in case none of us could take a job . So we signed up two associate members , Shannon Kilbourne and Logan Bruno . Shannon lives across the street from me in my new neighborhood . We ’ re friends , sort of . Logan is a boy — and he ’ s Mary Anne ’ s boyfriend ! Shannon and Logan don ’ t come to the meetings . We just call them when we need them , so that we don ’ t have to disappoint any of our clients by saying that no sitters are available . I run our meetings in the most businesslike way I can . As president , that ’ s my job . Also , I come up with ideas for the club and generally just try to keep things going smoothly . The job of the vice-president is , well … To be honest , Claudia Kishi is the vice-president because she has her own phone and personal , private phone number . The club uses her phone so we don ’ t have to tie up some grownup ’ s phone three times a week . The only thing is , our clients sometimes forget when our meetings are and call at other times . Claudia has to deal with those job offers , and she handles things really well . Mary Anne Spier , our secretary , has the biggest job of any of us . Our club has a notebook ( I ’ ll tell you about that soon ) and a record book . Mary Anne is the one who keeps the record book in order and up-to-date . She writes down our clients ’ names , addresses , and phone numbers and is responsible for scheduling all our sitting jobs on the appointment pages . This is more difficult than it sounds , since she has to keep track of things like Jessi ’ s ballet classes , Claud ’ s art lessons , Mal ’ s orthodontist appointments , and you name it . I don ’ t think Mary Anne has ever made a mistake , though . Our treasurer , Dawn Schafer , collects dues from us every Monday and keeps track of the money that ’ s in our treasury . We use the money for three things . One , to pay Charlie to drive me to and from the meetings , since I live so far from Claudia now . Two , for club parties and sleepovers . Every now and then we like to give ourselves a treat . Three , to buy materials for Kid-Kits . What are Kid-Kits ? Well , they ’ re one of my ideas . A Kid-Kit is a box that we fill with our old toys ,
