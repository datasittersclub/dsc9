pretty bad about the way she dresses now , since she had to move away from Bradford Court , since her dad 's company transferred him here . ( Mr. Peters had bought it for about the same price as the day before , when he got divorced so I suppose he put the Thomases through for the second time . ) Kristy 's life has been pretty different , too , since her mom remarried and reintroduced the family to the Kerry and Davidians . But then Kristy and her family moved in , and the Thomases were instantly loved by everyone . I think it was all part of the charm : Kristy 's mom and Watson Brewer got married , and Kristy became Kristy 's whole family friend . I have another clue about Kristy : She has two holes pierced in one ear and one hole in the other , too . You just learn to love pierced ears . At the age of five , when Mom married Watson Brewer , Kristy has an identical twin : a younger sister named Emily Michelle , and a baby brother named John Philip , Jr. Kristy 's Aunt Cecelia also appears in movies and books . She is Aunt Cecelia 's sister , who lives with the Brewers until the divorce . When Kristy 's mom first moved to Stoneybrook , she did so at the request of her dad , who was upset that his high school sweetheart had moved back to New York . Well , that was n't the only reason Mrs. Thomas , who had become a Bat Mitzvah member , had become friends with Mary Anne 's dad before they married . And believe it or not , Kristy and her family were happy to be moving back to Stoneybrook . It was n't long before the Brewer/Thomas family started to value each other , even though the big change was Mary Anne becoming an adopted sister . That was when Kristy 's grandmother , Nannie , moved in . Just like that , the Brewer/Thomas family became a huge part of Stoneybrook culture . And that 's exactly what Watson Brewer , the man Brewer and Kristy 's mom started out with , is doing in real life . He 's working with kids who have grandparents and brothers , and an aunt named Karen who lives with them . It sounds pretty simple , and it is , but it 's incredibly helpful when you 're moving to a new neighborhood and start to learn to be a better child . The kids love it , and then you learn to love yourself . You learn to make friends with people you 've known before . Of course , you 're welcome in any of the new experiences ; just think of all the little things the Brewer/Thomas family already has to do ; such activities as homework and barber practice . ( Which , I think , makes them rich ! ) Kristy 's grandmother Nannie lives with them as well , too , and has become an official BSC member , too . Mary Anne and Watson are best friends , though they 're not very different . They look a little alike : both have tans ; Mary Anne has short blonde hair ; and both wear glasses . They 're neighbors , and they really do miss their parents ; they 're almost as shy as I am , but they 're also very different . For one thing , they do n't talk much about their Christian beliefs . For another , they do not equate bright colors and life . Mary Anne is no longer wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt , which she had covered with the weekend before . Instead , she was wearing something less festive . For example , the cutest T-shirt was a black one piece , over white , and a few colors that stuck out more than the rest of the T-shirt . My friends and I did n't realize our typical Friday BSC meeting was going to feature only one color , black , but when it did , we were wearing the cutest T-shirt in the whole store . Watson was having a great time , talking about how great the meeting was , how he and Mary Anne had become stepsisters , and even mentioning that he thought he was the most interesting guy in the world . All in all , it was a pretty busy day ! I left the meeting at 5:29 with a pimple on my chest . I had been pimped ( maybe that 's just me , but I do n't want to give it up . It 's not right ) and had to stay inside the Watson residence . I was very glad to be there . It gave me a chance to see the pets that people have been giving me , and even visited my dad as I rummaged around in his suitcase . While I was out of the house , Watson , by the way , made a big point of telling me not to eat at Charlie 's pizza parlors . It 's near packed with parlors . He also wanted to change the way people think of Mary Anne , so by the time I left , we 'd changed from pretzels to chicken nuggets . `` Well , listen , Kristy , '' he went on ,
