nodded , looking terrified . `` Yes , '' he said . `` I usually check the place out three times a day . But just as I was starting my rounds here today I had an emergency call about my wife being taken to the hospital . So I took off . Oh , man , I do n't believe this ! '' `` That 's interesting , '' said Sergeant Johnson , who had climbed out of his car by then . `` I had a call right around that time too . An anonymous call , telling me to check out this house . '' Have I mentioned that Sergeant Johnson has the clearest , bluest eyes I 've ever seen ? Well , he does . But at that moment , they looked clouded , almost gray . There was something about that phone call that bothered him . The security guard groaned . `` I 'm going to be out of a job , '' he said . `` What was stolen ? Have you checked the vault yet ? '' `` Vault ? '' asked Officer Hopkins . She exchanged a look with Sergeant Johnson . `` Maybe you 'd better show us where that is . We were just about to do a more complete check of the place . Our backup should be here any minute . '' After making one more number-filled radio call , Sergeant Johnson and the other two took off toward the house , but not before he warned me again to stay in the car . They returned a few minutes later , just as another squad car was pulling up . A short , balding officer jumped out of the car and approached the group . I did n't recognize him either . Another new addition to the Stoneybrook police ? He nodded at Sergeant Johnson and Officer Hopkins . `` I 'm Sergeant Winters , '' he said to Jack Fenton . `` What 's going on here ? And who are these kids ? '' He frowned at me . Officer Hopkins jumped in to update Sergeant Winters . She introduced Jack Fenton , and explained why `` those kids '' were in Sergeant Johnson 's car . She explained about the two phone calls and the break-in . Then she told him that Jack Fenton had wanted to check out a vault he knew about . `` And ? '' asked Sergeant Winters . `` The diamonds are missing , '' reported Jack Fenton . He looked miserable . `` Mr. Golem — that 's Reinhart Golem , the owner of this place — has been keeping a bag of extremely valuable diamonds in a vault . He felt they were much safer here than they would be in a bank , since this house is so out-of-the-way . '' I gasped , and so did Karen and David Michael . Diamonds ? This was getting more interesting by the minute . `` We told him to put them in a bank . '' Jack Fenton was still talking . `` My boss told him it was a mistake to have them here . But would he listen ? No , he said he knew best . But who 's going to be in trouble now ? Not Reinhart Golem , that 's for sure . No , it 's going to be my — '' Sergeant Winters interrupted him . `` Has the crime scene been secured ? '' he asked sharply , turning to the other police officers . `` Have you dusted for fingerprints ? '' Sergeant Johnson and Officer Hopkins admitted that they had n't . `` Let 's do this right , shall we ? '' asked Sergeant Winters . `` A crime of this magnitude needs to be handled with organization and correct police procedure . Sergeant Johnson , have you begun to fill out a report ? '' Sergeant Johnson shook his head . `` Not yet . I was just about to . '' He opened the car door and reached in for a clipboard that was sitting on the front passenger seat . `` Grandstanding as usual , '' he muttered . I knew he was talking about Sergeant Winters , but I was n't sure what he meant . Was it `` grandstanding '' to act as if you were the only person who knew how to do things right and to walk into the middle of an event and start criticizing everyone ? If so , I had to agree with Sergeant Johnson . Sergeant Winters was definitely grandstanding . Sergeant Johnson perched on the seat of his car and began to fill out a form . `` Has the owner of the house been contacted ? '' Sergeant Winters asked . `` Not yet , '' answered Officer Hopkins . `` I suggested that we do that , but Sergeant Johnson said to wait . '' `` Only until we returned to the car , '' said Sergeant Johnson , clearly exasperated . `` I said I 'd call when we were back at my radio . '' He frowned at Officer Hopkins , and I did too . Why was she trying to make him look bad in front of Officer Winters ? Jack Fenton stepped forward . `` I have a number for Reinhart Golem , '' he said . He held out a slip of paper he 'd taken from his wallet . `` I 've never even met the guy . He spends most of his time over in Europe or somewhere . But this is supposedly the number where he can be reached in an emergency . '' He handed the paper to Sergeant Johnson . Sergeant Johnson took it and reached for his cell phone . He punched in the number and waited . After a pause , he left a brief message with his name and phone number . `` No answer , '' he explained after he
