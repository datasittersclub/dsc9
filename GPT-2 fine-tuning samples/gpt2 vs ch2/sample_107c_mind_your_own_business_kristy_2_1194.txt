grief-stricken to be a good parent . But he put his foot down , brought his daughter home , and spent the next twelve years trying to be Superparent . He meant well , but he treated Mary Anne like a fragile little baby . As late as seventh grade she had to wear Pollyanna-type clothes and keep her hair in pigtails . Don ’ t worry , Richard grew up . Mary Anne is allowed to look her age . Nowadays she has a short hairstyle and wears neat , preppy-style clothes . ( Otherwise , she looks kind of like me — five feetish , with brown hair and brown eyes . ) Mary Anne has a stepfamily now , too . The BSC helped that happen . Awhile ago we took in a member named Dawn Schafer , who had moved to Stoneybrook from California with her divorced mom and younger brother , Jeff . Dawn ’ s mom had grown up in Stoneybrook , and guess who her high school sweetheart had been ? Richard Spier ! Mary Anne and Dawn reintroduced them , and — tsssss ! — the flame was still burning . Mr. Spier and Mrs. Schafer were married , and the Spier family moved into the Schafers ’ huge old farmhouse . Dawn and Mary Anne grew close , but Dawn became homesick for California and moved back to be with her dad . Jeff had done the same thing earlier , so now Mary Anne ’ s a solo kid again . She misses her stepsister a lot ( so do the rest of us ) , but Dawn is great about phoning and writing . She visits a lot , too — and when she does , Claudia makes sure to stock up on veggie chips and dried seaweed and other disgusting snacks . Dawn ’ s a health food fanatic . Claudia ’ s the opposite . Vice-president is the perfect position for her because she has a huge vice : junk food . She hides candy , cookies , chips , pretzels , and cupcakes all over her room . Her parents would faint if they knew . They are the Nutrition Police of Stoneybrook . ( Literature Police , too . Believe it or not , Claudia has to hide her Nancy Drew books because they ’ re not “ serious reading. ” ) How does a human sugar worshipper look ? Zit-free and gorgeous . I don ’ t understand it . Claudia could be a model . Let me be more specific . She looks like a thirteen-year-old Japanese-American model with long black hair , a constant smile , and weird clothes . What do I mean by weird ? Well , that Friday , for instance , she was wearing an old fringed leather vest she ’ d found in a thrift shop ; an oversize plaid shirt with a super-thick striped tie ; and bell-bottomed pants with two different-color legs . Her hair was pulled back with a hairclip in the shape of a VCR . Everyone complimented her on how cool she looked . Me ? I kept wanting to press the eject button to see if a teeny cassette would pop out of the hairclip . ( I should never have admitted that to Claudia . She calls me style-deficient . ) Claudia is one of a kind . Her artistic talent is amazing . She can paint , draw , sculpt , and make jewelry like a pro . The talent doesn ’ t carry over into schoolwork , though . I think the Art section of her brain is so huge that it swallowed up the Math , Spelling , and Science sections in one big gulp . She fell so far behind this year that she was sent back to seventh grade . Sigh . I miss having her in my classes , but at least she ’ s finally receiving good grades . And it ’ s great to see her confidence grow . The other Kishis are real brains ( especially her older sister , Janine the Genius ) , so Claudia needs all the self-confidence she can get . Her grandmother , Mimi , was the only one who really understood her . Ever since Mimi died , Claudia has kept a picture of her on her wall , for inspiration . Claudia ’ s other vice-presidential function ( besides supplying junk food ) is answering stray phone calls during non-meeting hours . Our treasurer is Stacey McGill . She collects dues every Monday and adds up all our funds . Stacey loves numbers . She happens to be the top math student in the state . ( It ’ s true . She won the title in a Mathletes competition . ) She also happens to be Claudia ’ s best friend . They like to talk fashion . Stacey doesn ’ t wear VCRs in her hair , though . She always looks as if she just stepped out of a Sassy or YM cover . Personally , I think she wears too much black , but she insists it “ sets off ” her blonde hair . Whatever . Stacey says that if I ’ d grown up in New York City like she did , I ’ d have a fashion sense , too . ( Which is sort of like saying that wombats could speak if they went to school . ) Stacey ’ s parents are divorced . They were still married back when the McGills first moved to Stoneybrook . They came here because Mr. McGill ’ s job had transferred him to Connecticut . Stacey settled in , joined the BSC , and whoosh — the company transferred Mr. McGill back to New York . Well , Stacey ’ s parents hadn ’ t been getting along , and all the moving pushed them over the edge . Next thing we knew , Stacey was back in Stoneybrook for good ,
