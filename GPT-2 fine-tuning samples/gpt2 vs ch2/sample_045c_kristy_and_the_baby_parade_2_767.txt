Mr. Spier actually loosened up so much that he started dating this woman who happened to be his old high-school sweetheart . She also happened to be the mother of one of our other club members , Dawn Schafer ! See , Dawn ’ s mom had grown up in Stoneybrook , but then she got married and moved to California . Years later , she got divorced , and she and Dawn ( and Dawn ’ s younger brother , Jeff ) moved back to Stoneybrook . And after she and Mr. Spier had dated for awhile , they decided to get married ! So Mary Anne ’ s other best friend , Dawn , is now also her stepsister . Mary Anne and her dad ( and her kitten , Tigger , too ) moved into Dawn ’ s house to live with Dawn and her mom . What about Jeff ? Well , he missed his dad — and California — so much that he moved back there . Now Dawn misses him , but she knows he made the right decision . I think Dawn ’ s happy here in Stoneybrook . I know she misses the sunny beaches and the more laid-back life-style of California , but she ’ s adjusted well to life in Connecticut . Dawn looks like my idea of a California girl , though . She ’ s a real knockout , with her blue eyes and her long , long , pale blonde hair . She ’ s got a style all her own , too — my friends and I call it “ California casual. ” She wears lots of cool clothes in bright colors . By the way , Dawn was always pretty , even as a little kid . She once told me that when she was two years old , her mom entered her picture in a baby contest — and she won first prize ! But Dawn ’ s not at all stuck-up . I don ’ t even think she has any idea how pretty she is . Dawn is — well , she ’ s mellow , that ’ s the only way I can describe her . She does her own thing , and doesn ’ t care much what other people think of her . I admire her for that . She ’ s been through some pretty rocky times — first her parents ’ divorce , and then her brother moving back to California , and then her mom ’ s remarriage . ( Even though Dawn and Mary Anne are best friends , it took some time for them to adjust to being in the same family . ) But she ’ s hung in there throughout all of it , even when the rest of us knew she must be hurting . One of Dawn ’ s favorite things about Stoneybrook is the house she lives in . Dawn loves to read ghost stories — so what could be better for her than living in a haunted house ? You might think I ’ m kidding , but I ’ m not . The house is really , really old , and it has a secret passage . We ’ re almost sure that a ghost lives there ! And if it does , maybe Dawn and Claudia can catch it . Claudia Kishi is another member of our club , and her favorite reading consists of Nancy Drew mysteries . She considers herself a pretty good detective . Claudia is just as gorgeous as Dawn , but in a totally different way . Instead of pale blonde hair , Claudia ’ s is jet-black . Instead of blue eyes , Claudia ’ s got beautiful brown almond-shaped ones . Claudia is Japanese-American — very exotic and very , very cool . If you want to talk about style , you ’ ve got to talk about Claudia Kishi . Nobody in Stoneybrook can put together a wild outfit like Claud can . She ’ s always up on the latest trend , whether it ’ s big black shoes , tie-dyed leggings , or cool hats . Her parents don ’ t mind the way she dresses ( though they ’ d probably draw the line if she wanted to dye her hair green or get a Mohawk or something ) because they know it ’ s all part of Claudia ’ s artistic sense , which they like to encourage . See , Claud ’ s not a great student — not because she ’ s dumb , but because she ’ s just not that interested in school . ( Her older sister , Janine , loves school — she ’ s a certified genius , so that would explain it . ) But Claudia ’ s less-than-average grades in English and math are balanced out by her above-average artistic talent . Painting , drawing , sculpting — you name it , Claudia ’ s terrific at it . You wouldn ’ t believe the beautiful things she ’ s made . She even makes her own jewelry sometimes — which just adds to her distinctive personal style . I mentioned that Claud ’ s parents encourage her artistic talent , but did I tell you how they feel about her passion for Nancy Drew books ? Well , they don ’ t exactly approve , so Claud has to hide her books . She ’ s good at hiding things , because she ’ s got another habit her parents disapprove of : eating junk food . Now , I like to have an occasional Twinkie as much as the next person , and I won ’ t turn down a Kit Kat bar . But Claudia is on another level of junk-food eating altogether . Security for Claud would be knowing that there are some M & M ’ s in her sock drawer , a pack of Yodels in her paint box , and a bag
