past the summer ( we are only allowed to sit at night , except for our families ) , Stacey has begun to wear more and more of Claudia 's clothes . In fact , it was Stacey who convinced us that she should become a fashion designer . Which , for Stacey seems a lot more sophisticated than the rest of us . I do n't understand that , because I do n't wear makeup and schoolwork are not my forte . I also do n't understand why our school is so overloaded with special interests . It may be that Stacey 's interest in fashion is something she does n't share . Fashion has only grown in Stacey 's commitment to it since she was born . ( Her mom , by the way , died a long time ago and Stacey does n't talk about it much . ) Maybe it 's something she 's learned over the years . Stacey , on the other hand , is an amazing athlete . She just had one big fat crash right after she was born , when she had a broken leg . No one knows exactly how she got that broken leg . Maybe her mom fell out of a lift ( I guess she fell across the steps ) , did n't pull down enough socks , or even put too much stock in her knees . Then her mom went crazy , inventing a new method of birth control called “ rescue pills ” that she claims can fix any kind of physical , emotional or emotional issue and not just this one : diabetes . Stacey has not only had to quit her job as an all-nighter , but she has had to replace one of her old friends ( he 's also an executive at a major company in New York ) — Shannon “ Schafer ” — who is also a former member . It can be a real struggle to convince her new boyfriend to become a baby again . Shannon is an only child . I think she ’ s only been coming to Stoneybrook for about one month now , but she looks like the baby for whom Stoneybrook is famous . Now , I ’ m sure there are a handful of kids in the eighth grade who aren ’ t going to break into our school record book anytime soon , but I don ’ t think Stoneybrook has ever , really been the envy of the world . Stacey ’ s dad walked out one morning when she was nine years old , leaving her mother to take care of her , well , baby . Her mom worked so hard to get her back together that it seemed like forever . And guess who her stepsister is ? Oh , good lord , he even remarried . The rest are all in the eighth grade , and Stacey came back to Stoneybrook with her mom in tow . Like with Mrs. Schafer and me , Jessi , Mal , and I are all thirteen and in the sixth grade . ( I lived right down the hall from Jessi and the others until the last time we met . ) We are eleven , which leaves just Jessi ( fifteen ) and me ( eight ) . As you can imagine , having only one sibling is nothing compared to having a whole lot of older ones in high places . There ’ s even more drama between brothers and sisters than between brothers and sisters . Here ’ s just one of the most complicated families I know : Mal ’ s family is as different from mine as you can imagine . Like mine , it ’ s just a little house . It ’ s built on top of an old farmhouse . ( It was built in 1795 . ) As you can see , Mal has an interesting family background . She has diabetes , which means her body can ’ t handle sugar . It ’ s a severe problem , and if you take too much of a punishment , you could end up with a heart attack or stroke . This has kept her healthy all her life . So while Claudia has great hair , she ’ s not a pretty face . That ’ s one important thing about Claud : She ’ s not afraid of what she has to wear ! She ’ s not afraid of her looks either . She can wear these stylish clothes that you might find at big companies like Macy ’ s or department stores like Stoneybrook Middle School . Her hair is as curly as Mallory ’ s , and she ’ s petite . Like Dawn , who wears shorter styles and has brown hair and brown eyes but is not as athletic as Claud ’ s . One thing you should know about Claud is that she ’ s addicted to health foods , and she ’ s only baby-sitting right now — not two weeks into seventh grade , when she ’ s going to have a full-term baby , and her health hasn ’ t been good . She even had a relapse way back in seventh grade . She wanted to try a lot of things , but none of them had worked . The next thing you know , you are on
