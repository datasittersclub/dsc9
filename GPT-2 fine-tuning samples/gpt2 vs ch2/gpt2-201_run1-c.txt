, but I just ca n't sit there and wait . Stacey must have made us up just so soon . It was about 5:15 with a big meeting to call on the phone . One of the main calls we received was a caller that she had left in with the other associate members , so we elected to call it one more time ( for two people , of course ) . A good way to handle this was just to call the meeting once more , but that was a pain in the ass , so Jessi and Shannon asked if they could join in the conversation . When they had no answer , they called after the meeting , and everybody went wild . I felt a little guilty since I 'm the club treasurer , but I was n't feeling bad . Besides , I 'd gotten my dues and I knew it was a good idea . ( We use dues to pay Charlie to drive up to the meeting to start work , and for expenses such as Kristy 's phone calls ) . Then we called it a day . We spent the first day deciding who would accept the job , and we decided who would want it , and after that we started trying to figure out exactly who would be part of the group . That afternoon , we began brainstorming to find a perfect club snack for it all , so I joined Kristy 's “ new people ” club . When we started brainstorming , we noticed that each person 's room was being watched — that they were being watched more than anyone in the room . We decided to start talking about it , too . One of us was trying out a new idea and having an actual positive impact on the club . We decided to help Claudia solve a problem she was making at her art class , and we decided to convince Claudia we had something to complain about . To that end , a meeting started up in Claudia 's room with all the members of our club , and we all went upstairs to try trying out different snack foods . We also decided that having a great idea was best left up to us . We called the meeting back to order , and after a minute of waiting , everyone packed . We went for the bagels , since they seemed too large . Kristy was sitting on our bed , trying not to wake everyone up with our huge snacks . We also made a point of looking around my room , trying to find a bowl of pretzels for the dog , the tortilla , the peaches , and the chips . Claud had made some of the junk food — chips , sugar , and pepperoni — from just sitting so the room emptied out . I had to admit that if I thought she was making up candy things , it was really , really gross . I did n't smell it . All around her , the room seemed packed full . I reached out for an apple as well as a pretzel wrapper and a pad of pretzels , all rolled up on Claudia 's bed . Our faces and faces turned blue . Then , suddenly , an idea hit Claudia . She wanted something special . She wanted something that could truly be enjoyed for years to come . Something that would bring new energy to the energy we all have in our lives today . I knew that . Kristy 's room had already changed ! We started thinking about all the pets we might replace . Then another . A third . The club also decided that Claudia 's family would be the first to be moved into the house . They needed a place to stay . We 'd decided this family would be okay , since they looked after us baby-sitters , Charlie Thomas and Jessica Ramsey , and Dawn Schafer , their younger sister . Then we 'd asked them to take a few pets into the house , but the club decided we wanted to keep a lot more pets , so Kristy suggested we just do the whole thing separately and do a few jobs at the same time . Kristy and I liked the idea , but not all members liked the idea . Well , we decided that a little help from Claudia , along with a new boyfriend , should help . That afternoon , Claudia turned toward us and offered the help . And I thought , what if we added the boyfriend ? I think we liked her idea , so I agreed . We hung up the phone . Claudia said , `` Thanks , I 'm not sure what I 'll do with them , but since you 're my first choice , I 'll help if you need anyone . '' Kristy looked at her , and she was thinking about joining us on the dance floor . `` You guys are a very good sport , '' Claudia said , holding up a poster of the new Stacey McGill-Brewer . `` You must be the best sport team I 've ever seen , '' Jessi continued , holding up a photo of a bunch of new players . `` And you should be the best athlete I 've ever seen , too , '' Stacey added . `` Me too , '' Claud began , putting the poster back in her book .
