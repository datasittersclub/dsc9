had no idea what shagging meant . I pictured her ripping the stuffing out of the ball and combing it into a seventies hairstyle . What ’ s Kristy like ? Short , loud , and bossy . Also reliable , strong , and consistent . Casual , too . She wears sweats , T-shirts , and sneaks all the time . Fashion , for Kristy , is … well , not a high priority . I ’ ve tried suggesting that Kristy put a little variety into her wardrobe . It ’ s like asking a tree to grow hair . I guess I can understand why she likes the predictability . Her life has been a roller coaster . Years ago , when Kristy lived across the street from me , her dad up and left the family . Kristy didn ’ t show much emotion ( except anger ) , but I know she was deeply hurt . Life became pretty rough , and Kristy worked hard to help her mom . Recently , Mrs. Thomas met and married a really nice guy named Watson Brewer , who happens to be a millionaire . For Kristy , it was like winning the lottery . Zoom , she and her family moved to Watson ’ s mansion across town . The Brewer/Thomases nearly fill up the place now . Start with Kristy ’ s mom , Watson , Kristy , and her three brothers . Then add Watson ’ s kids from his previous marriage , Karen and Andrew , who live there during alternate months . Kristy ’ s grandmother , Nannie , lives there year-round . She helps take care of Emily Michelle Brewer , Kristy ’ s little two-and-a-half-year-old adopted sister who was born in Vietnam . Throw in a puppy , a cat , and a few other pets , and you can picture what life is like there . Sort of like my room at 5:28 on a Monday . Crazy and crowded . As I picked up the last of the fallen marshmallows , the other BSC members began arriving with a flurry of hellos . Mary Anne Spier and Stacey McGill sat cross-legged on my bed . Mallory Pike and Jessi Ramsey plopped themselves down on the floor next to Abby . Kristy was now sitting in my canvas director ’ s chair , juggling marshmallows . “ Hey , I ’ m doing it ! ” she shouted . As my clock clicked to 5:30 , Kristy caught one of the flying marshmallows in her mouth . “ Doof mifftiff — ” She quickly chewed and swallowed . “ This meeting will come to order ! ” Kristy never — never — misses that 5:30 call . Reaching into her backpack , Stacey pulled out an old manila envelope . “ Dues day ! ” That reminded me of something . I reached behind my headboard for a hidden bag of candy . “ Pay Days ! ” The grumbling was canceled out by the cheers . Yes , we do have to pay dues out of our earnings . Some of the money helps pay for my phone bill . Kristy ’ s oldest brother , Charlie , gets a gas allowance for driving Kristy and Abby to meetings . And we always need a little cash for special events and for Kid-Kit items ( Kid-Kits are boxes of toys , books , games , and kid-friendly stuff , which we often take with us on our jobs ) . As you might have guessed , Stacey ’ s our treasurer . She is an absolute math whiz , who recently led the SMS Mathletes team to a state championship . Personally , I think growing up in New York City helped her . Have you ever asked a New Yorker how to find someplace ? Everything is measured in numbers : “ Go three stops on the Number One , switch to the uptown Three and take it to Ninety-sixth , walk two crossstown blocks and three downtown blocks to One Hundred Ten West Ninety-third … ” Numbers weren ’ t all Stacey picked up from the city . Her fashion sense is totally NYC , totally cutting-edge . She can practically smell what the year ’ s next hot outfits will be . I adore the way she dresses — sleek and urban , lots of black , which really sets off her blonde hair and fair skin . How did she end up in a nice suburban place like Stoneybrook ? Divorce . After her parents split , they gave her a choice : stay in NYC with her dad or move to Stoneybrook with her mom . Well , Stacey had already lived here for a while , when her dad ’ s company had transferred him to Connecticut temporarily . She had joined the BSC and made such fabulous friends , she just had to return . ( Boy , was I glad she did . Stacey and I are best friends . ) In one major way , Stacey and I are opposites : She can not eat sweets . Stacey has a condition called diabetes , which means her body goes seriously bonkers if she eats refined sugar . She could pass out or become terribly ill. Don ’ t worry , though . As long as she eats regular meals and gives herself daily injections of this stuff called insulin , she can lead a perfectly normal life . Okay , now that you know the club ’ s finances and eating habits , I ’ ll tell you about the O.P . ( Kristy-talk for “ Operating Procedure ” ) . When a parent calls during meeting hours , we take the information about the job and turn to our secretary , Mary Anne . She ’ s in charge of the record book . It contains a calendar , full of all our baby-sitting appointments and personal schedules — family events , doctor
