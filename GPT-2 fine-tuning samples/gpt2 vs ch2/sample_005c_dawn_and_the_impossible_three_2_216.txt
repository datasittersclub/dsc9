pleasure . I knew one reason Mary Anne was so happy about her father and my mother . It was because my mother took Mr. Spier ’ s mind off Mary Anne . Mr. Spier used to make all these rules for Mary Anne : She had to fix her hair in braids and wear the clothes he bought for her ; she couldn ’ t talk on the phone after dinner ; she had to be in by nine ; she had to put half of her baby-sitting money in the bank ; etc . etc . It was awful . He was already beginning to change when he “ re-met ” Mom , but now he ’ s a completely different father . He let Mary Anne get contact lenses to replace her reading glasses . He allows her to spend her baby-sitting money if she saves her allowance , and since he no longer buys her clothes , you should see what Mary Anne gets with her money . She doesn ’ t look like Claudia or Stacey , who wear these really wild outfits such as tight black pants and Day-Glo shirts , but , well , for instance , at that very moment as we walked across the Kishis ’ lawn , Mary Anne had on her first sweatshirt and her first pair of jeans ever . She looked terrific ! “ You know what I ’ m going to start doing ? ” Mary Anne asked me with a giant grin . “ What ? ” “ Redecorating my room. ” “ No ! Really ? ” “ Really . I used to think that the only way I ’ d be able to redecorate was if my father lost his mind . I guess he did lose it — over your mother. ” “ Thanks a lot ! ” I said . “ Oh , you know what I mean . I think it ’ s great. ” “ Great that he and Mom are going out , or great that he ’ s lost his mind ? ” Mary Anne giggled . “ Both , ” she said . “ What are you going to do to your room ? ” “ I ’ m going to take all the babyish stuff off my walls and put up posters and photographs . That ’ s all I can afford to do . Then I ’ ll have to work on my dad a little . I have to see if he ’ ll help me do anything expensive . I want a new bedspread and a new rug and new curtains and new wallpaper . Everything in my room is pink , and I can ’ t stand pink ! ” We reached the Kishis ’ front stoop . I rang the bell . Claudia ’ s sister Janine answered the door . Mary Anne and I glanced at each other . Janine is fifteen years old . She ’ s a genius . Mary Anne and Kristy don ’ t like her because she ’ s so smart , and she ’ s always correcting whatever they say . But I don ’ t mind Janine . I think she ’ s all right . You just have to know how to handle her . “ Hi , Janine ! ” I said . Mary Anne hung back . She ’ s shy around some people . “ Hi , ” Janine answered . “ I suppose you ’ re here for a meeting of your club. ” “ Yup , ” I said . “ You know , ” Janine began , “ the expression ‘ yup ’ — ” “ Janine , ” I interrupted her , “ did you notice Mary Anne ’ s clothes ? She has new jeans and a new sweatshirt . She bought them with her own money — money she earned baby-sitting. ” “ The club must be doing awfully well , ” Janine commented . “ Oh , it is . Extremely well. ” I decided to toss out a few big words . “ Thanks to the foresight of our president , it ’ s both profitable and proficient … profusely proficient , ” I added . “ Well , we must continue on. ” We ran past Janine and up the stairs , but I could hear Janine yell after us , “ ‘ Continue on ’ is redundant ! ” I didn ’ t know what redundant meant , and I didn ’ t care . We entered Claudia ’ s room . Claudia was sitting cross-legged on her bed while her grandmother , Mimi , brushed her hair . Claudia ’ s hair is absolutely beautiful . It ’ s long and jet-black and always shiny . She uses special stuff in it . Claudia and Stacey have suddenly taken great interest in their hair . One night a week they muck it up with an egg rinse . On Wednesdays and Sundays they squeeze lemon juice on it — from real lemons . They keep telling me I should use eggs and lemons in my hair , too . I have long , l-o-n-g hair ( almost down to my bottom ) . It ’ s thin and fine , and so blonde it ’ s white . Mom says it ’ s like corn silk . Claudia says the egg would give it body . Stacey says the lemon would make it shiny . I say it ’ s my hair and what I do with it is my business . ( I plan to try an avocado paste on it . If Claudia and Stacey and I put our heads together , we ’ d have a salad . ) “ Hello , girls , ” Mimi greeted us in her gentle accent . “ Is it time for your meeting ? ” “ Yes , ” Mary Anne replied , leaning over to kiss Mimi on the cheek
