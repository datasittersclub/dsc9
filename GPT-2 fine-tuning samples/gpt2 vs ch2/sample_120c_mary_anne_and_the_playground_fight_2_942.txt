decided I 'd better talk to my friends in the BSC about Victoria at the meeting . Which reminded me , it was almost time to leave . Kristy , our president , hates when anyone is late . She 's almost as bad as my dad that way . * * * '' This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club will come to order , '' Kristy said twenty minutes later , while looking at the clock . It was five-thirty sharp . She sat in a director 's chair , the same chair she commandeered at every meeting , and looked at us from under the visor of her baseball cap , the same cap she wore to every meeting . The Baby-sitters Club meets every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday afternoon from five-thirty to six in Claudia Kishi 's room . And why is Claudia 's room our official headquarters ? For two good reasons . One , Claudia has her own private phone line so clients can call us during meetings ( our business hours ) to request sitting jobs . And two , Claudia always keeps a generous supply of munchies on hand in case we 're hungry , which we always are . At this very moment , Abby Stevenson , Jessica Ramsey , and Mallory Pike were on the rug by Claudia 's bed , gorging on potato chips . Kristy was holding a chocolate Ring-Ding in one hand . I was swallowing a fistful of M & M 's . And Stacey McGill , who is not allowed to eat sugary food , was munching on a carrot stick . `` Let 's take care of dues first , '' Kristy said . We groaned . We pay dues every Monday , and we always groan about it . We use the money for club expenses , which include our snacks , gas money for Kristy 's brother Charlie who drives her and Abby to the meetings , and items for the Kid-Kits . Kid-Kits are special boxes filled with games , puzzles , books , crayons , glitter pens , and whatever else we think would be fun for our baby-sitting charges . We do n't bring the kits to every job , but they do come in handy when we have new clients , or when we think a job is going to be challenging ( because a kid is sick or has to stay indoors because of the weather , for example ) . The Kid-Kits were Kristy 's brainstorm . Which makes sense . She 's the one who came up with the idea for the Baby-sitters Club in the first place . Kristy thought up the BSC one night while listening to her mother make phone call after phone call trying to find a sitter for Kristy 's little brother , David Michael . Kristy thought , What if a person could call one number and reach several sitters at once ? For Kristy , having an idea is the same as acting on it . In no time at all , she had rounded up three friends : me , Claudia , and Stacey . The Baby-sitters Club was launched ... and the rest is history , in Stoneybrook , at least . It 's hard to believe there were once only four people in the BSC . Since then , we have more than doubled in size . Now we have seven full-time members , two associate members to handle overflow business , and one long-distance , honorary member in California â€” Dawn . We do n't need to hand out fliers or put up signs around town anymore . We have more than enough business from satisfied clients and from people to whom we 've been recommended . In order to keep things organized , we have a record book . That 's where I come in . I am the club secretary . I keep track of all our schedules and all our jobs , as well as important information about each charge ( such as allergies and other medical conditions ) . We also have a BSC notebook in which we write about our jobs . A lot of members think the notebook is a big pain because it 's like homework , but I really enjoy writing in it . The notebook helps keep us up-to-date on what 's happening with our baby-sitting charges . Also , we can look at past entries to help us solve baby-sitting problems . Chances are , whatever the situation , one of us has seen it before and has written it up in the notebook . The BSC is successful because we 're organized , reliable , and have good ideas ( such as the notebook and Kid-Kits ) , and because the members are very different from one another , yet work well together . To begin , there 's Kristy , our super-organized and daring president . These are excellent qualities for running the BSC , I think . They also come in handy in Kristy 's large , noisy family . Like me , Kristy is part of a blended family . Hers , however , is a much bigger one than mine . You would not believe all the people who live in Kristy 's house : one mother , one stepfather , one grandmother , two older brothers , one younger brother , one adopted younger sister , and ( when they 're not living alternate months with their mother ) one younger stepsister and one younger stepbrother , plus assorted pets . Luckily , Kristy lives in a mansion , so there 's plenty of room for everyone . ( Her stepfather , Watson Brewer , is a millionaire as well as a really great guy . ) Claudia , our vice-president , graciously hosts all the meetings . She was under her bed at the moment , frantically searching for her wallet . `` I know I left it in my
