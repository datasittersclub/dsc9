and a pinch of intimidation . Or maybe you could call it plain old bossiness . When I first met Kristy , that bossiness really got on my nerves . Who did this little squirt ( she 's the shortest girl in our class ) think she was , telling me what to do ? Slowly , though , I saw things in Kristy I had n't seen initially . For instance , she cares so much about people that when she comes up with a project to help them , she 'll move mountains to accomplish it . She has no patience for anything that stands in her way . Which is why she might sometimes seem blunt or even insensitive . But she gets things done . I gained more respect for her when I learned a little about her family background . At first I thought Kristy was just this rich kid living in a mansion with all her happy brothers and sisters . I assumed everything had just been handed to her . That was n't true . Kristy , her mother , and her three brothers had been through some hard times . Their father deserted them shortly after David Michael , Kristy 's younger brother , was born . ( What a creep ! ) Their mother had to struggle to support them all . She did it , though . They were already on a pretty even keel when she met Watson Brewer , who became Kristy 's stepdad . Watson just happens to be megarich . When he married Mrs. Thomas , Kristy and her family moved across town to the neighborhood where I live and where Watson 's mansion is located . The household now includes Kristy 's adopted sister , Emily Michelle , who is about two and a half . ( Watson and Kristy 's mom adopted her from Vietnam . ) Plus Karen , who 's seven , and Andrew , who 's four . They 're Watson 's kids from his first marriage , and they live there every other month ( the remaining time , they 're with their mother ) . Mrs . Brewer 's mother , whom everybody calls Nannie , lives there too . So you can see Kristy has had lots of adjusting to do . Maybe it 's because of all I 've been through with my dad 's death that I admire people who can roll with the punches ( as the saying goes ) . Next , let me tell you about Mary Anne Spier . She and Kristy are very close . They grew up together . They were next-door neighbors before Kristy moved . They are both petite , with brown hair and eyes , but they 're very different . While Kristy is a talker , Mary Anne is a listener . She 's quiet and sensitive . She has n't had an easy life either . Her mother died when Mary Anne was a baby . For a while she lived with her grandparents . Then her father took her back and raised her . I hear he was super-strict and had a million rules for everything , including what Mary Anne could wear . ( I 've seen photos of her in seventh grade . She was dressed in pleated skirts and wore braids . The pits ! ) Mary Anne was the first baby-sitter to befriend Dawn Schafer when she moved to Stoneybrook . They did n't appear to be a natural match . Dawn is tall and breezy , with long blonde hair and a nice casual style . She 's not quiet like Mary Anne . She 's quick to speak up , especially when she cares about something , such as an environmental issue . Nonetheless , they became friends and that changed their lives . Dawn had come to Stoneybrook from California because her parents had recently divorced . Her mother was originally from Stoneybrook and was returning home . One day , Dawn and Mary Anne were looking through Mrs. Schafer 's old high school year-book when they discovered that she and Mary Anne 's dad , Richard , had been a couple in high school . They hatched a plan to get the two of them back together , and — believe it or not — it worked . Mary Anne and Dawn were soon stepsisters . Then the big shocker came . Dawn decided she missed California and wanted to live with her brother , father , and stepmother . A major bummer for Mary Anne and a problem for the BSC , who now had to replace Dawn . Luckily , a fabulous new girl with wit , charm , and leadership ability had just moved into town from Long Island , and was able to replace her . ( Just kidding ! Sort of . ) Dawn comes back to visit sometimes and always attends meetings when she 's here . She 's the honorary member I mentioned . In fact , she 's been here and coming to meetings all this summer . Although , she was n't at this meeting because she had a back-to-school doctor 's checkup . ( I could n't believe school was only a few weeks away ! ) I 'm not the only replacement member , of course . Jessi and Mallory , as I said , replaced Stacey when she moved back to New York City . Stacey , who is pretty , with blue eyes and permed blonde hair , was born in Manhattan . When she was in seventh grade , her father was transferred to Stoneybrook . Then , after Stacey had become a club member , his company transferred him back . ( That 's when Jessi and Mallory joined . ) But once the McGills were back in Manhattan , Stacey 's parents decided to divorce . So Stacey returned to Stoneybrook with her mother and resumed her place in the club . I feel
