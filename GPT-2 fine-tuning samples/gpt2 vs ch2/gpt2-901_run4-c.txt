an entire column devoted to her . She ’ s the only club member who would rather eat junk food than watch her parents ’ back up their mouth — except for Claudia and Stacey . Speaking of pretzels , Claudia is pretty gross about hers . She practically has to suck on a container of something called “ Duck Sauce. ” If she didn ’ t , someone would have to hear her say it . That ’ s probably because she doesn ’ t eat well . She has a strict diet , and I think she ’ ll be fine . But there are other things she can hide . She ’ s kind of quiet and shy , and she doesn ’ t speak much when I ’ m asking her about her “ dinner conversation or anything. ” She ’ s kind of sensitively________________________� , too , and she trusts me when I ’ m asking her about things , too . ( That ’ s what I meant about my friends : romantic kisses for me sometimes ; tender feelings for me ; big talk for me sometimes ; and the kind of sentimental talk that gets you a certain level of trust in someone , if you don ’ t already know them better than you do . ) When I think about all the people and occasions when I or we became friends , I just barely had time to think of all these things. < |endoftext| > '' Well , it ’ s two days , I guess , '' sang Kristy . `` Happily ever after . '' We got off the train at the Pikes ’ and headed straight for the Empire State Building . ( We arrive on time , in case there is a rush . We always do . ) We stopped at a red brick door , onto which we stuck a photo I ’ d taken while looking through my brother ’ s toothpaste . My eyes widened . Kristy was standing at the doorway , wearing her uniform : red slickers ; blue slickers ; green slickers ; and … “ Oh , wait a second ! ” Kristy interrupted us . `` Mary Anne Spier Fonda ? Are you not supposed to be going to the Academy ? ” asked a voice outside the door . I saw Kristy stare at her , fascinated . Then I realized how serious I was . ( Be careful what you wish for . This is best . ) “ The door is unlocked , ” repeated Kristy . Claudia took the photo and put it in her briefcase . Then she and all the other BSC members entered . Stacey followed suit , choosing the closest red-and-white-striped dressing room from Selma . “ I have a big dream coming up , ” she said , clearing her throat . “ I heard that Hollywood is turning into a slum and they finally began taking down their associate members , ” said Claudia . “ Oh , it is turning out like a big dream , ” I said . Dawn Schafer , who had been second in command , looked less impressed . “ I can dream , ” said Kristy nonchalantly , pulling a vase from her dresser drawer . “ Sounds like a big dream to me , too , ” said Mary Anne . “ Sounds like a big nightmare , too , ” said Abby . I gave in and took a drag of my coffee . Just to make me even more nervous , Kristy led me through the stairs a little ways down the block . I landed on the second row of seats near the big red-and-white-striped gym chair . Behind me , near Claudia and just behind Mary Anne , was Abby . Kristy was sitting in her usual spot , an armchair , but this time , next to Mary Anne , she was facing her . Sitting up made her look even more attractive . She held up two fingers and announced , “ Hold that finger , that ’ s for me . May I borrow your nose , for a try . Or may I lend your foot , for a try. ” As Kristy pointed out all those attractive terms , Claudia picked up the nose and foot . “ Oops , that ’ s how my nose sounds , ” she explained with a smile . “ It sounds better if you don ’ t bring your nose and fingers. ” “ I like my nose so much , ” said Mary Anne , who had been the only one in the group to have one of Kristy ’ s earrings . Kristy gave Abby ’ s the big nose-nose experiment , too . At the beginning of my try , I didn ’ t want my thumb to come out of the hole in my ear . But then , most people think your thumb is a little crooked . The hole is just
