brown eyes , and she ’ s short for her age . She ’ s kind of a tomboy : Kristy loves sports , especially baseball . And she doesn ’ t care much about clothes and makeup and all that . She wears nearly the same thing every day : jeans , a turtleneck , and running shoes . Kristy has a big family , and it ’ s much more complicated than mine . She has two older brothers and one younger one , plus a stepfather and his kids — a boy and a girl — from his first marriage . ( Her stepbrother and stepsister don ’ t live with Kristy all the time , though . Most of the time they ’ re with their mom . ) Also , her mom and stepdad adopted a little girl , so Kristy has a two-year-old sister , too . Plus , her grandmother lives with the family . It ’ s a full house , but luckily Kristy ’ s stepdad ( whose name is Watson Brewer ) is a millionaire — honest ! — and their house is actually a mansion . That ’ s Kristy . Now , more about the club she organized . I ’ m the vice-president . Why ? Well , mainly because we meet in my room and use my private phone line for our business . I guess I don ’ t have any real duties , unless you count supplying Ring-Dings and Ruffles . Oh , and I also take care of any business calls that come in during times when we ’ re not meeting . Mary Anne Spier is our secretary . She ’ s Kristy ’ s best friend , even though they are very different people . I think the only thing they have in common may be their looks : Mary Anne also has brown hair and eyes , and is small for her age . But while Kristy is outgoing , Mary Anne is more of a mouse . She ’ s shy , and quiet , and very sensitive . Everybody loves Mary Anne , because she ’ s a good listener and a good friend . She ’ s not very sophisticated , but in a way she ’ s more mature than she seems . For example , she ’ s the only one in the club who has a steady boyfriend ! Also , she ’ s very dependable , which is important for the club . As secretary , she takes care of a lot of little details . She keeps our record book up-to-date with all kinds of information about our clients . She also keeps track of everyone ’ s schedule , so when a call comes in she always knows — at a glance — who ’ s available . Mary Anne ’ s mom died a long , long time ago , and Mary Anne grew up with just her father . I know life wasn ’ t always easy for Mary Anne or her father . But now Mary Anne has a new stepmom , and a new stepsister and -brother . More about that later . Our club ’ s treasurer is Stacey McGill , who happens to be my best friend . Stacey is cool . Very cool . She grew up in New York City , and I think she ’ s more sophisticated than anyone else in Stoneybrook . Her outfits are always awesome , and she perms her blonde hair and wears makeup that brings out her big blue eyes . Stacey ’ s parents got divorced not too long ago , and her dad lives in New York . Stacey visits him as often as she can , but I think she ’ s glad she decided to live in Stoneybrook with her mom . ( Boy , would I hate to have had to make that kind of decision ! ) I think Stacey has a really good relationship with her mother . Mrs. McGill used to baby Stacey , because Stacey has diabetes . But by now Stacey has proved that she is mature enough to take care of herself . Diabetes is no joke . It ’ s a serious disease , and Stacey will always have it . It has to do with blood sugar ; I ’ ve never entirely understood the scientific explanation , but I know that Stacey has to be very careful about what she eats . No sweets . ( That would be a total nightmare for me . ) Also , she has to give herself a shot every single day . That ’ s because her body doesn ’ t produce the right amount of this stuff which I forget the name of . Anyway , Stacey ’ s very accepting about having diabetes , even though it sometimes makes her really , really sick . As treasurer of our club , Stacey ’ s main job is to collect dues every Monday . She sometimes has to pry the money out of us , since we all hate to part with our hard-earned cash . She also keeps track of how much money is in the treasury . This is a snap for Stacey . She loves math . ( Gag me ! ) We use the dues money for a lot of different things . For example , we pay Kristy ’ s brother to drive her to meetings , since Watson ’ s mansion is way across town . ( Kristy used to live across the street from me . ) And some of the money goes for supplies for our Kid-Kits . Kid-Kits are another of Kristy ’ s great ideas . They ’ re these boxes we ’ ve decorated to look cool , and they ’ re full of stuff that kids love : games and puzzles and stickers and books . We bring them on jobs , and they ’ re
