associate . Once in a while he comes to a meeting , but often not . Now , I ’ m back in the club ( obviously ) but Stacey is out . Her leaving was really awful because she left on bad terms . She became super involved with her boyfriend , Robert , and his friends , and seemed less and less interested in her BSC duties and friendships . Finally , the situation blew up into a big argument , ending with Stacey quitting and Kristy firing her . So , that ’ s a brief history of the BSC . Here ’ s how the club works . We meet between 5:30 and 6:00 every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday in Claudia ’ s room . As I said , she has her own phone number , so we don ’ t have to tie up anyone ’ s family phone . Parents call us during our meetings . Whoever is closest to the phone answers any call that comes in , takes the information , then tells the client she ’ ll call right back . Mary Anne takes out the club record book and checks to see who is free to handle the job . When that ’ s decided , we call back the client and confirm the job . All of us ( except Mal and Jessi , because they ’ re younger ) have official positions . Kristy is the president since the club was her idea . Also , she ’ s very organized and always full of new ideas . For example , the record book was her idea . Not only does it contain baby-sitting appointments , it holds everyone ’ s other commitments such as Mal ’ s orthodontist appointments , Jessi ’ s dance lessons , Claudia ’ s art classes , and so forth . That way , there ’ s never a conflict in schedules . The book also contains information on our clients — names , phone numbers , allergies , special rules . It tells how much each client pays , and anything else we might need to know . Another Kristy idea is the club notebook . After each of us completes a sitting job , we have to write about it in the notebook . Sometimes this is a pain , but it ’ s very helpful . If you haven ’ t sat for a particular family before , or not in a long while , you can just turn to the notebook and find out about the family . That way if some little kid is afraid of something such as , say , the toilet flushing , you know that before you even arrive at the house . Yet another stroke of Kristy genius is Kid-Kits . They ’ re boxes crammed with fun stuff for kids to do . Kid-Kits contain coloring books , storybooks , crayons , toys , glitter , face paints , stamps , stickers , and whatever else we can think of . ( We ’ re constantly restocking them with new , fun things . ) We don ’ t bring the Kid-Kits to every single job because we want them to be a surprise treat . But if one of us knows she ’ s going into a difficult job ( a sick kid , for instance , or one who doesn ’ t want to be left with a sitter ) they can be real life-savers . Our vice-president is Claudia . She doesn ’ t have any official duties , but we use her room and her phone for the meetings . She also supplies snacks . So it seems only fair she should be the vice-president . Mary Anne is the club secretary . She does a lot of work . It isn ’ t easy keeping that record book straight , and making sure everyone gets a fair turn , and scheduling the work at the right times , but she does a fantastic job . Until recently , Stacey was our treasurer . That meant she collected our dues every week . No one likes paying up , but we need the money for several things . We help Claudia pay her phone bill . We pay Kristy ’ s big brother , Charlie , to drive Kristy and Shannon to meetings . We pay for the stuff that goes into our Kid-Kits . And , if there ’ s anything left over , we occasionally do something fun such as have a sleepover or a pizza party . Stacey is a whiz in math , so she was the natural one for that job . While she was away the first time , I got stuck with the treasurer job . Now that she ’ s out of the club , I ’ m the treasurer again and Shannon is the alternate officer . As the alternate officer , Shannon fills in for anyone who can ’ t make a meeting . Most of the time it ’ s easy since no one misses meetings much . But when she ’ s needed Shannon has to be ready to jump in . I suppose I should tell you a little about each of the members . I ’ ll start with Kristy . She ’ s short with medium-length brown hair and brown eyes . She ’ s very athletic and even coaches a kids ’ softball team called Kristy ’ s Krushers . She ’ s a sporty dresser who cares more about comfort than fashion . Some people might call Kristy bossy because , well … she is . She knows what she wants done and isn ’ t shy about expressing herself . But I value her leadership qualities . Without Kristy ’ s commitment and strictness the club wouldn ’ t run half as well as it does . ( Believe me . When I was in California I was part of baby-sitting
