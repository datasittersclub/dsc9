rode her great blue eyes and wore a nice , trendy , trendy dress ( mostly purple and pink ) with very little-girl jewelry in the shape of sequins , buckles , bows , and ankle boots . And I bet you 've already told me this . I know she would probably be thrilled , but she ’ s probably not . She ’ s not a romantic . She ’ s outgoing and gets along well with boys . Like I said , she ’ s an only child . And even though she ’ s a great baby-sitter , I wouldn ’ t bet against her a little one way or the other . She could be a pretty good one-way cop sometimes . How does she handle her new finds and new friends ? Well , she can be extremely strict . You might even say that she ’ d get a heart attack just the way she ’ d be starved for one . Maybe it was that early in life that she ’ d become obsessed with appearance . And she lived with her mom ( her dad died when she was nine ) and her eight brothers ( she still has three younger brothers ) . She is the oldest of eight , and the only child of her stepfather . How did she meet Mr. and Mrs. McGill ? Simple . She met Mary Anne , her stepsister , when she was in Stoneybrook high school . She met them , too , though , and they fell in love again and got married . That was when they moved into the house where they ’ d all grown-up . They didn ’ t live too far away yet , so they invited me to become permanent resident . I said I would live in their side of town , so they moved me back to their neighborhood . Mr. and Mrs. McGill lived right next door to me all the time , and he lived across the street away from me . ( He ’ d probably move back into his neighborhood . Mary Anne ’ s cousin , who has since moved in , is the only one who truly misses her . ) So that ’ s my complete group of friends . ( They ’ re called “ Claudia ” because I am the only member who really cares about my health . ) We had some bad experiences at the meetings when we found out we ’ d have to turn away too many of our regular members . One of the bad things was that some of our oldest club members didn ’ t seem to like Mal . Maybe she thought I was cute and strange and loud and involved too much drama in our lives . Maybe she ’ d been too patient , because we ’ ve all grown-up a little bit lately . Another thing that happened while we tried to convince everyone that we were getting a long-term solution to a problem was that Mrs. McGill hated red meat . Then another bad idea happened . Her new stepdad and stepbrother decided to get a control freak . They married at the same time — and Mary Anne became the first member of the Baby-sitters Club . Mary Anne is the sweetest person I know . She cries at the worst possible times . She even went through a hard time getting by in seventh grade , when her father made her drop out of eighth grade entirely . Her mother died when Mary Anne was a baby . For a long time she lived with her grandparents because her parents wanted to raise her just for herself . But at the same time , she has grown up and she still hears about me and her dad and I ( well , I guess I do now ) . One thing that rarely comes to Mary Anne is the nagging nagging at the end of a long car ride home that she never thinks she ’ s ever will . She ’ s stubborn , but she doesn ’ t let it get to her . She ’ s more organized than I am , just like me , and she knows that now . Mary Anne has brown hair and brown eyes and a family of four brothers and sisters . She ’ s a stickler for rules . Mom tries to take care of the boys well , even though she ’ s been through some tough times . She does all the hard work — paying dues , telling friends about her new talent , scheming her way through school , getting a BSC photo ID , all kinds of assorted little things . Mary Anne has absolutely pulled her strength and determination into everything she does , even though she has brothers and sisters who are identical triplets . Mary Anne can be a bit of a prick sometimes , I guess , but she ’ s never any kind of physical problem — she ’ s a librarian and she knows exactly what she ’ s doing . And so her father works hard for part of his salary on personal service . The way he runs the household is a little chaotic , with lots of rules going on and rules falling ( that is , when you ’ re not the boss ) . But that ’ s the
