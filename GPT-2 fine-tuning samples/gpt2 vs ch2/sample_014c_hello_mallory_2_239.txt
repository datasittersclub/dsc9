white tights with little red hearts all over them . “ You look like a Valentine , ” Vanessa told me , but I didn ’ t care . I put on my penny loafers . “ Mallory ! ” said Mom as I sat down at the breakfast table a little while later . “ You look lovely… . This isn ’ t school-picture day , is it ? ” she added , glancing suspiciously at my brothers and sisters . They certainly were not dressed in their best clothes . “ No , Mom . Don ’ t worry , ” I told her . “ I ’ m going to the Baby-sitters Club meeting , remember ? ” “ Oh , that ’ s right . Well , have fun. ” Have fun , I thought . Sure . I was as jumpy as a cat . When I got to Stoneybrook Middle School that morning I looked around for Kristy , Dawn , Mary Anne , and Claudia . I thought that if I saw them , I could just walk up to them , as cool as anything , and say , “ Hi , you guys . How is everything ? Can ’ t wait for the meeting. ” I could pretend I was a big eighth-grader instead of a twerpy sixth-grader . But the sixth-grade wing is at the opposite end of the building from the eighth-grade wing . There was no chance I ’ d see them unless I took a little walk . I pretended I needed to go to the library , which is near the eighth-grade wing . As I wandered through the halls , I looked and looked for the girls , but I didn ’ t see them . Not in the library , not outside the cafeteria , not hanging around the gym . I was still only halfway back to my homeroom when the bell rang . The bell ! I ’ d been fooling around longer than I thought . I tore through the halls to my classroom and darted through the door just before Mrs. Frederickson closed it . I was the last to arrive and slid into my seat between bossy Benny Ott and Rachel Robinson . ( Mrs. Frederickson seats us alphabetically . ) Wait a second . I wasn ’ t between Benny and Rachel . I was between Benny and some girl I ’ d never seen before . Rachel was one seat away from me . What was wrong ? I checked my desk . Yup . It was the one I always sit at , with the big E.L. carved in an upper corner and the heart carved in a lower one . I took another look at the girl sitting next to me . My eyes widened . For one thing , the girl was beautiful . She was long-legged and thin , and even sitting down she appeared graceful . Also , she was black . There were no black students in our entire grade . This new girl would be the only one . In fact , there are only about six black kids in the whole school . They ’ re in the seventh and eighth grades . Wow . This was pretty interesting . “ Class , ” Mrs. Frederickson said , rapping on her desk with a pencil . “ Good morning . As you ’ ve probably noticed , we have a new student . Her name is Jessica Ramsey . Our seating has changed a bit to make room for her . Jessica is sitting at Rachel Robinson ’ s old desk , and Rachel and everyone after her have moved over one seat. ” I saw Rachel cross her eyes at Jessica , tilt her head to the side , and stick her tongue out . If Jessica noticed , she didn ’ t pay attention . She just kept looking straight ahead at Mrs. Frederickson . Why , I wondered , did Rachel care about her desk so much ? We only sit at these desks during homeroom . We don ’ t even keep stuff in them , since other classes use them the rest of the day . “ I hope , ” Mrs. Frederickson went on , “ that you will make Jessica feel welcome. ” Mrs. Frederickson sounded sincere , but I noticed that she didn ’ t ask Jessica to stand up and introduce herself and tell us where she had come from . That was what she had done when Benny Ott was new . From day one , we ’ d known that Benny was from Detroit , and that his dad sold car parts and his mom was a secretary and Benny hoped to become a great actor . Jessica Ramsey sat next to me , a mystery . I kept looking at her long legs . Maybe she was a dancer or a gymnast or something . Of course , I looked at her face , too . Jessica ’ s eyes were huge and dark . Her lashes were so long I wondered if they were fake . Probably not , if her mother was anything like mine , and I decided that was a distinct possibility , since Jessica wore glasses and didn ’ t have pierced ears , either . I wondered what being the only black student in your grade would feel like . I guessed it would feel no different from being the only anything in your grade . I was the only one in our grade with seven brothers and sisters , including ten-year-old triplets . But I knew that wasn ’ t quite the same . The kids couldn ’ t tell that just by looking at me . But Jessica ’ s coffee-colored skin was there for the world to see . However , I didn ’ t think nearly as much about Jessica ’ s skin as I did about the fact that
