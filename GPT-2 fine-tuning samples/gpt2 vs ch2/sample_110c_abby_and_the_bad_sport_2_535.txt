a weird dislike of peanut butter , for example , or who ’ s struggling to learn how to ride a bicycle . We can also use it for help in solving baby-sitting problems . Chances are , whatever the situation , one of us has encountered it before and written about it in the notebook . The BSC is a success because we are organized , reliable , and have good ideas ( like the Kid-Kits ) , and because we are all so very different from one another , in spite of the fact that there are three sets of best friends , plus one couple , in our club . Take Kristy . Please . ( That ’ s a joke . Kristy and I get along fine , but she is so stubborn . I mean , she actually argues with me ! ) You already know that Kristy is our president , the idea queen of the world . In addition to running the BSC , she also coaches Kristy ’ s Krushers , a softball team for kids who are too young or otherwise not ready for Little League ( average age of a team member : approximately 5.8 years old ) . She is also best friends with Mary Anne , even though they couldn ’ t be more different . They are both short , true . Kristy is the shortest person in our class and Mary Anne isn ’ t much taller . They both have brown hair and are members of blended families . They both dress casually , although Mary Anne ’ s style is a little more fashionably preppy . Kristy is outspoken , opinionated , and , according to some people , pushy . ( Isn ’ t it interesting that people call someone who can ’ t be bullied or pushed around pushy ? ) These are excellent qualities for organizing and running the BSC ( and probably the world , someday ) . They also come in very handy in a large , noisy family . Kristy lives with two older brothers , one younger brother , and , part-time , when they are not living with their mother , one younger stepsister and one younger stepbrother . She also lives with one very young adopted sister , one mother , one stepfather , one grandmother , one dog , one cranky cat , assorted other pets , and , according to a few members of her family , particularly her very imaginative stepsister , Karen , one resident ghost . Fortunately , Kristy ’ s stepfather , Watson Brewer , is a real , live millionaire ( as well as a nice guy , a good cook , and an avid gardener ) , which is quite a switch from the old days when Kristy and her mother and brothers had to struggle to make ends meet . When Watson and Kristy ’ s mother got married , the family moved into a real , live mansion . That means plenty of room for everybody , including the ghost . Mary Anne Spier also comes from a blended family . It is much smaller , however . Mary Anne ’ s mother died when Mary Anne was just a baby . That left Mary Anne ’ s father in charge of her upbringing . He , in turn , was very strict and protective of Mary Anne . That ’ s cool , except that it was hard for Mr. Spier to realize that Mary Anne was growing up . Until recently he made her wear pigtails and even picked out the ( little-girl ) clothes she wore . Unlike Kristy , Mary Anne is very quiet and very shy and sensitive ( she even cries at sentimental commercials ) . But she is as stubborn in her own way as Kristy is . She finally convinced her father that she was old enough to do some things on her own , such as choose her own clothes . When Mr. Spier saw that Mary Anne could handle more responsibility , he relaxed and gave her a little more freedom . She got a kitten , which she named Tigger , and a boyfriend . ( You ’ ll hear about him later , since he is an associate member of the BSC . ) Mary Anne also got a whole new stepfamily when her father married his former high school sweetheart — thanks in part to Mary Anne and her stepsister-to-be , Dawn Schafer . Mary Anne and Dawn had become best friends ( yes , Mary Anne has two best friends ) shortly after Dawn moved to Stoneybrook from California with her mother and brother after her parents got divorced . Dawn ’ s mother had grown up in Stoneybrook , and when Dawn and Mary Anne discovered the high school sweetheart connection between Mr. Spier and Mrs. Schafer , it seemed only natural to encourage them to get together again . It worked , wedding bells rang , and Mary Anne and her father ( and Tigger ) moved in to a cool old farmhouse near the edge of town with Dawn , her mother , and Dawn ’ s younger brother , Jeff . But Jeff decided he missed his father and California too much and went back . Gradually , Dawn also found herself missing her California family . Although it was a very difficult decision , she returned to California , too . Dawn is , as you might have guessed , our honorary California member . Naturally she stays in touch with Mary Anne and her Connecticut family . And recently , Dawn joined the members of the BSC on a cross-country road trip to California . Another pair of best friends in the BSC are Stacey and Claudia . They are very interested in clothes and fashion . Stacey is always up to the second in her look , while Claudia really likes to push the fashion boundaries . That
