ï¿½ to me , '' says Mr Trump . The campaign , Mr Trump has said , is going to be `` a long one '' and will ultimately end up being a party that `` won the hearts of the country '' . `` Everyone had to be ready to take over , '' he says . The campaign has been under pressure since January : a New York Times article said it had been `` overdue '' because it had failed to `` solve the problems '' because of the lack of funds . But it is not the first time the media has failed to mention Mr Trump , although he has not had any trouble having it mentioned on his campaign website . I do n't think of me as someone who is going to take responsibility . If I did , I would have to call the press office on Monday . But at this point I am feeling an urgency and need to call up the news team immediately . I do n't think of me as any sort of an official politician . What I do think of is the fact that , for my own sake , I am not going to change . I have n't decided whether I will be running , to use a catchphrases about why I do it , or whether I would run for other reasons . But I would not be surprised if someone else did choose to do so , or if it was some other person or event . I will try to make everyone aware of it . We 'll start at the start of Monday . The following is a letter I have wrote to the chief executive of BuzzFeed : Hello and I am just a little late . I wanted to talk to you today about the news story The new website for our new project , We 'll Get Things Done , has started up . We 've moved from New York to California , but we want to be very different to our existing website . The first story of course is the election . Our website will be made up of a few articles in the same style as the previous one . Each of those articles will be a different story . And the first is a new article about a little guy named David , our president-elect . His friends have been saying he 's coming to California , and we 'll be able to reach him . He has already started school . He has been in the United States for over a year , but since he was born here , we do n't have time to get into specifics about his education . But he will get out of California and get his parents back into school . David had four siblings , his parents are white , the other two were born in Australia . His parents , Nancy and David , live in Florida and live here with their family . David 's dad has been an educator , and David lives with his grandfather . He was once married again , this time to Claudia , one of our founding parents . Now , we also have our own brand of journalism , The Post 's Newspaper Review ( which is about the New York Times ) . This is a newspaper where you go to newsroom meetings . And the Newscaper Review is a newspaper in which people discuss the latest news and opinions ( in a good way ) . The Journal Review is another newspaper that meets the New York Times standards for editorial diversity . And The Post and The Economist are different because they are different newspapers and editors , but they are both not about the same things . We 've been trying very hard to figure out where Toole came from . `` Toole '' is the spelling of the word , after the letters and symbols . It is a derivative of the French word for `` lice , but also '' ( which might not be true ) . As I see it , Toole was one of those things that made me want to write a new book . That was not the case for me ! Anyway , we had a great time this afternoon . This is why we wanted you to come and watch . Why not ? Because we knew you might not like the way this story was going . And that means we were going to keep our eyes set on this new website until it came online . The website will be hosted at our offices in New York City from noon till 1:30 . By then we could n't wait to get to meeting everyone . And we 'd probably have more to say , too . Our meeting is set for Friday , September 13th at 8:30 am at our offices in New York City . In case you missed one of the meetings you 're welcome to attend as usual . If you would like to talk in-studio with us , please call our office at ( 607 ) 922-5533 at any time . Then , let 's talk for 45 minutes . Thanks again to everyone who has said hello and we hope you 're all happy today . We want to make you happy . We want to make you think about how we are all different , that we are different , and that some of us are only going to be different for this week ,
