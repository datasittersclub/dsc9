things — art supplies or junk food . See , Claud ’ s room is sort of a… . Well , I ’ m sorry , but “ rat hole ” is the best word I can come up with . Okay , it isn ’ t that bad , but it is messy . Claudia needs all sorts of supplies for her projects , and there just isn ’ t enough room for them on her shelves and in her closet . So she ’ s stored boxes of stuff under her bed , in stacks against the wall , everywhere . She ’ s also a junk-food addict , and she really has to hide her Fritos and Doritos and Heath Bars and M & Ms well . That ’ s because her parents don ’ t approve of her habit and told Claud , “ No junk food , ” but she just couldn ’ t give it up . It ’ s hidden everywhere — in the boxes of art supplies , in drawers , even in her pillow . So Dawn and I weren ’ t too surprised to see Claudia half under the bed . I ’ m not supposed to eat right before dinner . Even so , I hoped she was searching for food , not art materials . I was pretty hungry . “ Hi , you guys , ” said Kristy with a smile , as Dawn and I entered Claud ’ s room . “ What ’ s going on ? ” ( We had all just seen each other at school , but that didn ’ t matter . Every time we get together , it ’ s as if we haven ’ t spoken in a week . ) “ We rode downtown to buy toys for Tigger , ” I replied . “ What ’ s Claud doing ? ” “ Looking for my Double Stuf Oreos , ” answered Claudia from under the bed , only it sounded as if she said , “ Lummy fummy dummy fuff ooeey. ” “ Oh , good ! ” exclaimed Kristy . “ Double Stuf Oreos. ” “ How on earth could you understand her ? ” Dawn asked Kristy as she and I settled ourselves gingerly on the bed . We didn ’ t want to crush the vice-president beneath us . Kristy shrugged . “ Practice. ” Claudia emerged from her junk-food hiding place with an unopened package of Double Stuf Oreos in one hand . “ Oh , yum , ” said Kristy , looking as if she might faint from happiness . While Claud was opening the cookies , Jessi and Mal arrived . “ Great . We ’ re all here , ” announced Kristy . “ Let ’ s begin. ” Mal and Jessi took their usual places on the floor , Claudia passed the cookies around , and Kristy called our meeting to order . As president , that ’ s one of her jobs . Maybe I better tell you a little about the club and how it works . We hold meetings three times a week , every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday afternoon from five-thirty until six . Our clients call us during those times to say that they need sitters , and then we schedule the jobs for ourselves , depending on who ’ s free . How do parents know when to call us ? Well , I ’ ll go back to the beginning and tell you how the club started . Then you can find out for yourself . Kristy is the one who thought up the Baby-sitters Club . ( That ’ s the main reason she ’ s the president . ) See , way back at the start of seventh grade , Kristy and her family were still living next door to me and across the street from Claud . Kristy ’ s little brother , David Michael , was six then , and Kristy and her two older brothers , Sam and Charlie ( they ’ re in high school ) , were responsible for baby-sitting for him most of the time , since Mrs. Thomas ( well , now she ’ s Mrs . Brewer ) has a full-time job . But the day came when Kristy ’ s mom needed a sitter for one particular afternoon , and nobody — not Kristy , not Sam , not Charlie — was free . So she got on the phone and began making call after call , in search of a sitter . That was when Kristy got her great idea . What a waste of time , she thought , for her mom to have to make so many calls . Wouldn ’ t it be easy if she could make one call and reach several sitters ? Surely one of them would be free . That was it ! Kristy would get together with several of her friends , we would meet a few times a week , and when someone called , one of us was bound to be free for a job . So the caller was practically guaranteed a sitter . Kristy asked Claudia and me to be in her club . When we decided we needed one more member , Claud introduced us to Stacey McGill , a new friend of hers . Stacey and her parents had just moved to Stoneybrook from New York City . We liked Stacey right away and asked her to join . Then we did some advertising so people would know about our sitting service and how to reach us . And soon we were in business . Kristy , Claudia , Stacey , and I became the first president , vice-president , treasurer , and secretary of the Baby-sitters Club . By the time Dawn moved here , we were doing so much business that we wanted her in the club , too , and when Stacey had to move
