I said . `` What ? '' `` For starters , the company wants to send me on a two-week business trip to Europe . '' `` Europe ! '' I shrieked . `` Europe ? What 's wrong with that ? London ! Paris ! Rome ! Oh , Mom , can I come ? Please ? Are you going over the summer ? I promise I 'll be good . I 'll stay out of your way . I wo n't ask you to buy souvenirs or anything . Just food . Please ? '' Mom gave me a wry smile . `` I 'd like nothing better than to take you to Europe , sweetie , '' she said , `` but unfortunately the trip is scheduled during the school year . '' It was June . There was n't much left to the school year . `` You mean you 're going now ? '' I cried . `` Who 'll stay with us ? '' Mom shook her head . `` I 'm not going now . The trip is scheduled for September . '' She let that sink in . `` I 'm supposed to be in Vienna on the day of the wedding . '' `` Oops , '' I said . `` Oops is right . '' `` So have an October wedding , '' I suggested . `` Think of it—a fall wedding with the leaves turning . It would be really pretty . '' `` I did think of it , actually , '' said Mom . `` I was sitting at my desk , mentally adding sleeves to our gowns and changing the flowers from roses to chrysanthemums , when the phone rang . Guess who it was . '' I 'm not good at guessing games . `` I 'll never guess , Mom . Who was it ? '' `` The real estate agent . And guess—wait , I wo n't make you guess again . Believe it or not , she 's already got a buyer for our house . '' `` Already ! You just put the house on the market two days ago . You thought it would take months to sell it . That 's great news , Mom ! '' `` Sort of great . The buyer is desperate . He 's in a rush . He 's willing to pay what we asked for , which is more than we thought we 'd actually get for the house . Here 's the catch : He 's in such a big hurry that he wants to move his family in by July fifteenth . '' `` Mom , no ! That 's next month . It 's impossible . Sell the house to someone else . '' `` I do n't think anyone else will pay us this much money . '' `` Well , what do we need money for ? You 're marrying Watson . '' `` Honey , Watson and I and Watson 's ex-wife and your father all have various ideas about how to spend our money . It 's quite complicated , but for the time being , let 's just say that I do n't want Watson to feel obliged to finance four extra college educations . The money from the house , half of which , first of all , is your father 's , goes toward college for you and your brothers . So the more we make , the better . '' `` Mom , I 'm trying as hard as I can to follow all of this , but what exactly are you saying ? '' `` I 'm saying that Watson and I are going to have to get married at the end of the month so we can move into the Brewers ' house two weeks later . '' I was stunned . I stared at Mom with my mouth hanging open . David Michael came home , let Louie ( our collie ) in , sat down in Mom 's lap , and still I was openmouthed and speechless . The phone rang . Mom answered it . It was a friend of hers . They had a long , chatty conversation , which ended with Mom saying , `` So the upshot is that the wedding will be in two and a half weeks . '' `` Two and a half weeks , '' I moaned . `` What 's going on ? '' asked David Michael . `` It 's a long story , '' I told him . Mom hung up the phone . She seemed awfully calm—too calm . The next thing I knew , she was going crazy . She leaped to her feet ( David Michael jumped out of her lap just in time ) , held her hands to her head , and cried , `` Oh , my lord ! How can I plan a whole wedding in two and a half weeks ? Two and a half weeks ! Planning a wedding is like having a baby . You need time to prepare things ! You have to talk to the florist , the minister , the dressmaker , the caterer . You have to tell the relatives . You have to rent chairs ! I can just picture the caterer when I order crab crepes for three hundred . He 'll say , 'And what month is the wedding ? December ? ' and I 'll say , 'No , it 's this month , ' and he 'll laugh at me ! '' `` Mom— '' I started to say . David Michael tiptoed across the kitchen and held my hand . He stared at Mom , fascinated . Louie hid under the table . `` A tent ! We have to rent a tent ! '' she cried . `` Rent-a-tent , rent-a-tent , '' chanted David Michael , giggling . `` Mom— '' '' We 'll hold the wedding in
