, Dad wants to clean the house , Sharon says we can let it go for another month or so , and then they have an argument . There are smaller problems , too : Sharon is not a huge fan of cats ( poor Tiggy ) , and Dawn likes to study with the radio or some music on , while I need absolute silence for studying . However , I wouldn ’ t trade these problems for my old life if you paid me a million dollars . I like my new family too much . Dawn and Sharon like it , too . When Jeff moved back to California , Dawn felt as if her family had been ripped in half , her father and brother on one side of the country , Dawn and her mother on the other side . Of course , Dad and I don ’ t make up for Jeff and Mr. Schafer , but Dawn is happier with four people ( plus Tiggy ) in her house , instead of just two . Now , if Logan and I were speaking to each other , and I had a problem and couldn ’ t talk to Dawn , I might turn to him next . Logan is a newer friend than most of my others , but as I ’ ve said , we used to be awfully close . Logan knew what made me nervous or uncomfortable and why . And he didn ’ t try to change me . If I felt self-conscious about dancing at a school hop , then Logan was content to hang around the punch bowl with me . He doesn ’ t believe that the best way to conquer your fears is to meet them face-to-face . Maybe that works for some people , but not for Mary Anne Spier . And Logan understood . That meant a lot to me . Logan is also very patient . I think this is because he has a younger sister and brother , Kerry and Hunter , whom he takes care of pretty often . Kerry is ten and Hunter is five . They ’ re both really cute . Hunter has awful allergies , though , and his nose gets stuffed up , so he usually talks like this : “ Hi , by dabe is Hudter Brudo. ” ( That means , “ Hi , my name is Hunter Bruno. ” ) The Brunos moved to Stoneybrook from Louisville , Kentucky , and they speak with this wonderful accent . I just love listening to Logan . He ’ s not bad to look at , either . In fact , I think he looks just like Cam Geary , who is one of my favorite stars . He has long legs and blondish-brown hair . And his sense of humor is terrific . I miss his humor as much as anything else . Kristy Thomas is my oldest friend and one of my best friends , but she is not necessarily the person I ’ d go to in a crisis . It isn ’ t that Kristy ’ s not understanding — she is — it ’ s just that often her mouth gets in the way of her brain and sometimes ( oh , all right , really often ) she says things she doesn ’ t mean to say . Kristy ’ s been like a sister to me , though , and our families have gone through similar kinds of changes recently , so Kristy is pretty sympathetic where some subjects are concerned . Kristy and I grew up next door to each other , right across the street from Claudia Kishi , in fact . Kristy has three brothers — two older ones , Sam and Charlie , who go to Stoneybrook High School ; and a younger one , David Michael , who ’ s in second grade at the elementary school . She has a mom and a dad , too , only she never sees her father . Mr. Thomas walked out on his family when Kristy was about six . Now he lives somewhere in California . After Mr. Thomas left , Kristy ’ s mother had to scramble around to hold her family together , and she did really well . She got a job at a company in Stamford , and now she ’ s a V.I.P . ( Very Important Person ) , with an even bigger job there . Anyway , back when Kristy and I were just beginning seventh grade , Kristy ’ s mom was just beginning to date this guy named Watson Brewer , who happened to be a millionaire and who also happened to be Kristy ’ s future stepfather . Mrs. Thomas and Watson ( I call him by his first name because that ’ s how Kristy refers to him ) got married during the summer after seventh grade . Suddenly Kristy found herself living a new life . Watson moved the Thomases out of their small house — in which Sam and Charlie had shared a room , and David Michael ’ s room was about the size of a closet — and across town to his mansion , which is so big that everyone who lives there has his or her own bedroom . ( Well , except for Watson and Kristy ’ s mother . They share a room , of course . ) And you should hear who lives in the mansion now . Aside from Kristy and her family and Watson , there are Karen and Andrew Brewer , Emily Michelle , and Nannie . Karen and Andrew are Kristy ’ s little stepsister and stepbrother , Watson ’ s kids from his first marriage . Karen just turned seven , and Andrew is almost five . Even though they live with their mom and stepfather most of the time ( not far away ; just in another neighborhood in Stoneybrook ) ,
