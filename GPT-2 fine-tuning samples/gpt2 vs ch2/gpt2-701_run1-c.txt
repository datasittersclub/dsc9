acey Claudia Kishi ; Kristy ’ s “ old homeroom teacher ” ” who has never , ever , once , given a straight A to a B . ( I think she calls this one one the “ Class Day Sixteen ” thing . In those days , it didn ’ t really matter which one of us stuck it to her mouth or what . It was a B joke . ) And Claudia ’ s “ homeroom ” is where we meet Mary Anne : at her room and the desks and the pencil case . ( I ’ m not sure why she keeps those boxes filled with junk stuff strewn all over her room . They ’ re the perfect size for holding junk-related books and pens and calendars . ) Mary Anne can never forget Claudia ’ s desk . It is packed full of numbers and pencils , and her desk is decorated in red and black and white . ( Mary Anne never looks shamefully at Claud ’ s desk . ) And when it rains , Mary Anne puts up pro bono canvases and leafs through old letters and photos . If I had to do another job for Claud in an apartment like Mary Anne ’ s , it would be answering tips on the phone during the club meetings . I hate answering such a job , but Mary Anne gives it a try every now and then . Besides being the BSC treasurer , Mary Anne is the one who invented the Baby-sitters Club . Back in 1795 , a little girl named Emily was trying to get a father . Her mother wanted her father only until she was thirteen . So Mrs. Winslow offered it up to the Winslow family . They got married , and the family moved in with the Winslow family until ( sadly ) the family broke up . Then they met the next family member — and who — the couple 's three kids ! They got married — and the Winslow family is what the Baby-sitters Club is known as — ” “ The Squire ’ s wife ! ” screeched Kristy . “ I can get your father ’ s attention on Sunday afternoon just the way I can afford to shop at Macy ’ s. ” The last word came at a perfect time . Mary Anne and her father were going on vacation . It was time for a meeting of the BSC , but instead they adjourned to the last call . “ We have business , Claud . The telephone is ringing . Could you dial the numbers between $ 20 and $ 30 ? I ’ ve got one of my friends calling . And I just need one line and you get the lead. ” I did . “ I ’ ve got the phone , ” said Kristy , laughing . “ Trevor says you better get right back to Mr. Winslow right here. ” “ You get the lead ? ” exclaimed Kristy . “ What ? ” “ I say , ‘ bye , ’ I told him . ’ What are you doing here ? ” “ Well … well , ” asked Kristy , ‘ bye , ’ but with a capital O . ’ bye , ’ well … well … Then I knew it was time for a meeting of the Baby-sitters Club . “ Hi , all-you-can-eat-from-the-cartoons club ! ” called Claudia Kishi , who was checking a book in the library at the Stoneybrook Public Library . A club meeting usually follows that meeting . Usually , the members of the club are Claudia and me , sitting around the same place on Claudia ’ s bed , talking about anything related to children or the mysteries of our favorite books . Claudia is my best friend , and sometimes I get excited talking about such subjects as the mysteries of the kitty , or the mysteries of the rat , or the mystery of the horned owl . Claud often comes up with some really amazing ideas . One of them was studying the pages of a old Mrs. Nicholls ’ softball book and discovering that … well , she loves the book , and so does Claud . But Claud , who knows exactly what kind of love lives in an apartment like the Pikes ’ . And so on . So we always meet there at Claudia ’ s at least six minutes away from the meeting . Claudia , who ’ s really shy and quiet , is my best friend in the game . You can see why I think she ’ d love it when I fell in love with it . It was this : I have a three-legged friend ! Well , yes , I ’ ve got a dog , and I have a cat . But Claudia is not the kind of dog-sitter . She ’ s not even the fashion-challenged starlet
