” Kristy Thomas announced from the door to my room . “ Call the newspapers . Claudia Kishi is cleaning her room and singing lullabies . She must have lost her mind. ” “ Very funny. ” I clicked off the vacuum cleaner . “ I just happen to be turning over a new leaf. ” “ What leaf ? ” Mary Anne Spier peered over Kristy ’ s shoulder . “ If you want leaves , our front yard is covered with them . It ’ s going to take a week to rake them all up. ” Kristy turned to Mary Anne and explained , with a very serious face , “ Claudia ’ s not collecting leaves , she ’ s turning them over. ” “ Turning over leaves ? ” Stacey called from behind them as she came up the stairs . “ What ’ s that , some kind of performance art ? ” Can you tell that Baby-sitters Club meetings can get awfully silly ? Of course , they can also be pretty serious , but today was definitely a goofy day . Before I tell you any more about the meeting , I should keep my promise to tell you about the club and everyone in it . Here goes . The Baby-sitters Club history has to start with Kristy Thomas , our president . It was Kristy ’ s great idea to form the club and it ’ s Kristy ’ s even greater ideas that keep it running smoothly . Her own story is a little complicated . You see , she used to live right across the street from me with her mom , who was divorced , and her three brothers , Charlie ( who is seventeen , and in high school ) , Sam ( he ’ s fifteen ) and David Michael ( age seven ) . Then Kristy ’ s mom fell in love with this millionaire named Watson Brewer and everybody ’ s lives changed . First , Mrs. Thomas married Watson and became Mrs . Brewer . Then the whole Thomas family moved from their nice little house on Bradford Court to Watson ’ s huge mansion across town . It ’ s a good thing he has a mansion , because ten people live there most of time . How ’ d they end up with ten ? Well , you see , Watson has two kids of his own : Karen , who ’ s seven , and Andrew , who ’ s four . They live with Watson every other month . After Watson and Kristy ’ s mom got married , they adopted Emily Michelle from Vietnam , who is two and a half . Then Nannie , Kristy ’ s grandmother , moved in to help look after Emily , and that brought the total to ten . What else can I say about Kristy ? She has brown hair and brown eyes . She ’ s the shortest girl in the eighth grade , but she more than makes up for it with her big personality . Kristy ’ s a natural leader . Besides being president of our club , she coaches Kristy ’ s Krushers , a neighborhood softball team . Kristy ’ s a real athlete and dresses like one . No frills — just jeans , a turtleneck , a sweater , and sneakers . It ’ s practically her uniform . Sometimes Kristy can be stubborn and bossy , but I guess that goes with being a leader . One other thing about Kristy — she won ’ t admit it , but she has this semi-romance going with a guy named Bart Taylor . They ’ re made for each other . Bart coaches a softball team called Bart ’ s Bashers , he ’ s crazy about Kristy , and they both like anchovies ( ew ! ick ! ) . See ? A perfect match . I ’ m the BSC vice-president . Not because I have any presidential skills , but because I have my own phone and number . Pretty neat , huh ? That ’ s why we hold the meeting in my room . I do the artwork for our club fliers and share my snacks ( which are generally stashed out of sight , under the bed or behind a box of art supplies , since my parents don ’ t approve of my junk-food habit ) . You already know all about me , so I ’ ll move on to the treasurer of the BSC , my best friend , Anastasia Elizabeth McGill . If I had to come up with a list of words to describe Stacey , I ’ d write : smart , gorgeous , ultra-cool , and sophisticated . She looks and acts a lot older than she is , partly because she grew up in New York City and partly ( I think ) because of her diabetes . I don ’ t mean that diabetes ages you or anything like that . In case you don ’ t know ( and I didn ’ t until I met Stacey ) , diabetes is a disease that keeps your body from processing sugar properly . So Stacey has to stay on a strict diet and never , ever break it . She also has to give herself shots ( ew ! ) of insulin every single day . It ’ s more responsibility than the average thirteen-year-old has to deal with , and that ’ s why I think it ’ s made her more mature . Stacey ’ s learned to live with being a diabetic , so it ’ s not a big deal , except for those times when there ’ s extra pressure in her life and she forgets to take care of herself . Then it can be scary . Stacey has even had to go into the hospital since I ’ ve known her . Of
