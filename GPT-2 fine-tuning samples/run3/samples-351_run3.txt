 sneakers. Stacey will take over Jessi’s job. It’s a big job for the Ramseys, too, since parents call the neighborhood jobs when they need sitters.

Besides Abby and Stacey, Claudia (Kristy’s best friend) has two other best friends. Mal has two: her younger sister, Becca, and her baby brother, Andrew. And her aunt, Nannie, runs a pizza parlour in Mal's new neighborhood … oh, who said fair trade has to be bad trade?

Claudia is a great sitter, even if she has a big mouth. Her style is casual and casual not-to-grill, which is why she looks so cool these days. She’s one of those talents without a reason. Claudia does have some neat moves or unusual habits, though. For instance, her hair is sometimes colored a reddish-brownish-red color, and there’s a slight reddish-brown accent to her nose.

Clothes are Claudia’s one of her biggest passions. Her idea of decor is her closet. It’s a closet that her parents once made her have. That’s right, Claudia has a closet of her own, too. She hides her closet when she’s not around Claudia, which means everyone else is too.

She hides her notebook because if it’s left for too long, you wouldn’t have any notebook at all.

Clothing is Claudia’s boyfriend’s. He has seven kids, including Jessica Ramsey and Karen (yes, two kids, one girl). That one boy is Bart (Mallory Pike and Karen from the original TV show), and three, one-year-old boys. His name is John Henry, Jr., and he is a regular boy with a big personality. And he’s adorable.

Oh, and Claudia also has a notebook, a notebook in case someone calls and puts a bunch of words together. They look pretty similar. They look like writing notebook entries on someone else’s paper, but Claudia doesn’t want them to look alike.

Okay, I’ll cover how to handle Claudia’s notebook. Before I go on, the rest of the club members should know about Claud’s “daydream‘” — her dreams of a real high school career.<|endoftext|>
The next day, Janine’s eyes were glazed over as she stared up at the ceiling as if she were a primordial energy drawing herself into a universe she couldn’t stop expanding.

“What on earth is happening’?” asked Mary Anne. She looked around the room.

“The sun is setting. It’s about time we start the comet hunt.”

Mary Anne gulped. “We want to.”

I swallowed. I almost choked on my orange juice.

“That’s fine. If the comet has come, why not’t I just get it right away?”

I gulped again. I gulped as much as I could manage. The phone rang three more times the next morning. This time, it was Stacey who answered. “Baby-sitters Club.” The club is Kristy’s company’s business, one of the great ones in all of publishing. And like Stoneybrook’s great publishing, our business is a success. Kristy’s company ran the club with the same kind of commitment and commitment. As you know, it was Kristy who founded Kristy’s Krushers, our school’s team of younger kids. We hold regular baby-sitting classes with our charges in the evenings.

Kristy made us take club baby-sitting activities, and we did. The club was growing, and Kristy was president. We were already getting plenty of work. That afternoon Kristy and I were sitting in her director of student services office. They were sitting in Claudia Kishi’s dressing room. “Hi, my name is Stacey,” she said, as we settled into our usual spot. “I was just doing something interesting, and our president said she was going to have to turn me away if she saw that I was using a new name. I was trying to convince the secretary she’d like an honorary officer if she could meet that requirement.” I couldn’t believe it. It sounded so odd that it practically knocked my brain off it. But Kristy, who is the smartest girl in the sixth grade, knew exactly what she was doing.
 "Hey, look at me, actually," she continued. "I can’t stand that
