 him.

The first thing I did when I walked into her house was tearfully kiss her goodbye.

The next thing I knew, the phone rang, and in no time I had it answered, "Baby-sitters Club."

“Kristy, it’s your turn. Hi, it’s Roderick.” That was the first of a string of calls that afternoon. Kristy’s mother couldn’t be home too soon. She refused to be cowed, not awhile, and she also refused to have a little extra time together.

I had to get to the bottom of it all: why were the Barrettes so worried about Kristy? What had happened to their friendship? And why hadn’t they been so nice to her?

In all this trouble, I have never made a poor error.

“I’ve been informed that some members of your club are going to try to recruit you as an alternate officer,” Claudia Kishi explained to Kristy, who was standing in front of the bathroom door. “I’m afraid they won’t be able to.”

“You’re right, Kristy,” Jessi Ramsey offered, trying to calm me down. “You missed the opener. You promised Mary Anne we’d call you back when there weren’t any more jobs available. I’ll do my part to help you, Kristy.”

“All right,” Kristy agreed, opening the appointment pages of our club notebook. I have to admit, I had a little more work than I wanted to do. But I went home and printed up flyers. You should have seen what I made of.

The next thing I knew, I had a job as an editor at the local paper. And then we had a New York City Mets game. In between club meetings, I ran into Shannon Kilbourne, who lives in the city. (As you can imagine, I was psyched for her.)

We've been friends since we were at least seventh grade, when Kristy discovered that she was only eleven and Emily Michelle was in sixth. Now I had a look at her, and she smiled and shook her head.

“What?” I asked the BSC secretary, Mary Anne Plunkett.

The three of us joined forces to form the Baby-sitters Club. The idea had its genesis as a brainstorm. That’s what we call a job. We’ve decided that if we can recruit a whole group of good baby-sitters, we’ll share it with the New York Mets game, and everyone else in the Big Apple, so we call it a truce. So after the game, everyone’s available. Then we call the parents to see who’s available for the job. Most of the time we meet three times a week, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons and at Claud’s house.

The BSC members aren’t just sitters, either. We’ve all got a club notebook where we write about our jobs. That’s where we write about anyone who comes to a job. If we’re sure we’re going to get the job, we tell about it, describing the experience so far.

As president, Kristy keeps very much on her own mind. She’s not a shy person, and always looks out for the well-being of the people she follows. This goes for Kristy too. Her dad raised four kids, two older and one younger, until her mom died when she was just a baby. That left Kristy’s mom to take care of four kids: Kristy, her two older siblings, and her two younger brothers. (Mrs. Thomas, who works for a publishing company in the city, is usually this nice and careful.)

Kristy also breeds good looks. She has these terrific long legs, and she’s pretty strong. She’s pretty short (she ran a very competitive softball team for fun — it was called Kristy’s Krushers), and she’s petite with big brown eyes. Maybe her life is more a movie set than a sports field.

Here’s what else she hasn’t changed — clothes, art, books, and, most important, the way she dresses. You will not believe how she dresses, as I’ve explained to me endlessly. You can’t look at Kristy not as a person, but as a person of color and also as a person of color. Kristy’s skin is a deep reddish-brown to brown (almost white just from the seclusion of her bedroom) with
