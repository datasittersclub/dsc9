 across the city. You know, Stoneybrook feels like a really hot little city. We call it a hot and humid climate, and we want to be the top capital of the West Coast.

But we also do everything possible to support the club. A lot. We have a club fund to pay for our pizza and a club club for the kids who sit for the kids. We also rent a mansion for the kids to live in for their own kids. And we pay for clothing, for our Mal's Day kit, and for things to help us get by. We also make a pretty big budget for Kid-Kit, which is a bunch of fun things we've bought for our kids. (We think Kid-Kits are neat, and we always add new stuff in the mail if we need it.)

So you can see that this is a big club, and I think you should know that it's a big club. But as I said, it also reflects the fact that we all love to do pretty big things. We're super-organized and fun, and super-well organized. That's hard for me to believe, but I love to think about how great it would be to be a Baby-sitter, and how much we'd all miss the weekend.

We're always busy. But that's fine because we're super-organized and fun and well organized. Plus, if we don't have time to baby-sit by Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, we don't have time to work, either. That means we're not able to take walks or baby-sit for the whole family on weekends. We also can't baby-sit for a weekend, because, well, we don't have time to have one.

And that's where Kristy and I come in. We write at the meetings and she and I can both write in their own babies' names when they need help. We meet at Kristy's house and we're super-organized and can fill in for anyone who has to be. We also have a private phone line so that whenever a baby-sitter needs their special help, we always have number one available to give it to them at a moment's notice.

So I guess I'll just say what Kristy is best known for: her lovey-nunch box that's like a secret passage in her closet.

Stacey McGill’s parents don’t exactly like her.

Stacey is my best friend. She’s pretty smart. She’s also very independent. Her mom died when Stacey was a baby, and her dad has left the family. So Stacey has never seen her Mom and Dad alone with a baby girl (or boy, if you prefer, but you can tell by her clothes).

It’s tough to see Stacey. She’s big, dark, slender, black, with long, wide brown hair and gorgeous, almond-shaped eyes. And she makes herself the world’s easiest person for a woman with curly blonde hair. I have a feeling she’ll grow into that shade right up. She's very fashionable, and even I know her parents would be proud.

I have a feeling they would.

We meet regularly at the library in Kristy’s room. The only reason we call the girls by their first names is because the officers of the Reading Club can’t always be easily found. Anyway, the meeting is a good example of what you can do when you have two baby-sitters, and several sitting jobs.

In this case, I have to come up with a baby-sitter-to-sitter plan, too. I write in Kristy’s name, and I assign a sitting job to Mary Anne, who is in her late thirties (or early for that matter), with a steady supply of baby-sitting supplies in the library, which I always keep up-to-date with.

Then, one day, in my busy, busy life and with great reason, I decide on an appointment with the Baby-sitters Club President. I have a hard time believing it, but there it is: my first appointment, a sitting job for Mary Anne, the baby of two brothers, Jeff and David Michael. Mary Anne, who is one of the oldest kids in the entire family, has an extremely strict set of rules about when she can and cannot sit for anybody.

Mary Anne’s parents didn’t exactly get around to me and insisted I sit before her during my afternoon meeting. And they did what I told them not to do: They told Mary Anne to wear her hair in a ponytail on my sitting jumpers, which she does, during school hours at Claudia Kishi’s. And Mary Anne is a natural for a sitting job. She loves math, sports, dancing
