======== SAMPLE 1 ========

I sat on one edge of the bed. It wasn't too far. Stacey had pulled off her turtleneck shirt over the top of her tie-dyed belt-hugging skirt. The sleeves of her skirt hung almost entirely up from her knees, and underneath, there was a pair of jeans that matched her blue-and-green, athletic jumpsuit. (It was really a jumpsuit, a very long, long white shirt with a pair of jumpsuit-like, oversized white shirts perched on top of one other tie-dyed belt that was pulled down to be the same height, similar to Claud's. She wore glasses, which Claud had longed to replace, but Stacey couldn't find those.) Her clothes matched Claud's, but they weren't all that high. She just had a great big, big, big wardrobe. Claud was pretty different from everyone else in all my classes. She was very independent, and she wanted to be an art director — just like Mary Anne, who was very independent. Her mom had divorced when Claud was seven. Stacey didn't get to see her parents for awhile, but she made it known that she wants to be an artist. Claudia's mom doesn't make sure she gets a steady job. I do too, although I'd like to be a musician someday. Anyway, Stacey came to me from an extremely distant place, and she's not an artist. She's a dancer, a professional ballerina. And I think that's not a bad thing, because she loves to dance and is one of the best ballersina in all of the world. In fact, Stacey has been dancing for maybe three years now. That means she's been doing so much choreography that I don't think anyone could possibly replace her for the position. That said, Claudia is a very talented ballet dancer and a great student, too. And this is only true for Stace, because she's one of those talented dancers with her own style of play. Claudia is very good at taking down anything in her way. The hardest things can happen to graceful, graceful people. Claudia is a great sports announcer, though. Her voice is very good — and the truth is, her sports sense came from a horse! She's a great dancer, too: She never lets her mind get in the way of her training and she enjoys it. She has a very high IQ and she also has great ideas. You'd think Claudia is a gifted dancer, but I don't believe so. At a certain point, Claudia will ask for a job and the club can let her. Sometimes the person she gives permission to go is a member of a different club, the BSC. The BSC has seven officers, eight sitting members, and four special members who have special jobs. They get together at least once a month and decide who goes to a certain club meeting. They look out for our clients and we do a good job.

Claudia’s room

That’s right, Claudia has a very big room in the club. Not the small, but the big enough and the roomy enough. Like the rest of us, Claudia likes being near you, with great attention, not thinking you’re something else except yourself.

For example, you wouldn’t know this if you were seated right behind my mother, which she never does. Claudia has curly, blonde hair and wears sparkly jewelry. It’s as if she has some kind of special interest. And if you look at Claudia’s other looks, she’s really gorgeous and pretty strong. She has black hair and glasses and you just can’t make out what she’s wearing.

Claudia and I look alike, but I’m a newcomer to Claudia’s family, which is a big reason I get to be that way. I’m a baby, too, which means Claudia has a very big family too, but it just makes things even crazier. Claudia just grew up around the quiet, cool family you come from, and I think her family always had a kind of cool-to-goodness-going quality. As I mentioned before, Claudia, like I’m a newcomer, has this very cool idea for her bedroom, a very cool-to-goodness-going wardrobe. That way, she never has to constantly be in a bad mood.

The BSC has six members, and so is Claudia’s family. That includes Mary Anne, the associate member, who has seven brothers and sisters, three of whom are very special. The oldest baby brother is Bruno McGill, who’s a millionaire. And, in a way, that sounds a little off, because the baby brother is always running the house, not worrying about anybody. He’s the only one of us who can do anything for someone, and even if they don�
