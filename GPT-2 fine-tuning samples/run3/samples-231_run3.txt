er, and I love Stacey too much to let her keep the job. Jessi and I went to private school together and, after we both had a taste of the BSC, we decided to form the Baby-sitters Club. But we didn't wait until the last few months to prove ourselves. We advertised on our own, and we thought people would be surprised how quickly the club was running its mile. One of the ideas was for a BSC officer. The club treasurer (a member of the club), Mary Anne Spier, a friend of the club's founder, and Abby Stevenson, as well as Kristy’s mother, moved to Stoneybrook after they met. Mr. Spier was an old pal, and he always seemed a little overprotective. I don’t know why. It sounded a little weird to us, because he thought that everyone was supposed to step in to fix things, not work.

The Baby-sitters Club was a real success at first. We used the money to buy our own instruments, to buy supplies for Claud’s homework, and so on. Then we got together with Mary Anne and I and Kristy and I and Mary Anne and Charlie to form the BSC. And I love having such a great idea — it’s hard when you think you’re going to make it happen. I have a feeling we were right about one thing.

Anyway, the club was one of the most moving things I have ever been involved in. I loved it and, even though I’d been out to California and to New York City before, it’s never really left me, and I know people in Stoneybrook are proud of it.

Our other main client, Claudia Kishi, has two younger brothers. One of them is named John Philip Rutherford, Jr., another a girl named Janine Brewer named Janine. They’re in high school, but Claudia is the only one of them with a steady boyfriend. That’s because they’re the oldest kids in their family, and their father died when they were just a baby. (I guess I should have known that.) Then they’d both gone away and one of them got married, and all of a sudden the other family seemed like a lot. But Claudia felt just a bit more distant than she did when she first married him. She’d lived with him in our house, for nine months, until she found him — and he was sad. She felt jealous and she felt her father didn’t give her the same respect he had for her when she first moved back to California. And her feelings were hurt — and I know that’s how she ends up.

But I guess Claudia’s family was sad. So too were the other girls. But that was after they’re in high school, which means they’re practically in sixth grade. So when the marriage came along, you can’t really blame them. You just have to wonder whether Claud and Kristy really feel this way. I guess they feel that their mother was too caring — and too much of a domineering parent. And they feel that their dad and Claud’s mother are the same, although they’ve had different parents (I’ll explain that a bit in a second). But just like me, they think a lot of the time that their parents are just too independent. So it was nice that they were in contact, and they decided they’d be best friends.

“You, Claud, and I, and everyone else, are our charges,” Kristy mused.

“I don’t know,” Mary Anne Spier said.

“But I guess I can feel it,” Claudia blurted out.

“You know what?” Kristy interrupted, giving me a glance.

“I was just thinking what would happen if I’d married a guy I knew,” Claudia said. “I mean, maybe this wouldn’t be all perfect. But someday I’m going to be a girl.” She leaned over and kissed her ear as if to say a sweetening kiss.

“Kristy, there’s something I need to tell you before I start,” Mary Anne commented sadly. That’s how Kristy handles all her conflicts. In fact, it’s even a part of her job description when she’s not doing her homework. She hates it when people treat her like an inferior, and at one time she was bossy and jealous. Nowadays she’s quiet and sweet. But she’s pretty cool sometimes. She looks like an artist and wears black, dark, oversized glasses. She’s got
