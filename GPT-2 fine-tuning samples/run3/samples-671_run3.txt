’s a terrific idea. But there are other ways you can make a difference.

The first practical joke about the BSC came when Shannon Kilbourne was too darn cranky to bring her Smartphone with her. You could tell she was thinking it through. Why, if she held it up, she was holding it at all, so I might see what was in the middle of it, too.

Then Shannon jumped out and said, “Hey,” and quickly got on the phone. She talked to Mary Anne for a couple of minutes. Then she started singing the national anthem. Then she announced Sturgill Simpson, who is one of our favorite movie stars, and asked everyone if they wanted to see him act. Then Jeff was having a field day. Everyone thought he was some kind of accident.

Shannon made a beeline for New York City, and then she called Logan and said she would talk to him about it later, but she said she was afraid New York was too dangerous.

Mary Anne looked at her watch. It was nearly 5:30. She sounded alarmed. Dawn Schafer, who was waiting for her, seemed slightly more concerned.

I sat next to Shannon for the longest period of time, though I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t help thinking about the BSC. I knew it had to be very successful, even if people like Mary Anne couldn’t always be sure of their own future.

In the beginning, the BSC was basically a simple business with just me, Kristy, and the telephone. I’m not a founding member (although, by the way, I’m the only one to ever get the BSC charter). But then Stacey graduated with just one condition. She had to get work! And she did it!

Stacey grew up in New York City, and lived there for very, very baby-sitting. Then, she moved back to NYC to live with her dad (he left the city at the end of seventh grade). Soon after, when Stacey’s parents got a divorce, her mother sent Stacey back to NYC. Her situation had gotten out of control, and she’d been through a lot of bad times.

Unfortunately, things were not sorted out between her parents, which made her nearly the entire family in one house. (In fact, Stacey’s entire family is in that house, so the house was a mess.)

So, at the beginning of the new business year, I enlisted Stacey!

I couldn’t wait to start making calls. (Seriously, though — let me tell you about my idea. Why are there so many BSC ideas? Why can’t we all just do one? What if each member of the BSC had her own phone number? Imagine being able to call one number and reach several help people.)

Stacey was right around the corner. Her mom was phoning a zillion times in the next few minutes, trying to reach as many sitters as possible. Kristy, who had been sitting right down, suddenly leaped into action, telling all the members to get on the phone and hook them up.

What a waste of time. Stacey’s mom was in the middle of making phone calls trying to reach parents who had not yet begun speaking to relatives. All they had to do was line up our sitters. It was ridiculous. Wouldn’t that be great if they just had to?

I thought back to last Wednesday. Kristy said we were about to start BSC meetings, when Stacey called the office of an associate member to tell her we were trying out of California.

That made me think of Thursday morning. After all her other calls, Tiffany’s had come in first. We were sitting for an hour-and-a-side project, just getting started. Then Stacey’s sister, Janine, showed up to pick up the phone and make a tie-double second call, just to fill the spot. As Kristy and I waited for her, Stacey lifted her head back high in the seat and said, “My name is Stacey. Is this a surprise?”

That kind of stuff just doesn’t happen often. Maybe she should just be careful about what she’s talking about.

That’s all I could say. I was just about to tell the rest of my story, but when Kristy walked in the door (so we waited for her) I looked just a little worried. I wondered what she’d be doing. I wondered if I’d ever run out of snacks, too.

“Hi, Mrs. Prezzioso. This is Kristy.” I cried out. Kristy is
