It was a good sign.

As for my parents, I'd rather have kids. I grew up without a steady brother and sister who would make a baby-sitter. Mrs. Newman and Mary Anne are very different. She's a practicing health-food cook (her parents call her a cook, and she knows her name at school) and is allergic to grains and sweets. I guess it just reflects how close she is to me. I feel bad for my dad, but they're pretty different.

I think Stacey came up with the idea early on. "Maybe I'd be a good mom," she said to me after we hung out, "if I could help someone else who has asthma or other health problems. Mom and dad are not good friends. Maybe someday they'll become good-natured, too."

I didn't think I'd make it to Stacey's meeting. Maybe I would have been a baby-sitter myself. Maybe. Stacey's family has four brothers and sisters, and the family is big â€” triple the size. Her parents are divorced. Her sister, Janine, moved to Stoneybrook from New York.

My family grew into a household just because one part of me still wanted to be a parent.

In the beginning, that meant I had to be really special. If I didn't have the best grades I wouldn't be able to make it to a meeting of the BSC. So I took a job at a shoe store in Manhattan and had my whole life planned out. I could also dress up and do gymnastics. Or even make up really cute baby pictures. I could even do the famous makeup job, too. But it wasn't enough. It needed to be special.

Stacey's father, a real-estate mogul called Jeff, and his mother, a math and science major, were the ones who convinced us to have a meeting. Jeff had taken over the job and the family looked a little different. Now, when I look at my dad, I can see he's a real boss.

But I was really impressed by the new guy. Andrew Pike. He took over and we all looked a lot older, except for Jeff and Mary Anne.

Andrew is an original baby-sitter. His best friend is Shannon Kilbourne. She's an absolute genius. And she's very talented.

Shannon is also terrific about spelling. She's been in high school English. And she writes and creates wonderful original stories (the BSC motto is "Be careful when you call Shannon, not Mal!").

What I love about Shannon is her creative expression. She goes on walks and is funny, graceful, and really shy.

The main interest of Shannon is her brain. She has an enormous amount of it. I am told that she cries at night because, in Shannon's world, everything is her own. That her memory is perfect, and that she can tell you the thoughts, feelings, and ideas behind every word you say, but that she doesn't know exactly what you're thinking at all.

By the time she was fifteen, in sixth grade, Shannon's father, who'd left him to take care of his business, told her that Shannon would not attend school. Shannon moved back to Stamford with her mother and her own family, but her father stayed. In my hometown, Shannon has been lucky to arrive with her mom and her younger brother, who's a millionaire. Shannon finds her life is different, but she's happy that her mom is back. And her dad's life is very different from mine, and it's one of strangeness.

Shannon and her family live in an apartment on 17th St. They call it the house, because, to her, that's a good thing.

Shannon is Japanese-American. She grew up in a very big Japanese-American household. But right away she met a Japanese guy she knew on the street. She dated him pretty quickly (he's Japanese-American), and they dated for about a year before they dated officially. (I'm not going to pretend here is all Japanese-American. I'm just saying that Shannon is Japanese-American.) When they first met, he had met Shannon in New York City on a rainy day. They settled down and Shannon's mom started dating a guy named Claud, whom Shannon really adores, after they dated for about a year! In fact, they had met before they ever knew that Claud and Shannon were in love!

As you can tell from the photo, Claud looks a bit like Shannon. He's a fashion photographer from New Jersey who happens to be a millionaire. Shannon is also an environmentalist. She's an environmentalist. Shannon even made plans to become a pro animal-welfare club. But in the end, it wasn't enough. It didn't help that Claud was a very close, very big guy
