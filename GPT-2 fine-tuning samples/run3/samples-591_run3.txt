 right the best place to ask the big question and take the baby’s first steps. In many ways, she looked like a toddler. She was on her own when Dawn and I joined the BSC, but when she started school last year she had to join the We Kids Club (which means she goes to Stoneybrook Middle School). She moved in with her mom and father and met Mary Anne’s brother Jeff, who is an executive editor at a big publishing company in California. They fell in love and had a pretty successful wedding, and that’s how we became the seventh of the seven BSC members. (The other two are me and Logan Bruno, the alternate officer who’s not in the club.) We thought we were huge sisters, but we couldn’t bear that attitude, so Mary Anne and me went our separate ways. We’d decided we’d go our separate ways again, and decided it was time to figure a new life for ourselves and our family in Manhattan. We thought we’d find a great apartment in a great place near where Dawn’s father lives, and then decide that we’d need a pretty long stay in California to be reunited with Dawn. Our parents weren’t really divorced, but for a long time after we settled that, Dawn’s mother had grown up in Stoneybrook. She had moved back to California after all, and after all it really had been a dream come true for her. Now Mary Anne had to return to her old hometown to visit her dad.

The BSC had a new, younger member recently, Logan Bruno. They’re really cute, with long curly hair and pierced ears. Logan and his twin brother, Andrew, are also very different from most of the BSC members. They are both short for their age, with silky black hair and dark brown eyes and they’re both petite. They have very different musical tastes — and they’re both used to their usual preening. And they both love to read, especially horse stories, especially ones written by Marguerite Henry. (That means they happen to like Mal and me as much as anything, but when the time comes, when we need books to baby-sit, Logan is still reading some of my stories and then going on vacation with the kids.)

For my health, I’m the Queen of the BSC. I’m also the alternate officer, which means I have to be extra ready to jump in to any major case at a meeting. I’m not afraid to take over any job for anyone (except for something as sensitive as homework). So the only thing I’ve changed about one person is the way I dress. Now, when I take over for an associate member, she or he can take over any job she’s given me, and then we can hold our own meetings. That’s great for me because when I'm in a meeting, I have the freedom of choosing a person for the job — and I think it’s awesome.

Anyway, one of the things I have learned, while I’d been studying closely, is that you can always tell a kid by his or her clothes. There were jeans (or turtlenecks — two pairs of unopened jeans, I think — that Kristy thought were too tight for my thirteen-year-old brother), a turtleneck, and a sweatshirt (the sweatshirt was a new pair of jeans, the same fabric as the old ones she wore when she was really, really young — and I know she felt bad about it), and a pair of sweats that looked a lot like sweats bags these days. But I decided that the way I dressed was really important, and I decided I was going to have to change. What had I worn that afternoon that was different? A little stuff, like jeans, which were pretty short and used up a little. Plus, I was wearing some sort of a little-kid-girl outfit these days, I guess to impress Kristy, and right before I walked into Claudia’s room I was so excited I forgot about the wedding and about the Pikes’ house; I was going to sit at home and watch the wedding; I’d seen them all!

I stopped thinking about it at all.

And when I looked behind me, I saw Jessica Ramsey and Mallory Pike. They were dressed in school clothes — shorts, jeans, and a turtleneck. There were no girls at the house, just girls, of all ages and abilities, in bright pink and black. They’re Jessi Ramsey’s best friends and they’re not into clothes or anything. But they sure don’t seem to mind, either. They are major role models to me (even though they don’t like to admit
