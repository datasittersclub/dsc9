======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Jessy was getting calls from people who needed sitters. That’s how we organized the Kid-Kits.

Kid-Kits are cardboard boxes filled with our old games, toys, and books, plus new supplies such as photographs, paintings, or sculptures. A picture of Mallory would make a great sitter paper, so that was always a problem. She would have to come across as quiet and shy, and be willing to sit whenever it was available. That was always a problem, too. We did a great job of dealing with her.

Then, when Stacey was diagnosed as having a nervous breakdown and was feeling particularly down and disappointed, we took her to her. She was quietly happy, and we hoped she would bounce back.

This is how the club works. Seven qualified sitters are assigned to each job. That’s easy. Just one sitter per club member. Then two of us are responsible for snacks: Jessi and Mal, we sitters at the weekends, but also when the weekends are not full. When they are, we write about the experiences they have — stories, sports, art, anything that might help in the future.

That’s all okay, I admit. Parents appreciate sitting problems. But as long as the writing is decent, the brainstorming is second nature. Kristy, Stacey, Mary Anne, and Kristy stroke that reputation. (By the way, do they? The Baby-sitters Club is one of my favorite jobs!)

In many ways, the club is more like a business than a business, partly because of the jobs it provides. Kristy, our president, is an organized person. She runs the club in her own way, like a business. And when a client calls, she does it with aplomb.

Kristy has had plenty of boss battles. But I think she’ll be a very successful club president once she’s alloting some other person’s job to solve some big mystery.

Claudia is vice-president and I think she’ll run the club like a pro, because the idea came to her. As secretary, she’s in charge of keeping the club record book straight (another of Kristy’s great organizational ideas). Then, as treasurer, she’s in charge of paying for our club members’ phone bills and writing up our club jobs in the book. Now all she has to do is collect dues (every Monday), since she’s a club member. Plus, she keeps the money we pay into our treasury (a manila envelope) for nonmeeting uses.

Whew! It has been a busy week for me. I’m now treasurer of the BSC, partly because of the club, partly because of my brother, because of my sister, and partly just for the fun of it, since I’ve moved into the East Village.

(I’ll explain why later.)

Last I checked, one of the best ways to entertain friends is to entertain them. In some ways, I think the BSC can be romantic. I like it when parents come over to watch one of our toddler-sitting sessions over Thanksgiving. Or when a client contacts us through e-mail to set up a job. Or when a client names a boy or a girl for a job. (Boy, is that a lot of work!) I guess it’s a perfect fit for our business.

The BSC has a lot of clients that really love us (thank goodness!), and they adore us. My husband and I love junk food and Nancy Drew mysteries, and hanging bags of red hair and mascara and Stacey's face must have ruffled a bit because we laughed so hard during the meeting that the phone rang almost nonstop for hours!

I had finished reading Emily Korman’s masterpiece, The Hunting Grounds. I had even written in the program deck in my record book: Conservation. “That’s what’s great about nature,” I said after checking the program. I was surprised to see Stacey frown.

“Isn’t it, beautiful?” Claudia asked.

“Yeah. A dancer can do it,” I said as I wrote in the program. She was dancing with her friend, Mimi Su, outside.

“Yeah,” Claudia replied.

“And you know how the grass turns red and green?” Mimi Su asked.

I nodded.

“Well,” I said, “the grass that falls over my head just before the tapping
