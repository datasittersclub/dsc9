 at a mall in New York City." But she was talking about a club I used to attend called the Baby-sitters Club. That was when I fell behind in my studies and my algebra homework and my classes in the evenings, when I tried to make phone calls, and when I realized that I wasn't too sure about all the other things besides math.

Kristy always treated us like sisters. I always made her feel even more special by saying that she and I are the oldest people in the club.

Mary Anne Spier was my only other best friend, and she and I looked like sisters. But Mary Anne and I were the two best friends in the entire world. We're the same age (almost five), have the same hair color, we both have brown eyes, and we both have brown skin, just like mine. And Mary Anne and I are pretty different, too. But I guess the similarities end there.

Okay, I should say that the world is different, right? Well, not exactly. That's because our parents aren't divorced, and we're actually stepsisters. We're very different. Mary Anne lives with her dad (although, Mary Anne prefers to call him Charlie) and her mom (who is divorced). She's not a huge fan of the Big Apple (which is about as far from Manhattan as you can get), and she's not a fan of Stoneybrook (which is very far from Stoneybrook). But her mom is a big baby-sitter. While Mary Anne and I were at it, I heard about the new baby-sitting business in Stamford. That's right across town. When I got here, the Stamford Mall was going to be empty for two weeks. What would be the problem? We were going to have to pay someone to baby-sit, and we needed a guy already available. So I called Charlie to arrange. (Yes, I mean we already arranged!) He arrived right away. A few minutes later he called to tell us he could take three of us. A really cool idea, because we went with a boy we already knew.

Our first client, David Michael, is totally cool. He's from New Jersey, and he's the oldest kid in our class. We told him we wanted him to sit for a few kids, then I went in and asked him if he wanted two-three-five, which he was. I didn't really have any family to replace him, but he didn't sound too pleased.

When David Michael came along, he wasn't as busy as he is with math. But by then my feelings about him had changed. He was happy for us to sit for a couple of kids, which is what I hope we will do for David Michael.<|endoftext|>
“Oh, my lord, this must be great!” Claudia shouted as she ran up the stairs. “Our club meeting is almost here”

The clock clicked to 5:30. A group of seven members (officially, club members) had gathered for a meeting of the Baby-sitters Club in Claudia's bedroom. Claudia, Kristy, Mary Anne, and I have to admit, we were all very excited.”

“Who will start the meeting?” Stacey McGill asked.

Claudia shook her head. “I’m not sure yet, but I might consider starting the Baby-sitters Club later.”

The BSC was a group of friends formed in Kristy’s house back in seventh grade. Kristy and I had grown up in a small room in her house. Before school, we were the only friends in my school. She’d been a good friend to her father and stepmother when she was younger, but then things got a little rough for her. She had to spend a lot of time alone with Kristy’s father, who tried to spend a lot of time with his mother. Then, when the divorce went away, Kristy’s mom came back to life with her mom and with her father. Now, the only stepsiblings are Claudia, her mom, Mary Anne, Dawn, and her younger sister, Jessica.

Claudia’s house is next to Kristy’s, and we’re all pretty independent. That’s why in high school she and Kristy were practically best friends. (I’m sure when she is back in California she doesn’t want that.) But soon you’d recognize her. She’s small and compact and very sophisticated. Also beautiful. You just never know.

The BSC is the perfect group for one thing: meetings. We’re all good friends. We even have a softball team.

Our clients know us and love us. Why? Because we’re the only club
