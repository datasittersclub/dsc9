 used her ears and she always stays on time. She loves to talk about everything from her health to her dog, Astrid. (She's our special puppy.) Claudia will be in the sitting room writing down her thoughts.

Claudia and Kristy were friends as babies back when they were still babies. But their lives have changed completely. Kristy became a professional musician. (I mean, she's a talented musician too, too.) She's taken ballet lessons and danced in some of the most amazing shows I've ever seen. And Claud is best friends with Mary Anne Spier, the BSC's two best friends. They've known each other since they were very little.

In fact, Mary Anne and Claud have become our stepsisters.

They don't talk about much other than sports. Claud is the oldest kid in her family, though her brothers live in small-town BSC headquarters. She has eight younger brothers and sisters. And you know what? Claudia's mom died when Mary Anne was a baby, and Claudia was raised by her dad. His company, Kishi Rodak, was a success when she was very little. When she was in seventh grade, the Japanese orphanage had closed down. Now her dad lives in Manhattan, with his other wife. Mary Anne and Claud have become stepsisters, and they both have pets.

Mary Anne's family has changed a lot. She moved here from Long Island, which is in the city. Her father also moved out of the city because his job as sales and use manager for a publishing house in New York City had changed. He also remarried, to an awesome woman who happens to be Dawn Schafer's former boyfriend, Robert Brewster (yes, that kind of name is Stacey McGill). Mr. McGill had already moved back to New York with Dawn, but he had already married Dawn's mom. Mary Anne moved here because she loves California and doesn't want to miss Bradford Court.

Mary Anne comes to our meetings because she has a brother and sister, two kids of her own with their parents, and two boyfriends. She's cool with them, too. She gets to wear the pinkest outfits, but doesn't let it bother her. She's softspoken and cool as a silk bed.

"What about the meeting tomorrow afternoon?" I asked her with a concerned expression on her face. Claud was sitting on the carpet, reading an old envelope next to a bag of chips, next to a box of popcorn.

Claudia gave it a quick pat on the back and sat forward, looking like a model. "How about if you come in and sit and watch from the outside while the SMS kids run around. We can coach a little kids' activity when the phone rings to tutor the kids about English and math. I'll take it."

I watched the others arrive at the house from their jobs in their families before I went. The kids were already dressed and running around with their mom and dad, so I didn't see much of them. But I noticed that there were some girls present for the BSC treasurer, which was Dawn’s usual job. Dawn took the job, although she’d replaced Mallory as the only one of us who ad-libbed her. “I can’t do it," she remarked, looking worriedly at the digital clock reading 5:26 P.M. "I’ll have to take it by SDS.”

“No problem,” said Dawn. “All right. Let’s start.” (SDS is the California Day League, a softball team for all sports talk shows.)

A couple of our other members are our junior officers, Kristy. They’re in sixth grade, although most of them are in eighth grade. They’re in Kristy’s absolute best 5th grade.

“It’s okay,” groaned Kristy. “I still have time.” She took her usual seat, Dawn, Kristy, and me, and gave us addresses and number plates. “Bye-bye, everybody!” she said. We all groaned at the same time.

“Okay, then. It is your duty to fill in, Kristy,” I said. “To write in the September issue of the September issue of the September issue of the September issue of the October issue of the October issue of the October issue of the October issue of the September issue of the October … October would be a good day to start.”

“How about,” Claudia suggested, “if only one of us could be free to take some extra sitting time each day?”

“Yup,” Kristy agreed. “I would just as easily take on any one of
