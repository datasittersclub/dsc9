’ve made a nice dress and it’s gorgeous, it’d make a big party — and it is.

I’ll admit that the best thing about my ballet class is the attention it receives. I feel that way just about anywhere I go, and this is a great feeling! I spend all day worrying that I’m going to miss classes because it takes two whole days to get home from school! But I also know that the rest of the time I go to bed hungry every night. As Mary Anne would say, “Life, what if I miss one class?”

Mary Anne is the only BSC member I know who is a little more mature than I am. She’s not shy about it — she’s very sensitive. When I was younger, I took really good lessons and she’d joined my math team. (Her parents do call me, however, and I guess I don’t really care to bother.)

Mary Anne comes from a huge family. Her dad is a millionaire, and she has to prove that she’d been raising money this way and that way — that’s what she loves about me. She takes care of herself as best she can, but when she’s sick or in trouble she cries a little. Sometimes she gets all upset. She’s the only person in the room full of calm.

I can see Mary Anne. Her face is so sad. She says she’d die if she were a cat.

The club meets after a meeting is over and everybody has arrived. Everyone has dark brown hair and eyes. We call them “boys” because they’re more feminine than the rest of us.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club!” Jessi and I greeted each other as the clock turned to five-thirty.

“Hi, Abby!” I said to Mary Anne. “You have some work to do … Oh, thanks a lot. I’ll take care of it.” I went right over to Jessi (her mother’s boyfriend) and kissed him three times on each of his lips.

“Thanks …” I said in confusion. “We’re not free until five-thirty.” If I hadn’t told Jessi we were getting married, it very likely would have happened later.

“Very nice.” Jessi and Abby made good looks at each other. One of their looks might have been a pillow fight.

“I’m going to buy a ticket to a meeting at Five Towns Road and show Jessi and Rosie —” Jessi was saying. She was wearing her usual clothes: jeans, running shoes, and a turtleneck. She had a bright blue turtleneck and black overalls, and black boots, a flared brimmed dress shirt, plus matching black, black hair and white earrings. She didn’t wear glasses. Sometimes, as Kristy said, the glasses can give you a sense of what it like. She just doesn’t look good at night.

Jessi has dark brown eyes, and blue eyes and curly, brown hair. She has a sweet, friendly personality. She wants to be a writer and an illustrator of children’s books when she grows up.

One thing that Jessi has great ideas about is writing and illustrating. You could always make entries in the BSC notebook and make up terrific stories. But she likes kids, so she does what you do (or don’t do) well and gets along pretty well with kids.

Jessi also loves to read — she’s good at it, not that she’s a terrible student. She does a great disservice to her older sister, who, like Jessi, is a genius.

One of the nice things about Jessi and Abby is that they’re the same height, they’re short, and they are both pretty different from each other. They both wear things that are a little too casual, like jeans or turtleneck sweaters or T-shirts that are too short. They both look good together, though, and especially if they can’t look away.

Here’s the big surprise for me. I couldn’t do a BSC picture without getting jealous. I was staring at Jessi.

I had thought Abby had gone into a sweat. I was grinning at her. I didn’t think Jessi deserved it; I thought she was just really looking for a sitter.

I was a little nervous, too. I’d hoped she was still smiling. I thought she was about to cry at someone’s laughing at
