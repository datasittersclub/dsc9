 with us, and they are all eleven, or else they aren't.

Kristy is fun. No, she's not a math whiz, but she is a good leader. She has great ideas, and she manages to look her best. For instance, today she and Claudia were all in charge of pouring out chocolate from a vat of Milk Kool-aid. "Mmmph, mmmm." Stacey McGill, our treasurer, was on the floor munching away. I saw her arms giggle as she passed out.

"You look fine," Kristy had said in a singsong voice, when she and Claudia were discussing tomorrow. "I think you're doing great today."

Stacey's a good worker. She enjoys her job. One of the reasons she is such a good worker is that she is an only child. Her parents are strict and she has to stay on time. (A lot of families have trouble with that.) Kristy gives Stacey and her two older brothers, Charlie and Sam, an extra B. (The McGills aren't thrilled about this — except for Mary Anne, who wasn’t thrilled.) When the BSC was formed, Stacey had to pay dues every Monday. It was hard for her not to. She has a million different jobs, but she always gets the biggest payouts. That’s why I like her so much. And the most popular BSC members are Claudia and Dawn. (I said before that Dawn is really, really cool. She’s the Honorary BSC Member, and she also happens to have an amazing new set of cutlery. She and Kristy used to make up, Claudia, and I were the original two BSC members. Now, I’d have to say I’m much less so then.)

Anyway, Dawn is very athletic. She makes tons of noise, although she doesn’t seem to like it. I’ve seen her wear her hair up or backward, or stick her toe into some kind of sock. That kind of stuff, combined with her big mouth and big opinion, makes Dawn fun to sit for.

Oh, one sad thing. I don’t know the full story about Dawn. Her mother died in a car accident when she was a baby. And Dawn is very sensitive. I mean, pretty, and she’s very romantic. I think her father was really mean to her when she was a kid. Mr. Spier was still in California when her parents moved him back to New York. He did have Dawn’s older sister, Sharon, and their child, Jeff, and he also had Dawn’s younger brother, David Michael.

Dawn moved to Stoneybrook when she was nine and we lived in Stoneybrook until she was grown, but she lived in California at the time. And guess what? She lives in a mansion! She actually has a room of her own, because she lives there with Dawn and her father. (She doesn’t like the fact that she and Mary Anne live in California, either. It’s kind of strange to me.)

I like Dawn because she is a good friend, like me; except she doesn’t eat meat or sweets. She also doesn’t go to SMS (Squirt and Fish’s lunch), and she always wears her baseball cap with the football team on it.

As I said, Stacey has brown hair, freckles, and beards. She’s very blonde, and she’s really energetic. Stacey is also into health food and is one of the main reasons she’s on the BSC. Her style is more “healthy” than Stacey’s. Stacey does a terrific job on the team. She’s very organized and looks great in bright colors — because she’s from New York City.

Stacey is also an incredibly cool dresser — a lot of casual clothes have this sort of effect, even in New York City. I mean, it’s stunning — Stacey dresses it up. And fashion magazines keep a big stock of her cool stuff in our rooms. In fact, I started collecting entries in the BSC notebook, but now I have to look up to Claudia at least once a week. I bet some of the entries will be pretty cool.

Stacey is our treasurer, which means she collects dues every Monday. We use our dues to pay for things, and to pay Charlie who drives Kristy to and from meetings and to the movies (or whatever). This is a real pain sometimes. Stacey has diabetes, which means her body doesn’t process sugar properly. She has to take herself to Claudia's clinic every Monday. For the BSC — which happens anyway because of Stacey’s diabetes —
