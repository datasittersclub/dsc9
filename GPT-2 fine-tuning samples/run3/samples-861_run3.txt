 week, and it just proves what you already know. Her new haircut is sleek and clear, and her smile, even though it's still summery, is scarier than the frosty jasmine from years past.

You see, Dawn Schafer grew up in Palo City, California, and her family moved to Stoneybrook when her father was transferred there for a while. But then Mrs. Schafer got sick and had to move back to California to be with her younger brother. (Luckily for Dawn, she was able to take Mr. Spier and Mr. Schafer ’s two kids with her.)

When she moved, Dawn went to California for good. Her parents there are divorced and her dad lives in the city. Dawn likes health food and health living very much. She adores horse stories, and there are some funny ghost stories in the family, too. Dawn’s grandmother is divorced from Mr. Spier because her family split. That brings us to Mary Anne and Dawn. Mary Anne is the secretary of the club. She keeps the record book in a nice, clear place, and she’ll probably get a job someday.

The only other member of the club who is absent from this timeline is Logan Bruno. He wasn’t at the meeting, as usual, but his job usually consists of providing snacks for club members.

I wonder how he did without her help. I’m sure he was extremely hungry and used the phone very much as he talked on, trying to find a sitter. His friends could tell that he was desperate.

I wonder how Dawn did her hair without being bothered. It’s so dark and white and huge it’s almost white. Dawn is tall and thin. She’s the longest blonde, and she has brown eyes and brown skin and is dressed in absolutely fabulous — if slightly over-the-top — clothes.

I think that on some level Dawn is shy. She’s not particularly interested in boys. She’s very self-assured and doesn't care as much as she tries to. Dawn’s jeans are the clear kind, so you never notice. She doesn’t care as much as most guys I know, but she doesn’t care a bit about them in the least — at least not in the way she dresses.

Another thing that bothers Dawn about boys is that her dad died when she was nine. She doesn’t want him around anymore because she has a pretty cool haircut and, although she has a cute look, she’s not as pretty as the rest of her class. (That’s sad, because Dawn is very pretty.) Dawn’s mom died when she was young, and her dad raised Dawn all alone ever since. She’s had a great life — a good job at a school she never attended, a home here in Stoneybrook — but I really admire Dawn’s talent, determination, and straight-laced.

Shannon Kilbourne, who is in sixth grade at Stoneybrook High School, is the first BSC member to have a steady boyfriend. He’s kind of cute, but she wouldn’t exactly call him a guy. Shannon’s short, with brown hair and brown eyes and her brown skin and her dark brown hair (she’s Japanese-American).

Shannon is the treasurer of the BSC and, as I mentioned before, the only one with the ability to spend money. That’s because she’s the only one in the club who has never, ever gotten sick or in a hospital. She just keeps collecting it.

No one goofs off or breaks rules with money in her treasury. (For a while, that was a problem because the treasury was full of stale money. Now there’s a place where we can stash it.) The treasury isn’t just for two items; it’s also full of alternate items for special events or dues. So Shannon would be a good alternate for a BSC meeting, especially if we need a sitter for a special event.

You need a treasury to pay our expenses like supply chain management. Right now, Stacey has taken the same route as I did. She keeps the treasury as low as possible, so as not to overcharge it. She also collects dues each week. That’s easy for her because she’s the only one of us who actually uses the treasury. No one else does.

The club uses the treasury to pay Charlie Thomas (one of our associate members) to drive his two older brothers (Jeff and Ryan) to meetings now and for other incidental reasons. The treasury is just a little red book. We use it to keep track of expenses, such as our phone bill and dues money (the club dues are for the
