 anyway, Mary Anne was probably a little worried about her looks, especially her hair. But she kept on smiling, all those colors.

Marnie, Mary Anne, Mary Anne. I didn't want her to look a little boyish around here, I wanted them to be more sophisticated. (Maybe they should wear hats.)

Jessi and Claire had to be very careful about their outfits. They were usually braided leggings. If something looks out of place in one ear, you know it’s because somebody else might have been wearing that earlobe. Luckily, the clothes were still clean, neat, and in keeping with Mary Anne’s style.

My hair was the other issue. It often gets caught in my hair. That’s because it’s the same length as mine, which is why I had to have braided it in braided leggings. (Claire had a pretty big stash of leggings, too. She had to cut them down to length, though.)

But the BSC was all good to me. We were so organized. We started out by saying good-byes, which is how it sounds in a meeting. Today was a different story.

Today was not a sad one. I had to give a lot of credit to everyone. I was the one with the phone, and all of us were the official treasurer of the club. We were the parents, and we were supposed to be there to support us (one-on-one). On the other hand, it was time for this meeting of the Baby-sitters Club (which is what it is really like).

I closed the door behind me. Stacey, Jessi, and I were all perched on the edge of the bed, looking bored. “I’ve seen the ads for Dove and Milk and Dawn and all those junk food commercials on TV.” I took a breath and said, “Well, I hope the money comes through. I don’t have any more money to spend.”

Our parents looked really tired.

“Well, they’re just getting used to life,” Jessi said. She paused and looked at me, then said, “Okay, well, I’ll have to figure that out with my brother’s probation counselor, Watson Brewer, then.”

Mary Anne picked up her fork. “Okay, good. Let’s hope not.”

“Good,” I said, leaning forward in the chair. It was the last day of school.

We were all just getting ready to leave. The phone clicked, and I closed the door behind me. (I had to ask my parents, who really don’t want me to go home without paying a dime, but who really want to spend the night at Claudia’s, anyway.)

We sat down across from Claudia, listening to her explain the meaning of all the snacks she was getting to eat. We were so impressed with the quality of the food and her determination to make sure that nobody had hurt her after all that stuff, that we cracked up at her. We also said our sympathies to the friends and families who had been with Claudia and us.

“This is going to cost you, Kristy,” Claudia said, her voice hoarse. “I mean, maybe you aren’t paying any attention to what Claudia has to say right now.”

“Well, I don’t know.” I paused, thinking about the price of the popcorn. She looked so confused I almost let her finish.

“You have to make a million dollars.”

“Fool’s bargain,” Claudia replied, looking as confused as any of us was.

“What?” “What did you just say?”

“I mean, what exactly was the price?”

“The money's going to Claudia,” Mary Anne pointed out. “Let’s have a little go at getting the popcorn.”

I felt great about being Claudia’s baby. Now that I was free, I knew that had to be one of the best times of my life.

“What’s going on?” asked Mary Anne as she hung up the phone.

“A lot of people have been asking about the price of popcorn, and I think the fact that everybody is making a million dollars is sort of a joke. What’s going on?”

“A lot.” I shook my head. “I mean, maybe they’re making a million dollars because of the commercials.”
