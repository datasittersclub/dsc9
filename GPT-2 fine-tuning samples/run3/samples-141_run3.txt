She said that she is the president of the BSC because of a personal passion for fashion, which I think you could call her obsession.

I don't mean to be a snarky mouth, but I think she means you. I haven't seen her in weeks — but I think she misses us all a lot.

That night, the phone started ringing just before 5:25, because Dawn’s been missing for seven months! Dawn is an eight-year-old little sister. She’s in the sixth grade, and her dad works extra hours for her. He’s very generous and just sometimes lets Dawn sit for free. On Thursdays, she’s taking ballet classes or performing on her own. For the seventh and final time, she’d gone off to California for school and Dawn’s parents gave her the choice — either move or stay.

Or it could be on the road, and Dawn’s dad decides to decide. She’ll move back to California and spend more time with her family. Or, as she is writing this, on the way home alone.

We’ve kept an open mind, since she’s coming back, but it seems she’d prefer going home. I know she’ll probably be more relaxed, like when she was in seventh grade again.

She said she’d like to play for a while, to play with some new friends and family, but that was just not happening yet.

Then, she said:

"It’s a good idea to spend a night in the woods."

I’m a little embarrassed to introduce myself and I told Kristy how much I love California. I’m glad she’s free, because my life in California has been great. It’s been a while since I’ve gone away (my dad’s new town since he’s driving me), but I guess California will always have a memory of me.

When I’d mentioned Dawn, she started kissing my cheeks and turning her head to the left, toward her bedroom. She slid her hands across my legs, and Mary Anne Spier and Shannon Kilbourne kissed my face again. We held each other. And then Mary Anne leaned back, opened her arms, and pulled Dawn into her arms.

I couldn’t believe how much we kissed — and we made love. It was a good feeling. Then Mary Anne’s hands moved up over and over again, trying to create a kiss between Dawn and Dawn. Then Dawn had the biggest hand on her, feeling the love. Dawn’s hand moved over my shoulder, and Mary Anne felt the love. It’s so soft, and perfect. (If you’re thinking too much about the way Dawn looked at me, just watch how quickly Mary Anne moved from looking at me to kissing me. I did a little planning to decide.) (Mary Anne gave Dawn permission to keep both hands on her, and I adjusted my glasses.)

Then we went back to the kitchen. Mary Anne leaned forward on the bed, and I leaned forward on her lap. I was getting so wet that I felt like I was having sex with my father, and he really meant it.

Dawn was really looking forward to it. But then she said something awful, and I said, "I don’t know what." Then she told Mary Anne it was Monday. It’s a lot of time off for someone — especially someone who has never been with anyone.

I remember thinking, Wow, this is really exciting. Can I go to the movies? Can I go to the BSC meetings? Will you bring me some kind of food or something? I don’t need a movie.

"I don’t know anything that’s different about California. The mountains just look great, and the city, too," said Mary Anne. (She can always manage to make a good habit of staying in her room, though.)

The next day Dawn and I were at a movie festival with Shannon and Jessi. Jessi is an associate director; Dawn is an associate director. They were in the festival for a picture shoot they were doing. Dawn and I were holding hands and talking — and Dawn was getting more and more embarrassed. (I mean, we were just having fun.)

We all laughed.

Mary Anne said, "Well, I think she’d be a good associate director if she had to keep her schedule as clear as possible."

"That’s because Mary Anne’s boyfriend is Vanessa Mallory, who is an associate director. She doesn’t take over the job and takes over responsibility at night, unless it’s for her own own family
