 on the phone.

That night I took Mrs. Winsor back to sleep. She woke up right after with a fever, which she went to the hospital for emergency medical treatment. She also had to watch her hair as best she could to make sure she didn't get a cut. The symptoms were pretty clear, but later in the week, I'd start to feel a little tired. Suddenly I was thinking about how best to spend the rest of the summer with my brother. After all the work we'd been doing together, where it’s fun for his little brother, what with spending Christmas or Hanukkah and holidays here and there, it made sense for me to try different things. At the very least, I should try to do some more sports.

The next day I did some planning for what I’d do with my father and Lucy, since my parents were divorced and my dad still lived in Stoneybrook. I also asked Mrs. Winsor to have Dawn with me for a little while. I thought all my friends should join them, since I’d have a job to take care of in case I left or went away to school. I could go about my business as usual by myself, without having to make any other decisions.

But all of this was over, and I began to worry that sometimes Dawn would get jealous of my good looks. (She does have good looks, though. Dawn is a really good dresser.)

Well, as I mentioned before, I didn’t have a perfect body. Dawn, on the other hand, has a pretty body that I envy. In fact, I was thinking about Dawn one day when seeing a sketch of Kristy in jeans looked like a recipe for disaster. That’s when I began to hate her, even though I had watched her grow up in a nice, normal household. She had gotten used to this extra-realistic clothes, to the point where I could see she was not one of those kids. I pictured Dawn with a wild-haired, blonde, strong-willed kid with glasses and a southern accent.

I didn’t think my aunt, who used to live next door. But in my mind, her family looked ordinary. My aunt was on the big, strong side, though, and not a high-end mansion like Momo had. (I was thinking, Why did she want to move to Stoneybrook, when there were other, more fashionable parents??) I pictured me with a New Yorker girl with all this junk food on her plate.

“Dawn,” Mrs. Winsor was saying, “You can’t change Dawn’s looks and she’s not going anywhere. She’s going to get tons of attention in Stoneybrook. She’s very smart and has probably the best spelling in the entire eighth grade.”

“You really like her,” I explained. My aunt’s high IQ made her a favorite of smart people.

“I like her very much too,” Mrs. Winsor said, “because she’s got nice short brown hair. You get to dress with her whenever you want to.” She didn’t say that she hated her younger sister, Janine the Genius, but it made us all smile. Even my best friend, Mary Anne the Fashion Witch, said that Dawn was cute and adorable. Even Stacey McGill, who was studying early and was just beginning her evening at the bar, said that she looked terrific.

But the happiest day of my whole college career was on the last day of school. As I walked into my room, I heard a phone ring. It was my brother David Michael ringing every other number. He was just calling to say he was going to visit his father in Stamford, CT. I answered the phone, and it was Mrs. Winsor, Claudia Kishi, and Dawn Schafer.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club!” I heard them say as I entered the room. “We are going to go over some more of our business, or …”

“I have some news.” I answered as best I could. “I’ve had a stroke. I wish I could talk to my best friend, but I don’t. She needs someone to watch for when she walks into a room and the stroke progresses. Any news on that?”

Mrs. Winsor laughed. “I wouldn’t want to miss this chance to be with someone my close friends might be around, unless Mrs. Winsor wants to be with her.”

“I have to check —” I pointed to the clock and clicked my tongue. “It can never be 5:31. Mrs. Winsor
