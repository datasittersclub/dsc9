 her mom.

"A week from now?" Mal asked, reaching for the phone.

Kristy shook her head sadly. "I have plans for the coming week."

Mary Anne was now sitting cross-legged on the bed, looking like a real, live bear. I couldn't help smiling at her. She’s adorable. She’s smart, but she’s also an organizer, like Kristy. And not just any organized kid. Kristy loves having a group of people working together on a day.

Another thing that makes Mary Anne cute is that she also happens to be the treasurer. The math guy for the club is Bart Taylor. He’s great about sitting for the kids, and he’s also a whiz at math. So she gets to collect dues each Monday and put the money in a manila envelope. It goes to something involving an organization such as the BSC or Young Authors Club. It’s a good way to pay for things such as Claud’s phone bill and to contribute to the treasury. It’s kind of a pain to find an item for Kid-Kit (Kid-sit kits) just yet, though.

Mary Anne has long brown hair and doesn’t care much about what other people think. We do talk a lot. And she is very sensitive. I suppose her father wouldn’t be that concerned about raising a little kid on his own.

The club meets in Claudia Kishi’s room every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty until six. During that time parents can call to set up sitting assignments. They still have plenty of time to plan.

While I was waiting on my turn, which was as far as Claud’s clock went, the phone rang and a second number was assigned. That was how our club got started.

We were still sitting there, half an hour late. But we had a lot of business then, because we were having a great time.<|endoftext|>
Kristy, Claudia, and I were walking down the street from my house, in Claudia Kishi’s gorgeous ritzy neighborhood. We looked up her street in the dictionary. I watched her draw lines along a wooded area in the wall that had been covered with posters, pictures, and advertising. Even her earrings, which were small, round earrings, were included in the jewelry shop. Kristy was the one who set the idea for the BSC, and I was hoping she would join it. I was wrong. I was the club president, and I was the alternate officer.

At first I didn’t like the job. The job was weird. I was the club treasurer, and I knew that every Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I would have to collect dues from the client’s friends during that meeting. But the thought was just too good to resist. We were all tired of this nonsense. It was bad enough that some people used to collect dues on weeknights, but now we each had to give it to keep up the club. Wouldn’t it be better if we just kept doing it? I was still early in seventh grade and not used to collecting from my parents, but the idea had already occurred to me. I made up a few stories about how we could solve math problems at my school and then advertised it in a newspaper. I was still waiting for my parents to let me get my ears pierced, but now I knew how to turn on my ears and open up my nose.

I sat at Claudia’s (on either side of Claud) and listened to music that made my head spin. I heard her make suggestions, but I didn’t pay attention. Then suddenly I heard Mr. Schafer call one of his old high school friends to say that it was time to move out of town. Then suddenly. I stopped caring. I thought about all my friends’ names and addresses. I wanted to stay in Stoneybrook, but I didn’t know where to begin. I just knew that if I didn’t move soon, we wouldn’t have lots of friends.

So I did some searching and found that “Kristy Thomas is the most adorable girl in the world.” She’s the only one in the club who can truly be described as adorable. And her family is not only exotic, but super, super big. (Also, since Claudia lives right next door to Mary Anne, they have their own bedroom!)

Kristy’s dad died when she was a baby. Kristy’s mom died when Kristy was just a baby. How could it be possible that Mr. Thomas couldn’t let go of a little girl? It seemed as if everything might just fall into place one day, and
