======== SAMPLE 1 ========
uring all the things we’ve discussed, so here goes.

1. The Baby-sitters Club (that’s how I’m referred to — you hear me right now, colloquially, “Oh, the Baby-sitters Club is an organized group.” The BSC, by the way, is an organized group that’s been going along, like a club, but its members are regular baby-sitters.)

2. The Bakers Organization. Well, the BLC is the main business, so the other jobs are all for it, too.

The club’s many functions are the same as regular meetings. They’re for a special audience: We, the parents.

We have a parent meeting, where we try to explain what happened at our meetings. (The BSC has two junior members, Claire and Byron.) We also have zoos (elefants and zoosies) and clubs and, finally, mysteries and plays performed in secret.

There’s a dentist appointment we attend every Monday, a special child care meeting, where we meet three times a week to discuss new mysteries or plays — and there’s a special art lesson. And then, of course, there’s the club meeting.

As you can see, we are very different from one another.

Claire is eight. She thinks she is eleven, but she’s not. She likes ballet and can’t dance, although she’s doing a lot of things that are not ballet. Her mother doesn’t approve of her so she keeps her little sister (Mal) out of school and she thinks her dad’s a whiny snob. I think the twins situation would work if they lived in California.

Let’s see. Can a girl in seventh grade, like Kristy, decide what she is supposed to wear? A chino shirt, a leopard shirt, a sweater, and a floral print overall cap with a clear print with a white stripe all over? Yes! She could choose from a huge collection of clothes. Not only could she dress in her own way, she could make her own jewelry. I don’t know why she would ask for a million dollars, but why should she have to give herself daily injections of something other than paracetamol?

Okay, okay, I get that feeling. If Stacey were in seventh grade, she’d want to eat healthier, and she could, but she could’t give her body the sugar it needs to. Stacey has diabetes. It makes her condition worse; she has to stay on a strict, calorie-counting, no-sweets diet (like Kristy) and stay on a strict, no-dinner diet (like Claudia). (And while she is absolutely gorgeous, the rest of us aren’t. We wear our blonde hair, on which we’ve painted our initials J, and on which we’d chipped in a few places.) The only boy in Stacey’s family who doesn’t have a steady job is Charlie. He’s ten years old, and his dad works hard for little Charlie, which is why he’s allowed to drive us there. Charlie does have a baby brother named Buddy (Watson), and he’s a good kid who really bounces back from his tough life.

That afternoon, as we were clearing the living room of the junk food, Claudia was on the verge of saying, “Mal says it would be great if Mrs. McGill saw to it her youngest child eating healthily.”

“Dawn,” said Logan, interrupting, as Mary Anne, who was listening, jumped up.

Dawn isn’t the only girl interested in health food. Mary Anne thinks it’s hilarious. Mary Anne and Kristy are the ones who want to experiment with something called ‘pork poo.’ They’re the two junior members only.

Claudia, who has a younger sister and a bigger one (and a smaller one) in town, was a little alarmed. Papadakis was teasing her. I think the baby boogers are going to fight!

“Dawn?” Mary Anne said.

“Uh-oh,” said Claudia. “I didn’t think so.”

Claudia rolled her eyes at Dawn. She felt bad for Dawn. She’s the only member of the club who was extra corny for a while, but now she’s accepted it better. And guess what? Dawn didn’t even think of it. She actually wanted to eat health food. She’s been taking good care
