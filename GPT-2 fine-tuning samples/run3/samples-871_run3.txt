======== SAMPLE 1 ========
�s house on Bradford Court. Her stepfather, Watson Brewer, is, as you might have guessed, Richard Spier, who happens to be a millionaire. (Mary Anne misses him terribly.) I can relate to the fact that he makes a decent living doing what he does — buy these great old brown paper bags that he keeps for us, hectic, boring life-size portraits of his children. He's also got real kids, and we adore them. Now the kids are getting old fast, and the Brewers are trying hard to keep them full. But I really miss Richard. At least he's very shy.

Not long ago, I started a baby-sitting group called the We Kids Club. The name confers special status on me. I don't mean that my friends and neighbors are jerks or that I have to hide behind good friends or anything. I mean that my reputation as such comes to life when someone sees me when she likes. That's Mary Anne, our secretary, our treasurer, and she's the one who gets to choose the rules and regulations (like where and the time) and pay dues (which is totally fair).

How does Mary Anne handle those rules? She tries to be super-cis, and she's a whirlwind. In addition to meeting our meeting times and scheduling jobs, Mary Anne also "checks" Claudia's digital clock, making sure she's not late because we party. Then, at every meeting, she answers a call from the client list.

When I first realized how important it was for Mary Anne to be free to take the BSC job, I couldn't help liking her a lot. After all, Mary Anne hasn't been meeting our schedule all year.

Her best friend is Stacey McGill, another member of the BSC. Stacey grew up in New York City, which may be why we have not seen her much. She's an authentic New Yorker, with the longest, palest hair around. Her light brown skin and long, long, graceful limbs make her a wild dresser. Plus, her passion for art has always been somewhere in between New York City and Long Island, which would make her the perfect New Yorker for the BSC. She might also be the first African-American member. (She and Kristy were the first to arrive here.)

Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike, another identical pair, are junior officers in the BSC. They aren't allowed to baby-sit in the afternoons unless it's for their own families. Jessi and Mal are our junior officers, which means that they take some afternoon jobs on day days, which gives them plenty of time to baby-sit.

Like Logan and Shannon, Jessi and Mal are eleven years old and in the sixth grade, while Jessi and I are eleven and in the eighth. But Jessi and I are different ages, and I think that lots of parents are disappointed by the differences in the way they look. Jessi is beautiful, with beautiful long legs and gorgeous dark brown eyes (she's about as creative as Claudia!) who loves to read — she’s called knop-pops — and write. She has two kids from a previous marriage, a boy and a girl, from their first marriage, and she wants them to be treated like her own. Both children are older and better-formed than their parents, although Jessi has had a much better upbringing.

Mal, even though she’s shy, is the oldest kid in her family. She’s the oldest in five kids, including identical triplets. Mal loves to read, so she can write stories and tell jokes. And her family is huge, stretching from her grandmother to Watson Brewer, our family secretary. There are ten of them now, including brothers and sisters, complete with kids’ younger than thirteen. So it’s a good thing Mal likes kids, too.

I have an interesting way of thinking about my family that I cannot describe. Mallory and Jessi each live near the Lincoln Center watching play and reading while they’re at work and school. As junior officers, they can’t sit at night while I am at work. They have other commitments, though. As Mal says, "I like to read more about boys than about girls."

So maybe not everybody is thrilled to have Mal's attention-grabbing attention-grabbing attention-grabbing attention-grab. Mal cares nothing about boys. Maybe she is shy, maybe she is very sensitive, and maybe most of all, maybe most of the time she is very, very good baby-sitting.

But Mal is. She is also the most talented, the most creative person I have ever met. She is an athlete, a phenomenal ballerina who is totally gorgeous. She lives in a big apartment building on the block below New York City. Mal, who has red hair, freck
