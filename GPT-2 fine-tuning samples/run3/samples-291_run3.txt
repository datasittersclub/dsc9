 the phone during the next few minutes. We called out the members that we thought our friends who were also in the BSC should be called, and they were the best people we ever found. Kristy was the first one called because we thought of her idea and called her mom after we called her back.<|endoftext|>
Mary Anne Spier and I laughed all afternoon. But then we thought about how she used her position with the BSC to bring up Stacey after she was transferred to Connecticut. Kristy told Dawn that Stacey was going to start school again, which means she will be an associate member. She will be an associate member only if she's at school, after work, on weekends, or on holidays. (No, I didn't tell you that Stacey is not a student until I saw the BSC calendar.)

Then it hit me: Who is a student after she goes to college? What kind of a student happens during the summer at another college? That left Mary Anne with this big question: Where am I going? What was my schedule like at my previous job? I guess in a few months I could decide if I wanted to go back to school (even if it was only on the weekends or holidays) or at home during the year (even if it was in Connecticut). I'd have no idea if I'd just made a simple choice and gotten swept up in the experience.

Here were the rest of the BSC members:

First, Claudia Kishi. As secretary of the BSC, Claud is responsible for the record book, the club record book (which contains our records), and all of our schedules. For years, she had taken care of Mary Anne and my brothers at our Kid-Kits. For the last three years, we spent quite a bit of time on Kid-Kits.

Then came Kristy Thomas and Dawn Schafer. They didn't look too professional, but they were excellent baby-sitters and they always made the club better. They dressed like babies, cleaned up like babies, and made everyone happier.

I didn't want to go to the meetings, but I knew that I'd have to be at Claudia's house to watch us eat breakfast until our appointments were over. (Kristy was dressed in jeans and a turtleneck jacket, and a baseball cap pulled over her head.)

Jessi and Mallory Pike? That was the only good thing that went on in those times.<|endoftext|>
Kristy Thomas was always a good mother, but sometimes it hurts the BSC to compare her to Mary Anne Spier.

Kristy has freckles, dark eyes, and is shy and outspoken. And her bedroom is a quiet one. She has two older brothers, David Alan Spier and Sam and Charlie (Dawn doesn't come to the BSC meetings, but we always know he's there). And Mary Anne used to be so happy about what it was like to have her brothers around. But that day she said it was more like being the only one left to watch your stepbrother when you were home (and it made us cry). It's hard to believe, but just to be honest, Mary Anne's been fighting her shyness all her life.

Kristy used to live like that. Before I came to the BSC, Kristy used to be shy. At first she just ignored me and used my silence for giggles, which was a good thing since that means she'll say “everything” at me (usually). But I guess we have to keep quiet and let her know that her shyness will not come easy for the rest of us. But it's not like Kristy doesn't let her have a good time. She has a family-oriented softball team called Kristy’s Krushers that she runs. She is such a terrific baby-sitter. In fact, I almost thought that Claudia would be such a great teacher. I would have been ecstatic if Kristy won the Krushers award. No! She’s not. She’s just a really good student.

Okay. So, that’s how Kristy grew up, back when the BSC was starting to grow bigger and bigger.

I guess when I say older than Kristy, I mean more than Kristy’s siblings. In fact, Kristy’s mom died when Kristy was just a baby. Her dad was brought up by his older sister, Mary Anne. When Mary Anne met Mary Anne, they started to fall in love. For a while, they even fell in love with each other. They were not the only ones. Then, Mrs. Thomas met Dawn Schafer, and married and had a family. They moved into her big house and the family business continued to grow.

Kristy has two brothers, David Alan and Charlie. He’
