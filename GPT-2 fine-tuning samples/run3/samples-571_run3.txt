======== SAMPLE 1 ========
SC’s club on the other hand. It’s an amazing thing to do in a rainy day. We take in some of the best holiday shopping around and try to make it look like a normal week. It’s a lot easier doing some things at the office than you might think.

Luckily, Dawn is so busy with her schoolwork that she doesn’t seem to notice that her parents don’t approve of her activities. (That’s how Jessi became our honorary member.) Our club meets in Claudia’s room, so everyone is perfectly happy there. However, there are some club members we can count on to fill in when we need extra people.

First off, there are Logan, Claudia’s friend and her associate members, Stacey McGill and Claudia Kishi. Their jobs are to take in any sitting job whenever a client calls, and to dole out club jobs to Dawn and Jessi.

Last, there are Nannie, Claud’s mom and grandmother, who live in Claudia’s bedroom. They don’t use the hallway and don’t come to meetings. They’re associate members because their jobs require them to be close to sitters.

Luckily, the BSC’s hospitality needs are pretty important to us. In addition to providing snacks and healthy food, the club provides snacks and treats — such as cookies, popcorn, sugar-free soft pretzels, and Snickers bars — to clients every now and then. We can afford to let our clients know exactly what we’ve got under those rules, so that our clients know what to expect.

At this point, it’s all you can do to help us out. As I mentioned before, I’ve decided to take a trip to Washington, D.C. It’s a busy time zone, and as I mentioned before, a busy person is always a busy person. I’ll admit, I really like the Mallomars, which is why I’m taking a half-marathon for them. Mallomars kids love to take on school projects, and it’s a great way to pay dues. We pay dues every month, to help cover Claud’s transportation costs. We’re supposed to get a portion of the money back, or we’re responsible for paying it. That goes for supplies for our Kid-Kits, and sometimes, when we pay our expenses ourselves, we get to try out some new item. There are also Kid-Snapping and Snack-Laundering rules in place to keep the kids calm and calm-headed.

All that talk of having a great idea is well and good. But what if we weren’t so successful? Where would we be today?

I was thinking about that. Wouldn’t it be great if everyone had to do the same thing? Would each member start every job with different, more varied ambitions?

The idea made me very sad. I knew starting would mean running around looking for more jobs, making me look stupid, and making me want to die instead of just leave it all behind. If I didn’t figure out how to earn enough to cover all my items and keep up with Claud, my life would be miserable.

I sat down next to Mary Anne and we talked for a little bit more. It was good to hear she’d make a good friend. She’s one of the most caring people I know, and she’s probably the most supportive about anything.

She told me she misses Kristy and me, too. She also told me her new stepmother is pretty awful (especially after what happened to her mother when her father was gone).

That leaves us with three associate members — Logan, Kristy, and Stacey.

Here goes. Now let me know what you think. What would we do without my best friend?

“Hi,” said Kristy. “I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately. I want to start a meeting of my BSC.”

“Me!” I replied confidently. “No. I hate boring meetings. So, how come we have to make all these people redundant? That should be easy. Just go crazy. We can begin.”

Kristy made a note of the call and sat down next to Mary Anne. “I’ll get started, Claudia, and Mary Anne, okay?”

I couldn’t help smiling. Claudia Kishi is my best friend. She and Kristy are similar in a lot of ways, but she is also very pretty and blonde-haired. And with her blue eyes and silky, long, black hair, she’s pretty intense.
