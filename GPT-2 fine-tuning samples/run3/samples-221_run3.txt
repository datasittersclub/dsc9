 to the city. He has a girlfriend, and they're both really friendly. Her name is Abby (she's my best friend in the world), and she's been a baby-sitter in Kristy's house for the past year and a half.

Kristy, of course, has her own apartment, of course. And I don't think she's too busy to take my job on Mondays. In fact, she's the BSC's alternate officer for the year, which means she runs in for anyone who can take over the job on a Monday night. She's never left the BSC without Jessi, who is our alternate officer. We also have two associate members: Dawn and Mary Anne, who both attend Stoneybrook Day School.

The club meets the second Monday in September, at approximately 5:29.

We meet in Claudia's room because the phone is usually on time in Claudia's room at 5:30. We always come up with ideas during meetings, since most of the time we actually make a list of all of the ways to talk, which in our book includes the usual amount of sitting, eating, stretching, and other activities. We use that information to write up, in pencil or pad, short stories called BSC stories. We keep it in memory of all our club members — including one great idea that comes easy to us: We all had ideas about how to make a baby-sitter list. We were the ones with the idea. Kristy, Abby, and I were the ones who realized the list would be an amazing thing to have on hand, even though we knew it might never actually exist.

Anyway, the BSC meets in Claudia's room every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from 5:30 to 6:00. It's a good idea because it allows us to keep up with a steady number of club members on Wednesday and Friday afternoon, and on Monday afternoon when Claudia's dad is due to visit. Kristy has called us on the idea, since she hates Mondays and she's the only one of us who's free on Mondays. We're the only members of the club who have alternate jobs, which means one of us can take over for any other member of the same parent's job.

We also meet at the club's meetinghouses (where we keep the schedule of our meetings) because we're on hold when we do other things, like take phone calls and arrange for pizza and a pizza party in our front yard. Kristy and I grew up here on Bradford Court, which is in Stoneybrook. Our parents live across town, but things aren't all that different. Kristy has brown hair and brown eyes, and when she's talking, she sounds more like a businessperson than like a person. She's never been stuck fighting with someone in the kitchen, for instance. You can tell she's not a sports nut.

The BSC had a few members that didn't make it in the meetinghouse. For instance, Dawn Schafer, Kristy's best friend from high school who we call the BSC secretary, who just happens to be Kristy's grandmother. Dawn is tall, with long pale white-brown hair and brown eyes. She's really into fashion and hasn't worn any really awful clothes in awhile so far, but she hasn't looked her usual outfit — jeans, running shoes, sweats and tights — since high school.

Anyway, we're the only BSC members that can take her phone calls.

It wasn't long after those meetings was that Dawn realized she was so much more than just an associate member. She actually was a member of the club. That's because the club has four members: a junior member named Logan, a sophomore named Claudia, a member named Stacey, and a junior associate (who is the club's alternate officer) called Jessi. They're all eleven and in sixth grade, but they're alternate officers because their parents don't approve of them being allowed to sit at night on the job. So they sit at their own homes, at night, unless they're sitting for their own families, and also for their own brothers and sisters, who don't have the support of their parents. We don't allow them to be with their brothers and sisters at night, but that doesn't stop them from doing other things. Some of them don't believe the idea of having a club member sit at night for another family's baby-sitter.

Claudia, on the other hand, thinks it's a great idea. She thinks it's more convenient for the BSC to be near her when she's home, because her mother can't go straight to the doctor to find an organ donated by the Vietnamese. If the doctors are reliable, then the Vietnamese can take out a job for that infant, and that's enough money for her to buy a new backpack. (She'd love the job, but Claud thinks it'll be far
