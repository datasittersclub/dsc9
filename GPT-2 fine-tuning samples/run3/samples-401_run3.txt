 to ask me about my health. My mother wouldn’t believe it, but she couldn’t help it. So I said no thanks.

Mrs. Schafer’s reaction was almost more the reaction of the world than Mrs. Schafer had expected. She looked at me sternly and whispered, “Do you know what that’ means?” I have to admire Mrs. Schafer sometimes. I think she’s a better person about health than she’s been.”

Mrs. Schafer raised one eyebrow at me and grinned. “I like your health.”

“I like the way I dress. I don’t like the way I feel about food,” I said. I think Mrs. Schafer feels bad for eating junk food. I had only eaten healthy food for about a week, and then I started to get really sick.

“Maybe you can fix me someplace else,” Mrs. Schafer said, “and I’ll see what fits you.”

“I don’t need a dentist,” I said breathlessly. My family needs a dentist. And I know they’ll need one myself.

Our phone rang during the meeting. It was Mr. Spier and Mrs. DeWitt. I thought their dog was an old Vietnamese she had driven around with their family. I told them I’d call the dentist, but she wouldn’t budge. I gave him the appointment and he gave me a thumbs-up and I went back to Stoneybrook. I felt good. My mother was loving me and I felt I’d been treated well. But the doctor wouldn’t tell me how to perform the tests when my junk food came into contact with blood. And my diet didn’t include grains or sugar or fruits or vegetables.

This wasn’t all bad, though. Everyone seemed to be doing better. I hadn’t felt sick since I had diabetes. (Kidney problems are a part of diabetes.) The doctor told me about a couple of things about which I wasn’t sure. One was that I was growing old fast, and his opinion would have to be taken into account, especially if he was trying to care for you next month. Two is that his opinion of me was biased toward one side, toward the hamburger, and toward the hamburger. The only things that might be wrong there are what happened to some of the other things I have. I don’t know. It could have some unpleasant side-effects, but I won’t make that kind of argument again.

“My dog,” Mrs. DeWitt said. “My family has two pit bull terriers (which looks like a terrier named Tigger) and two goldfish’.” She held out her arms and I held out my legs. “Who’s going to buy the goldfish?”

“Pit bull terrier …” I said, trying to remember my name. I know the name right now. “Tigger?”

Mrs. DeWitt said her name would not make sense — Tigger’s name.

“Who’s going to buy the goldfish?” I asked. “Tigger,” Mrs. DeWitt said. “Guess.” I grabbed her wrist and tugged at her legs. (That’s Tigger, by the way, the dog of the family.) I could hear Mrs. DeWitt talking, but I didn't want to ruin her calm. I wanted to capture the moment exactly.

Mrs. DeWitt, who was already on hold longer than usual, spoke up as I stepped out of her car. There was a moment of silence. Finally, her voice dropped to a whisper. “Hello, Mrs. Kishi,” she said softly. “What’s the matter?”

Suddenly, all of a sudden I had this idea of Tigger, and I had to help Mrs. DeWitt. I was the last one in.

“Well, you know, Tigger is cute,” I said, “but you don’t have to buy him puppies. You’ve got a whole lot of these animals — goldfish, goldfish, the giant brown ones …” I looked around the room. “Isn’t that a dog?”

Mrs. DeWitt looked at me for the word. “Well, Tigger is definitely a dog.”

“Well, what do you know about?” I asked. I
