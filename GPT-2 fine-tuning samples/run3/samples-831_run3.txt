 of his friends in the BSC. It wasn’t easy, but somehow I was still able to stay positive and hold events at my house.

I’m lucky because I started a BSC informal club called the We Kids Club. That’s because we meet three days a week, from five-thirty to six, in my room. We don’t follow many rules, except that we have to be in my room at all times. (I’m the only one in the entire club who does that.) What’s nice about that — and the only one who’s ever given me the benefit of the doubt — is that we don’t make new friends the minute we meet each other. We have baby-sat for each other awhile now, and none of us really had any new friends, which would have been kind of shocking, considering that Stacey was the only other one of us with a steady baby-sitter.

So now everyone could sympathize. But it was only a meeting of seven and a half people. When the phone rang, I tried to pry open the bag of sour cream behind me. The sour cream was on the short side and tasted like lumpy old chocolate. I felt as if some kind of mass-sunken ritual were going on in my brain.

I reached for the bag. The moment I opened it, I saw that it had been carefully packed. Everything was in order. There was also an unopened box of candy bars — no cookie section, though — and two hollow Rubbermaid bracelets, each of different colors. I could feel myself grinning as I saw them.

“Mmmmm!” I said, taking the bag out of my hand. “Candy-pillows,” I argued. “Sure. You guys could make one yourself. Just measure, and set aside.”

“Candy-pillows,” Bart snapped back.

“Great,” I said with a gasp. “Two pairs of SmartWaves. Where was I?”

“Two pairs of SmartWaves,” Bart repeated. “One SmartWave, one pair of Gummi bears. Where was I?”

“One pair of Gummi bears,” I cried out. I was about to tell the world I’d left my SmartWaves in the car. “Yesss’!”

Bart’s voice sounded through my window. “You did better today,” he said.

We laughed. Our conversations often echo in my head. My job as BSC secretary is to keep order in the city. In my head, I’m the most organized person in the world. I have official title, official position, and official telephone number. I know how to code. I’m not just some bored kid with nice brown pants and loafers. School is my favorite sport. My teachers have never, ever made me dress the way I do. They make me wear the newest pair of socks (I wear the same old), use my contacts, buy my Cheetos, etc. The only time school is my only meal is if it’s tied to homework.

And when it comes to doing stuff for charity, I have no interest whatsoever in fashion. If you’re reading this far, guess what. I am a vegetarian. (That’s what my teacher thinks of as a "nonbeliever." Anybody who’s not a vegetarian would probably be a fat pig, like me, to me.) I’m so involved in school that I don’t care much what other people think. What I do care about, however, is sports. Sports is one of my least favorite hobbies, aside from football and volleyball. I don’t want to be a mean-spirited little kid with bad manners. Besides, you need fun things in school. My sister and I can’t sit down and eat anything except horse food. Besides, horse food is practically non-existent in school. Besides, all I really wanted was to do well in school. By the time I was twelve, though, I had just begun to understand some of what other students were saying — especially about the connection between satiating pleasure and adult health.

So I thought about exactly what a healthy, experienced baby-sitting job would look like. I sketched a team of sitters together, and then I talked to Mary Anne, Bart, and Claudia for an hour. I figured if I could figure out how to be a baby-sitter in a city with a big variety store, where everybody is supposed to open three different boxes each, there would be tons of business.

But the thought crossed my
