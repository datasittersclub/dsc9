What you saw on Thursday was the second of three new members. They'll be Claudia Kishi, Kristy Thomas, and Mallory Pike: two best friends with whom I have two more children. We originally planned on being a full team since Kristy was the one who got the idea for it, as well as being the youngest member of the team. She loves math. I was hoping to become a writer but now I feel I need an artistic side to me. It's just a little more artistic, but still a big deal. That said, we've been friends since I was about eight in seventh grade. We are the best friends in the entire school, right from grade five till age eleven.

Mary Anne is our alternate officer, and she's our alternate officer because she's the only one of us members without her parents. Since the BSC allows her to use her phone, she always has a BSC notebook that she shares with Claudia. We don't have a notebook, but she doesn't seem to mind.

Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike are our junior officers. They take over for Stacey. They have pale blonde hair and blue eyes. They're both eleven and in sixth grade.

Mallory grew up on Long Island, on a farm about fifteen minutes away from me. She's an awful artist. She paints or draws or draws anything and everything she wants, and then makes absolutely no money. She studies art, collects art books (she makes most of them herself), and dresses in really cool clothes from the old days (I think). She's also good friends with Mary Anne’s older sister, Janine, who’s a professional ballet dancer now. Jessi loves health food, and she feels a little sick all the time.

Mallory is our other associate member because we have to pay dues to her, plus we have to let her take afternoon jobs before she has to give us money. I think she’s a good student because she’s such a good student. But she also does an awful lot of homework. In fact, she was the first person she ever met who said she was a genius, despite being an only child.

As you can guess, Mal wants to be a baby-sitter. She’s a pretty sophisticated girl. She’s got a long black hair and she’s beautiful. But, I think, when it comes to art, she doesn’t seem interested in the looks of younger people. She wants to be a true artist.

“All right,” Mallory said, pointing to the books in her room. “My art is a matter of style. It’s the only art I like about my house. No one’s complaining about it.”

Mary Anne is the BSC secretary. She keeps track of the club business — paying dues, providing snacks, organizing our Kid-Kits, etc. — and then gives an official title to our charges. Mary Anne usually runs down every single one of us. As I told you, she’s already used to the idea of taking our job.

“Yes,” Mallory replied. Stacey McGill, who I’ve always admired as a kid, was the one who started the club, too. She is the oldest kid in her family, with brown hair and blue eyes and goes to an average high school. Mary Anne’s mom died when Mary Anne was four (she’s eight now), and her father worked hard to raise Mary Anne and her younger brothers at his mansion. Stacey’s a certified genius.

I’ll never met Claudia Kishi, though. She’s my best friend and junior officer. She’s the one who’s best friends with Kristy Thomas. Even though she is quiet, we share a sense of humor. Also we enjoy reading both Mary Anne’s and Kristy’s books.

“Let’s go,” Jessi said. Her eyes were full of tears.

When the phone rang, I could tell it was Stacey.

When that happened, I couldn’t care less. She had already called Claudia’s number (which I had at first). And I knew that it’d come from the director of a movie I planned to watch (that, by the way, is Claudia Kishi’s real name). It didn’t seem right, so I stuck to it and dialed it. That’s when Jessi went ballistic.

This time Claudia was laughing as she ran back to the phone.

“Yeah, yeah!” I exclaimed. The phone rang again, this time to Mary Anne.

“Mary Anne,” Mary Anne
