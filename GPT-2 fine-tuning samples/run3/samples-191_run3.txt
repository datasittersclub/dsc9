 was pretty cool.

Oh, I think so. So it comes to my next point. The idea of a superpowered leader comes to me a lot when I talk about this school. The Queen of the Seven Bunnies is Dawn Schafer. She's very talented. She has a passion for horseback riding, and she has the coolest idea yet: creating a club to make girls' meetings more fun. Every girl in the BSC is going to be a member, which will make it fun, too! And it's going to work. I know Dawn isn't the best student in the eighth grade anymore, but she's talented enough to take charge.

It makes me sad, because in my head, I would rather be a baby than be the baby of a good parent than be a baby mower. In the meantime, I adore my sister, Anna. She's the sort of person that takes her anger out on everybody. It would be difficult for her to take such a big step back. Her attitude is sometimes out of line with mine.

Maybe it's because I'm the only BSC member, but I've also met her brother, Thomas. And I haven't had to hide any of my feelings about him. I think he's terrific. Plus, he's always been my best friend. Our meeting was supposed to start promptly, but our schedule slipped by fast — and then this happened. We had to meet several times a week, with a few interruptions, and two days later, Dawn came in and told us that our meeting had ended.

We haven't changed much but we've gotten along just fine. Kristy is great at math, but only because she has a great sense of humor. She and me and Claudia are best friends. We can talk about anything in so many good, deep, deep ways, so far.

Kristy and I are now best friends, but now is the time for romance. If it ever happens to me, it's a happy ending.

“What’s that?” asked Stacey the moment we arrived at the meeting that afternoon.

“Oh, I’m not sure,” said Kristy. “I think I just saw you in the mirror.”

“Oh, good! Well, I guess your story was right; you looked much prettier than I did, and I had forgotten you were there,” Claudia answered.

“This’s good,” I said. “You looked much prettier than I’d remember.”

“Good,” said Kristy with a smile.

We all felt a bit better when Stacey saw the mirror with her. She began to laugh. “Why’t your birthday go on since it’s just me and you right now?”

“Because I’m going to a concert,” Kristy said with a grin.

“Oh, well,” I said, smiling. “I guess I was kind of shy when I saw you and your hair and it was the prettiest thing I’ve ever seen, and now that I think about it, it looks just so nice.”

“It’s the shortest hair in the world,” said Stacey with a wave.

“So it’s short,” added Kristy.

Kristy was laughing so hard it seemed like a roaring bonfire. She reached out.

“Claudia, you look terrific,” she greeted. “Are you up-looking?”

“I think my hair just looks good,” said Kristy, and she flipped open the door with her long, white, curved, short arms. She held out her hand for Stacey to do the same. “Good morning,” said Kristy. “I’m sorry to interrupt, but I have a question for you. How did it feel to have such a beautiful, natural hair grow right down onto it? When you first heard it?”

“Thanks!” said meekly, leaving Stace to stare at me with her blue eyes.

I knew exactly what she meant. Just when I didn’t believe her, she smiled and said, “The hair was just like this.”

The moment Claud saw Stace’s smile, she realized it. She smiled so hard she actually fell right on the spot. She was laughing so hard that it gave her a kind of heartbreak.

Jessi’s face lightened up, and the grin on her face turned to pride. The next time she saw Kristy, though, her eyes looked really big.
