 on my desk. And we each contribute to a fund-raiser for the Somalis Fund for the Somalis. So maybe it is a little strange when we are both on a rainy-day, two-and-a-half-year team, but it is.

I know I look pretty cool here, but I don’t think I’d have a job for six months. I just wanted to stick my neck out for a baby-sitter, but there are plenty of unsung heroes in every field — math, ghost-hunting, ballet — so I don’t think I’ll feel right in my hole.

Just the same, the club went into our sixth meeting — and by sixth I mean our last, in Stoneybrook. We were busy, in fact. Stacey has already danced out of the club. She’s back on the faculty. This was probably when the original idea for the Baby-sitters Club started. With Charlie — the man — I guess we were stuck. I could have been back in seventh grade, where I’m the only club member, and I’d have had to prove I was capable. But instead I went back to eighth, where I couldn’t stand up there.

And here I am, in eighth grade. It’s a lot more comfortable. I can sit at my desk, take a pencil and paper, and write in my journal. And I’m free. It’s really nice to have the freedom, even though I do not feel safe enough to go out and do anything that’s too dangerous.

We got a lot of good people back in the club, and we always stick together. My brother, Sam, got a phone call that summer from this guy named John Philip, and from the man sitting next to him, my best friend, Karen Ashley, who was going to be a Baby-sitters Club member. Her name was Mallory Pike. (That’s a great way to introduce her, since here in my neighborhood I’m surrounded by girls and it’s a pretty crowded place.) And I just knew right away that she was going to be joining the Baby-sitters Club. Karen was eleven and in seventh grade at the time. And Stacey, our treasurer, was thirteen and in sixth grade at the time. (I’m sorry, but she used to be thirteen and in sixth grade, but she’s thirteen now, too.)

So that’s the club I grew up on. If I hadn’t grown up like Karen and me, I would never have dreamed it would turn out like this. I know it took some going into high school and a lot of practice on my part to realize that I was a teenager, but from the inside I was really young. And maybe I was just too old for that stuff. I guess the best lesson in the book is this: Don’t get caught up in the way people dress. Be careful about what you wear. Be careful what you buy. Do what you read on the internet, read all the junk books you can get your hands on. You’d be able to find the latest books that you like, the latest fashion, and have the best time. And don’t expect to be called rich and famous, I swear.

Anyway, back to the original idea. That’s what the club is all about. It’s about having fun, of course. And if you can’t be fun, then maybe it’s time to move on. But don’t get me wrong. I think clubwork is fun and I have other ideas at my disposal all the time. I’m not one of those people who just go around calling people names. I happen to like having a name of my own. It’s always interesting, and you’re welcome!

But the club is not the way I thought it was going to go. I think Stacey McGill was not a good student-athlete. I believe that all of my other friends thought the same thing. I believe they were wrong, too. Stacey is a good student-athlete.

Stacey joined the club as we were about to take the alternate officer position, which means that I fill in if anyone else is absent, except for Charlie, who’s going to school here in New York City. But then, Stacey wasn’t in the club that week because she had a baby. (I know this because her parents are very upset with her.) She wasn’t in the club because her mother couldn’t decide who could baby-sit and who couldn’t, because Charlie’s so busy with his job in the BSC. That was just Stacey
