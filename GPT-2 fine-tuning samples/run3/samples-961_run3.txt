 she's on, but she never bothers to show us. She just walks in.

"Cool, that is," Claudia Kishi says now.

"Cool!" I say.

"Cool!" Stacey complains.

"Cool!" Abby complains.

"Cool!" Mal yells.

"Cool!" Claudia says, "but you guys, Mary Anne! This is some serious business!"

We all flinch.

Ribe!

And that's the BSC! That's the Baby-sitters Club. I saw that passing through my neighborhood that day.<|endoftext|>
Mary Anne Spier, who is the BSC's artistic director and who is not only sophisticated and smart, but also pretty, stepped outside the Kishis' front door. She sat cross-legged on her bed by Claudia's desk and looked at Claudia's digital clock.

"Uh-oh! Hello, my friends," she said, laughing. She reached for a phone book.

"We have something for me," Claudia said, pulling out a new book on hair redoubling after a bout of chemotherapy. "Art supplies."

Mary Anne snatched up a bag of pretzels from her dresser.

Claudia hoarsely ate one.

Mary Anne looked at Abby. "Art supplies?" she asked.

"No, but we have counselors," said Abby's sister, Shannon.

"Okay," I piped up.

"Helping with the hair."

"Helping with the redoing of the dressing room mirror," Shannon said.

Mary Anne tapped out the red carpet expert Dr. Johanssen.

We started to laugh but we also noticed Shannon's red flag. "Helping?"

"Helping with the stairs," Mal said.

"Cool," I piped up.

Mary Anne nodded.

Our meeting grew crazier and more difficult each day. Eventually, once a week I'd make the most ridiculous discovery in my life. Enter Suzi.

After we'd spent the last three days arguing about who had better go to a meeting of the Baby-sitters Club, Suzi came into the room.

I'd seen her there once or twice already, standing at the door, wearing her long, red-and-white-striped hair.

"Hi, Suzi," Suzi said, waving her hands and making a face. "Are you tired of all this?"

"Of course. But all I wanted to do was talk to you all over again and be ready to begin again."

"Yeah, that's great."

"Anyway," Suzi continued. "I just need to make sure I take everything in hand smoothly. Okay? Smooth?"

"Absolutely."

Mary Anne held up the record book.

"There's a problem," Suzi warned. "There is. Don't tell Mary Anne I left you guys back when we started."

"There was?" I asked.

Suzi was referring to the fact that, even though our club was beginning to get a little out of hand, we still needed help. We were having a hard time keeping up with new clients and, well, we needed to be extra careful about what we provided.

I sighed. "Okay, fine. We'll go straight to the meeting."

It took awhile for our club to start working its magic again. I finally managed to straighten out a client's problem and call several more times to discuss it. At least, that's how Mary Anne described my sitter. She's an excellent one, I just can't see her putting too many thought into it.

I should know. As an associate BSC member. Mary Anne is the one who follows all club rules, whether they're important or not. The last place you'd want to be at a meeting is the one who's not an associate member. Instead, you'd have to have definite commitments from the minute you enter.

One thing you'd want to know about is whether or not you'll be available to take part in a team sweat day. With so many different kinds of work, it's no surprise that Mary Anne is a lot of sweatier. Not only does she have to be prepared, she has to take good care of herself. She's a really good person, and a lot of fun. But you'd never know it by looking at her. She has really long, wavy reddish-brown hair, and she usually wears her hair pulled back in a bun (sometimes she does that at the end of the day, to stop the wind from blowing over her face).

Mary Anne's style is a bit off-kilter, but that doesn't matter. She's not a mean-spirited snob; it
