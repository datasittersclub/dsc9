======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 not like to be bothered with a club record book. I have to read everyone's entries before I make any appointments with clients. That's why I've always kept a club record book very, very close at hand.

As treasurer, I keep track of the money in our treasury, which I'll explain in a minute. The treasury is divided between the club and the treasury fund, but it doesn't have to be. The club treasury is to go toward Claudia's phone bill, to Claudia's phone bill, and to items for the Kid-Kits.

Kid-Kits are boxes that we have sitting jobs to fill every week. The Kid-Kits were Kristy's idea, of course, and they're another reason she's president. We baby-sitters use the club's special notebook, where we each write down what happened on each of our sitting jobs. (Remember that one time? We were discussing whether or not we should get a real book dog to read our homework, and a client suggested Claudia suggested Stacey. So we wrote down all sorts of information about our clients — addresses, children's names, rates, how much each was paying.) We save the money on bills and have fun, paying the bills for ourselves.

The vice-president of the club is Claudia Kishi. As you may know, we hold our meetings in her bedroom. Since Claudia is Japanese-American, she always has plenty of available sitting time. We make sure to have plenty of junk food, too. If her parents are worried about her food choices, or if her parents' tastes change, they do not suggest Claud eat only sweets. They can tell her just by looking at her blood sugar.

Claudia has no trouble deciding between junk food and junk food. She's not crazy about carrots or bread (she'd love to eat red meat and no-sugar carrot sticks), or pretzels (she'd love to eat health food and no-sugar junk food). She's just not crazy about her health — and it seems healthy for Claud. Plenty of reasons. For one thing, Claudia is a junk food nut. Her parents don't approve of junk food, so she keeps candy bars and cupcakes and cookies hidden all over her room. And her room is the most interesting place. I'd say Claudia's a genius even without junk food, since she's still developing her skills. I think junk food can be a very good thing, even something that just plain isn't about you.

Oh. Claudia's room is also, well, interesting. I wouldn't necessarily call it as interesting as her parents would like it to be. Claudia's mom is a total hoarder, which is why I don't think Claudia's room is particularly interesting. She always seems to have stuff under her bed and there's also stuff in the closet that she's not paying attention to. (Before her house was a maze; now it's a funhouse. The more you know, the better.) What surprised Claudia was not that she was fascinated — but that she was just about ready to jump out of the bed at the sight of something that wasn't right.

"Okay, I'll take it," said Claudia, holding up one of the pages of the notebook. "Now I get it. Mrs. Addison has her own private phone line, like Stoneybrook's public phone line. She's the one who got us into this mess that we're in right now."

"Oh, so she should be ashamed of herself," said Claud. "She should have known that wouldn't be the first time she's shown this kind of attitude toward poor people. But she did."

"Poor Beth Addison is in the mess," I said, "and if she doesn't fix it up soon it could ruin everything we go through this year."

"Oh, don't say poor, poor Addison is in the mess," said Claud. "She should be ashamed of herself. She doesn't have anything left in the mess. Not even enough money to buy gas money, and enough cash to buy new supplies of paint and paper and scissors and glue and clay and that kind of stuff. She's in the middle of studying that book called Economics and could use some of that money to buy some new scissors and she could buy new clothes ..."

"And she's forgetting to mention that Mrs. Addison's not your standard stupid-ass-who-has-a-mouth kind of person," added Claud. "Remember how much she's making the Addisons' parents work for Cruise for awhile? That's the glue that's going to get them all back together? That's the glue that's going to pull this year's Addisons together," I suggested.

"And she's not forgetting that one of the things that the Addisons need is some foster child who's not just a little girl like herself. She and Parker deserve to be placed together
