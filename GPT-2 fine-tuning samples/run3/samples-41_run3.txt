y, you're a wild animal.

"You don't look old, but that's my secret," Jessi said, standing with her back to him. She was holding a baby kitten to her waist, and she looked so young, that Jessi couldn't believe it.

"Well," she said, "I really can't wait."

Jessi was laughing and joking. "Uh, thanks, Mom," she cried as she held it tight to his waist. "You'll have to sit at the bar of a bar, don't you?"

"That would be okay," I replied.

Jessi couldn't help it. "I mean, look, the way I dress. I look like a man, but don't call me that. I'm all-American, after all. And to make people feel cool about dressing me like an American, I have to be really, really smart. But I'm kind of stupid, too. I hate the way I look."

Jessi grinned. "I like it!" she said, smiling. "Just ask me about fashion. I have the best clothes in my life, and I wear them to all my meetings." She added, in a high-pitched voice, "And the coolest clothes, too. I think that's what makes me the best dresser. I think I'm the best dancer. And I am one of the best friends."

I glanced at my watch.

"We're going to a gym tonight," my boss announced quickly. "A lot of the sports activities we're doing right now are going to the gym. The kids are coming."

Jessi nodded with delight, and I stepped out into the room. We were already the number two club (I was the secretary) in our club, and I was practically a junior member. (The only new members were my parents.)

"Oh, you mean the sports?" she asked. "Just like the gym."

She gave me some kind of look to help calm my nerves. I didn't like it. I don't like the way I look. The way I see is completely wrong. I have no idea about myself. I look like a teenager. I'm from the South Bronx, an incredibly black neighborhood. And yet, the way I look, I seem to be totally average (I'm not sure if that's a real handicap, but I was born and raised in a small, white town.) But that doesn't stop me from feeling nice about myself at least a little bit. And I think I do look better than I did when I was at my best.

Not to be outdone, a few other black boys were all smiles. And my grandmother. Mrs. Stoneybrook is the most brilliant thing I ever had. She always gives me great gifts, from being the only African-American to her love of kart racing and reading (I love African-American literature and poetry, too). She's an amazing artist, and I admire her for her ability to write in a way other African-American artist could not. She's also the only African-American to win a gold medal for gymnastics. Mrs. Stoneybrook is also a great author.

I reached for Mrs. Stoneybrook in my pocket-sized handwriting.

"Hello, Mr. President?" Jessi said. "What's up?"

I pulled my notebook from our bookshelf. Jessi had to leave her notebook with the other girls. "We're going to a meeting of our club," I explained to the other members.

"It's a business meeting, Mr. Schafer. We're going to try to make your clients feel like equals. You guys have to fill out a form, which has an important time limit, and we'll see if we can convince you guys to do it."

The meeting fell to a sitting. Everyone agreed to sit except Mrs. Stoneybrook and Mr. Schafer.

Then I opened my notebook and checked the boxes for stickers. All three of us looked confused. I read one and shook my head. "No, no, no, no. I have to do it. Mr. Schafer, did we get this right?"

"The meeting is over!" replied Mrs. Stoneybrook.

"Yes, I know," I replied.

We both walked through the door of Stoneybrook's bedroom. I checked around the room, checking up the ceiling for signboards in the floor. My notebook was on the desk, looking like something out of a movie, and I couldn't believe I opened it. It looked like something used in an A-ha moment.

"Where's Mr. Schafer?" asked Kia. My dad, who was sitting next to me, grinned. "Who said him down, Mr. Schafer? I thought he was a
