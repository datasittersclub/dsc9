======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 were in, was so busy, she didn’t even bother telling me about the job.

She’d told me all about it when she signed the two-year contract, and now I was pretty sure that’s what she was going to do. After all, she already had to be up to no good.

In fact, Jessi has a pretty average height. She’s white, about the same as Mal, with brown eyes and hair, and she has no sense of style whatsoever. (That’s partly because she’ll grow out her features, which Mal says she hates, since she has too much to do.)

Jessi’s family is the Ramseys’. She’s Japanese American, and she has wild, curly hair. She’d grown up in California, but her mom died when Mary Anne was a baby, and her dad always lived here. His kids are now seven and two, including a puppy named Charlie, who was adopted by Jessi’s grandmother.

Jessi’s great and outspoken, she’s as loud and outspoken (she has a boyfriend named Logan Bruno) as any of us. She loves sports, but she never stops learning new things, such as junk food. When she finally makes the right move (she did after her big day at school), she buys a Nancy Drew book filled with recipes and ingredients.

She’s a natural with a personality disorder, and she’s an extremely busy person. She spends her summer vacations out of the city (as she’ll be back at some point) and her time away from her family’s mansion in Paris. She runs a little kids-led softball team called Kristy’s Krushers.

Now, Jessi’s family used to live in the house at Claud’s until recently, but they only used to live there because her father’s company transferred them. That’s changed, too, and Jessi’s family’s become more comfortable living here. Now they live with their dad, who just happens (almost right now) to be divorced. I’m sure he’s a good guy, and the divorce will probably be hard on Jessi and her family.

So Jessi has to deal with a real problem. She hasn’t developed a healthy eating habit, and her diabetes is keeping her from eating the right amount of fruits and vegetables a day. Add to this the fact that she has to carry around a hidden container of water, which she’s allergic to, which can also hurt her breath, and the list goes on — and you get a very busy woman.

Jessi’s a real individual. She wants to be readjusted to the next level, and she even dresses in the most sophisticated clothes in her neighborhood (such as the most striking clothes she saw in years), including her long black hair, which she puts up proudly. Jessi has petite, thin black hair, and a complexion of permed blonde. She loves to read, especially horse stories, like Marnie, and she’s always getting her ears pierced.

Mal (yes, her boyfriend) is probably the most interesting person in our class. Before her family came to Stoneybrook, they were her parents’ pet. She has chocolate-brown eyes and long, curly hair. She has these long, pointed, black eyes (she’s Japanese-American) and wears glasses, braces, and nothing else.

Mal has chocolate-brown hair and perfect skin. She has a soft southern accent that comes right out of the way to her voice. The way she talks is terrific, even though sometimes she’s way off center stage.

Kristy and I didn’t say much at first, because Jessi, who is diabetic, doesn’t even come to meetings. Instead, we joked about her diabetes. I felt weird, and I wasn’t sure how I could help Kristy with any of the things she does well, like being an active girl at school. But I kept thinking and thinking and I said all the right things about her, and I felt really important to the BSC.

Then I got so nervous I started telling my best friend Stacey that I was going to be taking over her job in New York.

Stacey loves New York (she’s an associate member of the BSC), and she’s already booked her place in the club for a while. She’s really cute, with thick, red-and-white curly blonde hair and silky, creamy blue eyes. She wears a ton of her fashion out there, and she has a really good sense of style.

Not all of Stacey’
