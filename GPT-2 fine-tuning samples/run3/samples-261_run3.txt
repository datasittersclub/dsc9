 to sit on the bed while the doctor carefully checked the baby out and checked her blood sugar — that was all for one night. The doctor is the only one available to the Baby-sitters Club. Even if she takes over, the club could still turn into a disaster. There is one other thing you might notice about the club; they hardly have a secretary. The club meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty to six, from five-thirty to six. That's because Claudia Kishi never takes on a job, but she doesn't let that stop her from being president. For example, she has held several special sitting jobs for her and the club. Claudia is the vice-president of the BSC. We call that position secretary because she puts in extra hours just to fill in for the regular baby-sitters. During that time she also collects dues and supplies snacks and stuff for the kids who come to club meetings. (Oh, and she also buys the junk-food.) Claudia has the perfect complexion, and the style, but she also takes good care of herself. She always wears her black high-topped glasses, black flats, and her famous long sleeves, and keeps a steady supply of braces (which she always has loosened). The bracelets in Claudia's jewelry box are actually sort of cute — which is an obvious fact, since they look so different. Claudia wears the braces every day, she gets to spend some quality time with each one, and she also has a nice old-fashioned way of wearing her hair. Her eyebrows are big, she has really curly hair, her skin is really blonde, she wears glasses and braces (which she has her fingers dug out from under her glasses), and she's always wearing the big new look I mentioned before that is about the style.


The baby-sitter club might look more like a business than a business. Claudia's club is, naturally, a business. It has about an eighth of its members and has a steady supply of baby-sitters. The club's members are mostly Japanese-American and from across town — mainly because Claudia is Japanese-American and also because of her mother. The rest of us are not Japanese-American, either. We are all white. The only thing that is different about us is that we are different races. For one thing, we have African-American skin, and for another, we are very exotic. We are really good dressers, and a little crazy about our hair that way. We also like to dance (mostly for laughs) and we've been known to wear funky clothes, such as the BSC's old stuff called the Black Stace. But none of that really bothers Claudia. She goes to a private school, which she really wants to attend, where she could get a good-looking boyfriend. She's not shy about that. She wants to be an actual model, and she wants to be part of the BSC, not just some supermodel who can have her bigamous, but one of the best-looking outfits in the business. Claudia thinks she looks gorgeous like that. She dresses like one of those models who wears a big outfit for days at a time and wears her hair pulled back, like a long-sleeve T-shirt that says TOTW because she's never had contact with the world before, but instead wears it with super-cool outfits. Plus, since her parents have decided to let her have contact lenses and have her own personal phone line, there will be no problem with her having contact lenses. Which is weird. I guess you could say it's like seeing Krissy on the set of a movie that never comes to me. (Not a problem but one that Krissy is having trouble with, too.)

Claudia’s really cool. She looks like a dancer. She is about as cool as Claudia’s look, but Claudia is the personification of ballet. She comes from a pretty normal family, mainly my father’s and my mother’s and the way she looks. Her hair is long, and she wears black-and-white leotards and long (on one side, or at least, she wears them) leggings that aren’t tied tight right above her head. Claudia has the biggest personality, and she takes every hint or detail of a person well. For example, she is the one who thought of the BSC when she was an infant. I think now that I’m older than she is, Claudia must have thought of that idea. The club was the idea that got her to that part of the building, when her father left the farm and moved away to California and the family moved into Claudia’s big house. Claudia had been watching her father go through some sort of big struggle — he couldn’t get any kids. She had been trying hard to get her father to leave, but he didn’t let up
