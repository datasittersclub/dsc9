 has the feeling that Mary Anne doesn't want to move. (Which makes sense, because I think that her family is pretty conservative.) Mary Anne is an only child, and you never really see her until she's about six.

I love to talk to Mary Anne. It’s almost like, when I see her in a movie with Kristy Thomas, “Oh, Mary Anne was crying,” or “Oh, she was so happy,” or “Oh, she was so strong,” or “Oh, she was so sweet,” Mary Anne is telling us. If we ask her, we tell her. She may feel old and alone for a while, but she wants to be special and special.

I wonder if it’s because Mary Anne is quiet and shy and sensitive, and pretty short, that parents don’t like her. Maybe being asked for things just gives someone else her right to ask for the things she doesn’t have.

Have I mentioned how sensitive and sensitive Mary Anne is? I don’t know, Stacey. I think our families are even close.

After Mary Anne’s mom and Jeff left, Dawn got moved to Charlotte, but you know what? It’s a big, complicated family. First, Jeff had to move back to California. Then Mary Anne got moved. From there, the adjustment was much harder. Just as Jeff and Dawn began to live in the city, they needed to visit a lot. So the triplets moved in to help with the food. (Mary Anne, who had grown up in Stoneybrook, wasn’t available to live in the city, but she and her father would have been happy to.) Moving into a new house is no hardship for a family.

Here’s how the club works, as I’ve explained before:

We meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty to six in Claudia Kishi’s room. Claudia is the headmistress at the Kishi Apartments. During meeting hours, she collects appointment money and passes it around, making sure there’s always a good treat for the kids. If there is any leftover money (which it isn’t — it’s for my art club, which used to be Claudia’s favorite subject), she fixes it for us. Sometimes we get so used to paying dues that we forget to — as Claudia says, we forget to tip!

The club treasurer is me. I’ve done a little advertising (mostly to baby-sitters), but mostly to advertise Little League, so I’ll move on to Miss Chiappa’s Tiffany’s.

I’ve been in advertising for quite a while now, but lately I’ve been doing some publicity for the club. Part of the reason I became such a success is that I put together this little flier I’ve made. Yes, there are brochures, posters, and signs all over the place. But these things have turned into little posters, and I really am taking them down, if I ever need to. They’re not worth the trouble. And Mary Anne has become so used to them that lately she has taken special antibacterial creams to her teeth and is now having great skin and hair. Mary Anne is really cute, but she has more than her share of allergies and asthma.

Here’s how the club works, as I’ve explained before:

We meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty to six in Claudia’s room. Claudia is the vice-president. She has her own phone number, so clients can call whenever they like. So they can call almost anywhere in the city. When a call comes in, Claudia calls. She knows who’s available to take the job. (If someone is not available, they can call.)

Claudia has long, pale, beautiful hair, two sextillions of it, and gorgeous blue eyes. I like Claudia too much to the Art Club — because she’s so naturally beautiful. Like me, she’s a health-food nut. She loves junk food, particularly the stuff called corn dogs. Her parents think she should be eating regular food. Instead, they’ve hidden cookies and pretzels under her bed, have dangled popcorn, and sprayed fliers across her room.

Claudia is the club’s vice-president. Her main duty is filling in the blank. She is really great — an excellent English teacher, who loves to teach kids about science and technology.

We call this our Kid-Kits. They’re boxes filled with our old toys, games, and books, plus new clippings, art supplies,
