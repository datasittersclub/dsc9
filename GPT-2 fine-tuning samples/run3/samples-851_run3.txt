 time from Monday). Our Kid-Kits can cover practically anything — short skirts, baby-sitting boxes — so parents can usually be assured that sitters will be available for whatever job comes along.

Stacey has blonde, permed hair, amazing skin, and the absolute best skin — plus, she lives in Kristy's and Abby's basement. She has to deal with all that garbage. It’s disgusting. To say it’s disgusting would be an understatement. Her eyes are the happiest I’ve ever seen her. Even her clothes are fun and stylish. She doesn’t care what anyone thinks of her. It was fun to see her break in, but I have to admit that she stays in braces and glasses. For her part, Stacey can wear anything, even Nancy Drew mysteries. If a book turned out to be a mystery (e.g. A Wrinkle in Night), Stacey would have to be in the attic with a ghost on the inside of it. So you would be hard pressed a stranger wouldn’t be watching you.

Stacey may look like a star, but she has good taste. Stacey was one of my baby-sitting dreams from the beginning, and so too has her brilliant mind. She knows how to raise kids well and is unflappable. So I can’t understand why she doesn’t seem to have a soul. What’s the secret? Well, she has to be sensitive to her dark side. Recently she’s started to wear a shocking pair of overall shorts, both inside and out. That was gross — and disgusting — at first. Now Stacey is wearing a vest that looks like it was originally cut short. It’s disgusting, too. It barely matches her body, like someone getting pierced in a closet. Or if someone else was wearing it, Stacey would have gotten really wet. Don’t even try to read what happened to the gorgeous French student Kari! She just happens to have a real vest.

As far as fashion goes, Stacey is fashion chic — even if she wasn’t a super-fashionable person. Her clothes are incredibly thin and light. Her hair is short and permed only in an extremely cool, permed way. (I know, because I saw her hair do that show this really funky show in the back of the magazine two weeks ago.) I think she was trying to hide her blonde hair, which is pretty amazing considering that her parents say she’s too pretty. Maybe she just has it like a disease, though.

So maybe it’s not surprising that Stacey is tall, rich, and blonde. Big dreams come to those with big bodies. She has the perfect skin, right down to the color of chocolate. I could never say no to her.

Not long ago, the BSC was in California for the first time. We had an executive call and no one else was available to take over the duties. I think scheduling can be a pain, so I enlisted my good friend Stacey McGill, a health-food nut, to take the job. Naturally, the reactions were mixed. I was sort of disappointed, but I was sure I was in charge of being super-organized and being treated like a first-grader.

Well, this was how things seemed to me — fair or not. It was clear that Stacey had saved the best for last. And I knew she was feeling grateful. Our meetings usually start promptly and without fail. Stacey was on time, although not for long. It was early March, and I felt sort of out of my league. Luckily, I had the strength to scout the hills and snow-coastal mountain bike trip uprange.

What I didn’t have was camp. It was more a ritualistic rite for Dawn. She’d have to ride our twin cranks (Darnie and Charlie) every day for two weeks straight, then go back to working. (Dawn hates riding cranks. She feels as if she might break her ankle or something.) I was the first one of us to arrive at Dawn’s house around 5:25. Just then, Kristy walked into the kitchen and found the family busy thumping away pots and pans, dishes on the stove, and a plate of baked chicken (and rice) in the oven.

We decided to eat on the floor, by putting on sweats in the center and a visor on our head that looked as if it might protect us from the sun. Kristy said we should eat in the morning, but I said no. I think Dawn had a little too much to drink. (Her parents, naturally, wanted me to stop by to have a glass of milk and a half.) Anyway, someone just caught Kristy off guard. She was waving her hand around as she passed me
