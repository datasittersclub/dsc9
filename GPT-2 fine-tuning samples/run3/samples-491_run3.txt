 have a different way of thinking. She’s also a champion health-food shopper, and the mother of two adorable little little kids named Squirt (who’s seven) and Boo-Boo (who’s four). They can’t eat health food (or candy or chips), so she makes sure to stock all the stuff.

Claudia’s the best at math, although she does a good job at it. Claudia is a terrible student, mostly because of her blood sugar. But maybe that’s why she’s such a good speller, and why she was the BSC treasurer.

Claudia is Japanese-American, with beautiful long, straight black hair. She wears makeup and an oversize smile. Claud often looks older than the rest of the members, but there are only two people in the entire club who are as young as she is — me and my best friend, Dawn Schafer.

Dawn is shy, sensitive, and very sensitive. She likes books, is a ballet dancer, and recently even danced a lead role in a Broadway play.

Her mom died when my father was just a baby. (Her dad is a big dweeb.) That left Mrs. Schafer to take care of seven kids, which only grew worse when Dawn's younger brother, Jeff, moved back to California to be with his father.

Dawn used to be the only one of us with a steady boyfriend. His name is Richard, and he’s from Connecticut. He’s a sports fanatic, and even though Dawn is not allowed to take part in softball or soccer afternoons, she’s always full of energy. Her mom can’t help but watch her kids (who’re nicknamed Squirt and Boo-Boo) sometimes.

Our club’s founder, Stacey, just happened to be the perfect person for the job. She’s extremely sophisticated with blonde-curly hair and pale skin and gorgeous blue eyes. Stacey takes great care of her kids, and she makes sure her house is always sanitary and cleaned whenever she can.

As treasurer, Stacey collects dues every Monday, and she uses the money to pay for such things as Claudia’s phone bill, the club lunch (that’s what we do), and, of course, the club notebook. We use the money to keep track of how much money we earn (we write up every week about how we spend some of our treasury money), and to pay for things like my phone bill.

The dues keep Claudia’s stepfather busy, since he’s usually busy during my sleep (or, if I’m hungry, I’m hungry). But Stacey doesn’t seem to mind much about my sitting habits.

Fortunately, Stacey is the same age as mine, and she has the most striking figure of her kind: curvaceous. I admire her for the fact that she wears this big, huge smile on her face, like a dancer. The smile is a lot like mine.

Like me, Claudia is a very good student. The Astronomy Club is her schoolwork. She’s also a certified genius, and it’s a good thing that this is one of the schools most popular subjects.

That would make her the eighth-grade astronomy student in the world, and even that number is pretty high. But I’m not too sure about the math part. I do know that I could probably do well in a number as simple as an algebra problem. That’s why I like math so much.

At this moment, a group of nine boys and a couple of girls sat in Claudia’s room, discussing the latest subject in algebra. As they walked by, someone switched the subject — and everyone began squirreling away, laughing and running out the door.

At that point all around us, everyone seemed extremely excited. We exchanged quick, proud looks. Kristy said that we just wanted to be alone while everybody else giggled.

Of course, this meeting wasn’t really about the problems at hand. Kristy was talking about what was going on in the school cafeteria. We tried to think about the next thing that would happen. Who’d be free to take the Baby-sitters Club lessons that afternoon? Who might be free to take a private phone line? We asked everyone about each issue, and we made some tough decisions.

The conversation turned to the Baby-sitters Club. How would we handle the appointment of a president and a vice-president? How would we decide who should take the job?

We answered all our questions right away, and everyone let out a big sigh of relief. Then we began to think about what might happen if a baby-s
