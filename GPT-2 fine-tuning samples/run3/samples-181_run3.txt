 Andrew and Cam. I had to sit in the officer's chair, though, since my brother doesn't come to this meeting. They're the oldest, the only children of eight, and they're both incredibly cool and cute. The other members of “the BSC” don’t come to meetings. They’re my friends.” Which is the great thing about my club. “No one is looking to come to a meeting to watch their favorite children.”

I don’t care how many jobs I can take, I have three kids. One of them is seven and two-and-a-half. The other four are seven and two; one is three and three-and-a-half; one is two and nine; and one is triple triple.

The triple triple. And yes, they are my kids.

“Let’s see,” said Stacey.

A moment later, I felt my breath catch on my shirt. “I’m not going to be the only one having a bad day.<|endoftext|>
Kristy Thomas is the president of the BSC, and the one who was the driving force behind the passage of the Parental Controls Bill in the (now-banned) sixth reading of the Florida General Assembly, which included new language meant to combat bad parenting and regulate what children do with their toys (except mine, which is pretty gross). (Mal had suggested this because she thought some new, smaller size would be nice.) In the passage that follows, the President has to explain to the parents and the members of the BSC how their kids are supposed to behave in ways that, as soon as the passage was signed, we all agreed would be rude. Then, Kristy’s voice cracks, and we all take a moment to picture how this little girl should dress, what her name should appear on her clothes, and how she would tie that scarf together. We all know this stuff is bad for us.

At the very beginning of the conversation between Mary Anne and Stacey, Stacey says, “Good day.” As we were laughing, I saw Kristy with a big smile on her face and my heart pounding. “What’s new in your book?”

“That’s what’s so hilarious.” Kristy smiled and gave Stacey and I a smile as she read the book.

“It’s called Young Adult’s Guide to BSC Kids,” said Stacey. She looked at our two kids (seven and four) with wide, dark eyes and then said, “Well, I guess it’s just a little thing that happened to me last winter when my grandmother brought the BSC to her house. That’s Kristy.”

I shrugged, knowing Kristy’s as good as mine.

Then Kristy’s smile faded. “Okay, fine,” she said, “I guess everyone is. I guess it was a nice thing. But then I’m sitting here in the seventh grade, and a ballerina is coming in to buy flowers. Well, I know that’s enough for one afternoon all over,” Kristy replied, pulling her hair together again. “Can’t wait, then.”

Stacey leaned forward in her chair. “Kristy, have you ever seen a ballerina before?”

Kristy smiled. “We see what I’ve seen.” She turned to Stacey. “That’s an incredible thing.”

Stacey is a regular ballerina in Stoneybrook. Her friends know she likes the game. We thought so too. One of her favorites are the French club parlors. Stacey and I are regulars, and she’s very good at the game. (She’s not in ballet. Not even Mary Anne, the ballet coach, takes lessons.)

Stacey has long, long curly, black hair and wears very casual clothes. That’s exactly the sort of clothes she likes. She used to have a big, fancy wardrobe, but now she’s more sophisticated. When we were living in Stoneybrook, for example, most of the time Stacey was sitting at Kristy’s bed. She has blue eyes and beautiful, jet-black skin. But when I went to junior high in high school, Stacey started dressing like an American star. She was wearing all these clothes that matched the clothes she wore at the ball that night. (The ball was, as I explained, a big company football game.)

“This ballerina is in Stoneybrook,”
