And it’s true, I think Jessi thinks Jessi is hot. But that’s just because Jessi has a beautiful face and beautiful hair. She’s got two older sisters, one of whom is a genius, and one younger brother named Squirt. (He’s named Jaylen because the name means "'Tubby," but you know what? School is funny.) I think Jessi’s funny. She’s like a big sissy! Maybe she is, but she doesn’t care one bit. She just wants to be somewhere else.

Like I said before, Jessi has no brothers or sisters. She has only her father and mother, who is a real jerk. But then, her mom died when Jessi was really young. She got really old so she grew up first. Then her mother raised Jessi by herself.

Then her father just walked out on the family, leaving Mrs. Schafer to raise Jessi by herself. Well, that’s what happened. Then all of her wild dreams came true. Jessi’s mom met Watson Brewer and became their new best friend. They fell madly in love, too! They got married, got a daughter, and all of a sudden, Jessi’s family is very special.

Okay, back to the phone. Watson is President of the BSC, and he used to live in Louisville, Kentucky. Now he’s gone. It’s hard to believe, but Mary Anne and I are so grateful that he’s gone.

It couldn’t have been easy for Mary Anne when her dad walked out on the family long ago. But, just as he had on the day after Kristy was born, things got off to a rough start. For one thing, Mary Anne’s mom just walked out on the family not long after David Michael got married. And then, when David Michael got married, Mary Anne’s mom went back to her old job as Mary Anne’s place mover.

Then Mrs. Thomas got married again — this time, this jerk, old white guy named Watson Brewer. Why? Because he fell in love all over again, he divorced his wife, he got remarried, went back to his old life in Louisville, and got remarried.

Oh, good, he brought his soul back. And he did it right away. But then, Watson Brewer went off to Vietnam, and Mary Anne became single and lonely. Now she has a stepmom, a stepsister (and other valuable members of the BSC), and a stepsister and a stepbrother. (I’m sorry — my family has been stepsisterless for the past year and a half.) And, not long ago, just as she and her family were moving across country as separate acts, Mrs. Thomas decided to try to get a divorce.

I don’t know how much longer Mary Anne would live on alone with her father, her mother, and her stepsister. And I don’t know if she wanted to be at home with her father or with her mother, with her stepmother, or with her stepsister.

What would it be like to be part of an independent family?

I’d love to. But I would also love to be part of a major American baby-sitting business.

Mallory and Vanessa just about stood up to me on their own. (Just like I did.)

Let me just say right now that I do not think they’d be happy about a divorced Mrs. Thomas or the fact that her stepfather moved back to his old job as a lawyer.

So I said maybe they’d think about the BSC, and then I just told them about the club.

Here’s what I said:

The club was one of Kristy’s ideas. And it was really interesting to see how it became business after business, starting with Claudia’s dad. When he got married again, he really moved his old house into his neighborhood, and he bought it for a living fee. What do you make of that? Extreme? I think it’s pretty awful.

I’d probably get mad if I said I didn’t like the way Kristy handled the breakup.

I guess I did.

But let me back up. I’m not surprised that the breakup affected me in some unexpected way. It affected Kristy.<|endoftext|>
“So what if?” asked Claudia, sniffling just as loudly as I sniffled.

“I’m not sure,” I said, looking around. “How would you handle this?”

“Debate,
