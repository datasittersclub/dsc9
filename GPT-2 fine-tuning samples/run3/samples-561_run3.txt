Stacey began to think again about her allergies. They were in her bloodstream. If you think for a second about the blood, you’re probably wondering why it’s not passing in the same place twice. It’s because Stacey has a disease called asthma that keeps her breathing so out of control.

There’s another reason Stacey’s allergies aren’t a big deal. She also makes sure chocolate always tastes good, and she’s great with kids.

Stacey may have some snobbery-mindedness, but you’d never know it from her brown eyes. (Her hair is, for example, pale, unblended, and she has the longest brown hair in school.)

Mary Anne and I are almost as guilty as Stacey of being mean, though. There are plenty of other things we worry about and laugh at.

There’s Emily Michelle, another junior in the class. Her name’s Kristy. She’s the only member of the BSC who doesn’t eat meat and doesn’t have diabetes. She’s very stylish, and she’s an amazing color.

I wonder who the girls in our club are? Let me guess.<|endoftext|>
Before I begin, I should say I can tell you a little about myself and my family. I’m Mary Anne Spier. Now that I’m thirty-seven, I’m a widower to my mother and father. At eighty-five, the only children I have are Stace, Charlie, and Adam, from whom I’ve got a younger sister named Emily Michelle.

I’m the last member of the BSC, because I haven’t been sitting job after job since the day I was adopted by my dad. We held our meetings at his house on Monday after Wednesday since we used to be in school. I’m very devoted to my father and the BSC. My mother tries to give him all the things she has (boy, do I want to spoil this for you). But that doesn’t prevent her from getting to know me, so I’m glad this hasn’t happened to me since I was a baby.

First of all, my mom died not long ago. It was pretty bad but she recovered. Then, after I was in a foster home, I was brought into his house. He had been in there for several weeks, I can tell, and all my friends were there (except for Claudia). I guess my mom missed him in high school and college, when she was a toddler, but not anymore.

So my dad was the first one to come to my mother’s house and help out, and she helped bring me into it and take me with her.

So, there we were, seven kids, all dressed in baby clothes, and all laughing and joking and trying to make life comfortable. I guess I just felt sad and lonely.

I sighed.

“Sorry,” I said. “You and I didn’t get along pretty well.”

I glanced down at my watch. “Five minutes until meeting time. It looks like I better get out of here.”

“I’m not in trouble,” my mother said. “Are you sure? I could use some of my time with your study group. But you're going to have to come in very early. Is my dad really late for this? And why did he come to your house so early this morning?”

I shook my head. “Well, if you want it early, here it is.”

“But —” my mother began, “you’re not allowed to bring a snack along. Why would he bring a snack along? His room is quiet, you know.”

But I couldn’t help it. My mind seemed calm and clear again. My room isn’t a dull dull dull place, and my room’s a pretty quiet one. If I’d brought a snack and hadn’t sat there all day, nothing would have changed.

“This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club will come to order.”

After that, everyone had finished talking.

“Good afternoon,” my mother said. “And good night,” she went on to tell us about my room.

Claudia Kishi arrived early as usual and came across our table as usual. She was wearing her long blonde hair lifted up, as usual. (Her hair is one of the best she gets, by the way. It cascades in ring
