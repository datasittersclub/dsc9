y, but my dad would go overboard on that.

Jessi is our treasurer because Kristy's mom does an amazing job organizing the money we have in the treasury. So she collects the dues for us and then distributes the funds evenly among us. We use the treasury funds to buy supplies for Kid-Kits, and other fun stuff for Kid-Kits.

"Huzza!" I said.

"Huzza!" I could only give Jamie the rueful expression he often puts on his house.

We cracked up. I knew he was so busy, so busy, but it was the right thing to do. There are still plenty of kids left over in the club, but not as many as in the club days.

"See you Tuesday," Kristy said with a yawn.

"See you Tuesday!" Mary Anne cried again.

"See you Tuesday, too, Stace," said Kristy thoughtfully. We were sitting there in our usual spots. It was a Friday meeting and I wasn't even able to sit. "It's a busy Tuesday, isn't it?"

"Yup — but not as much as my dad would be telling me, of course!" I blurted out. "I'd like to pay your mom back tomorrow afternoon. And you better go home and rest for four."

I know Kristy hated us on Friday nights because that's how she always feels. "You may have to," Kristy said.

"I could do it tomorrow, anyway," I told her. "My dad is telling me so."

Kristy frowned. "You mean exactly as you say?" she asked.

"Not exactly," I said quickly, trying hard to keep my eyes open.

"It’s five the next day. We talk about it on the next day�s program."

The BSC started. Kristy, Mary Anne, and Stacey were my best friends. My favorite memory of the day, however, was before any of the other members of the club arrived at that Wednesday meeting. We were sitting in the same place we always do: Claudia's closet, her phone in the lock, Jessi and Stacey in the director's chair, and a pile of paperbag paperbacks behind her. I was still in one of the piles. "It’s kind of a crowded place," I said to Kristy.

"It is in there," said Claudia quickly. "A little closet. Let us all get started. I will call you right back."

Kristy dashed out the door, glancing at Mary Anne, who was sitting on the bed next to her. "Where did that come from?" she asked.

"From Mrs. Johanssen," she said quickly, taking a small bag out from underneath it. "She didn’t need it."

"Oh, good, I’m sorry," I said. I picked up the bag again, but Claudia still needed it.

Mary Anne looked confused. "Why not?" she asked.

"For what purpose," said Claudia. "I don’t know. Maybe tomorrow afternoon."

I shrugged. "This could be a lot to handle. We could take care of ourselves on Wednesday night then."

Claudia looked disappointed in herself. "I don’t think it will work," she said. "I think we’re too busy."

I’d been considering that too. What with Jessi missing the Wednesday meeting and her brother Charlie missing the whole week (no kids involved), it seemed like the only sensible thing for the baby-sitting club to do.

But I wasn’t going to let the despair overtake me. I was going to do it and do it in a way that felt good. And, to keep things on track, I’d decided I’d try to be a good baby-sitter.

So that’s what we have today. Five BSC members, three regular members, two honorary members, and two associate members, all well-meaning and very nice (one of us called her a "special snowflake").

Claudia has always been on the short side. She’s an associate member and her love for children is practically a forbidden fruit. What she likes is just as much a snack as her passion for ballet, and is ready to take ballet lessons after school. But I’d like to have her back.

Our current BSC president, Mary Anne Spier, will soon be eighty-five, but she’s still coming to meetings. She’s already arrived on our rainy-day job, which basically means she rides the bus to meetings. That way we have time for our baby-sitting clients, who have their
