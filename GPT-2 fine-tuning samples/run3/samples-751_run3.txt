eway and the rest of us are BSC members, and part of the BSC. We are thrilled to be a regular part of the BSC, I think, since I have to be pretty active but not overly so. At times the BSC can be a little overwhelming. We aren't the quickest or most organized, but once we get into the flow we become good friends. And there are times when we get along really well. In addition to being Kristy's best friend, she's also the treasurer of the club, which is like playing the violin for the first time. It was Dawn who suggested I join the club. I couldn't wait until I'd seen the record book for the first time and had a handle on every member. I began working backwards, looking at Claudia's clock. It must have been nine after school, so I could have finished some pieces about my violin practice. But I had stopped at the phone. I was waiting.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club,” Kristy said. She held up one final piece of paper. When I’d opened it, I’d marked down some basic information. The record book kept track of all the clients, their ages, and their likes and dislikes. This was one big, long list. I’d written down how I planned to spend the money, how much information I wanted to include, and how long it would take me to get started. As secretary, I’m in charge of keeping the record book up-to-date, and I never, ever try to juggle so many jobs.

“Kristy, this meeting of the BSC will now come to order …” (Kristy cleared her throat.) “This meeting of the BSC will now come to order.”

It was that time last week, when Mom announced that Stacey would be taking on her old klutz job of VP, and suddenly I couldn’t believe my luck. My room had exploded. The room began to laugh. I’d pretended to jump in but the laugh was short lived. The room was filled with shrieking and cheering, as Mom announced the meeting was now in such disarray that I had to be driven out of the room.

“Any new business or business to discuss?” Claudia asked as she entered. “My room hasn’t been quieted this afternoon.”

“Well, this is sort of a surprise,” Kristy said, looking pleased. “I got a call from Robert. He’s getting awfully busy.”

“Shopping for a new car?” Mary Anne began, taking the manila envelope home from Claudia’s room.

Kristy Thomas is the most important person in the world. She goes to Stoneybrook High School (where she’s a true love) and is the treasurer. She’s the reason we hold the meetings here in my bedroom and stays responsible while I’m at work. We used to joke that Kristy used to dress exactly like a seventh-grader there (she’s still learning), since she grew up in Stoneybrook. But guess who joined the BSC? Yup, the founding members of the Baby-sitters Club. They were, well, the BSC.

So there’s you, I guess you’ll start out. First off, Kristy is very down-to-earth. She’s the reason I like her so much. She’s a ten-year-old kid who was sent on a date with this nice guy, Dawn Schafer. After the date she and Dawn’s mom got married and Kristy moved into the Schafers’ old farmhouse around town.

And Dawn’s grandmother moved in after the house was razed to make way for it. It’s a very neat little house (with a secret passage, where the family members could meet, talk, and celebrate together) with plenty of room for everyone. It was also a long time ago, but it had once been a pretty busy house. When Kristy and her siblings came along, the house wasn’t exactly quiet. All that time she spent listening to her mother make call after call to find a sitter. Kristy’s mom died when Kristy’s younger brother, David Michael, was a baby. She came back to the Ramsey household when her dad was transferred back to New York City, and the Spiers and I were only baby-sitting for a couple of months.

As I mentioned above, Dawn is a member of the BSC not only because she’s the most complete person in the world, but because she’s also the only member with the deepest, darkest
