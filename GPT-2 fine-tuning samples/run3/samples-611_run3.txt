Kristy likes sports (she coaches a kid's softball team — Kristy coaches a softball team, too. We play against the best students in our class, and vice versa). She's the one who figured out a way to make sure everyone could count on her being cool and understanding, and that she always had the guts to do things the old-fashioned way, always coming up with cool ideas for making the kids happier and more responsible. “You’re not helping,” I'd have said to her. “Well, maybe you’re,” Claudia would have said, twisting to speak without repeating a single word, “just doing it.”

“I know,” Kristy corrected her.

“I just had a brainstorm. Something about a bike track,” said Claudia, smoothing the back of her robe with a tip of her pencil. “Great!”

Kristy grinned at me. “Guess what? I’m dreaming up some new idea. Or at least thinking through a problem-solving plan.”

“What?” asked Kristy.

“What if all of our best friends could solve a problem-solving problem-thereby solving it themselves?” Mary Anne asked.

“Great!” said Kristy, waving her pencil gracefully. “Imagine. And you’d love it. And you wouldn’t want to be responsible and push yourself,” she added, “if that whole world depended on you.”

“What?” my friends called back.

“Imagine.” said Kristy.

“It’s going to take a genius,” Mallory informed us. “To figure it out.”

“What?” said Mary Anne suddenly.

“Tell me,” Mary Anne said to Kristy. “What would it take?”

“The whole world would,” Claudia volunteered.

“What?”

“Imagine,” Mallory said suddenly. “If all of us could solve a problem-solving problem-thereby solving it.”

“What?” I said.

“Who is it that’s going to solve that problem-solving problem-here’t-it?” Mallory asked.

Kristy nodded.

“How about a sports team?” Mary Anne asked. “An organization. And all athletes would be responsible — just like kids.”

“How about a group called the BSC?” Kristy asked. “We’re having a group called kids.”<|endoftext|>
When I walked into Claudia Kishi's room that day, I couldn’t help laughing. I felt incredibly lucky. I could have a real-life baby-sitting job. Sure, I’d worked with so many nice baby-sitters, but what would my life be without the steady help of so many great people?

Not exactly.

I was feeling really, really lucky. There were so many great people who would be able to help me. Maybe the best thing about that day was the fact that on that day — that day after I’d been on my bike, that was — I still am. I’m the first one to arrive. And I still am the day after my friend Kristy Thomas had driven her car up the Kishis’ lawn and stopped them at their front door.

“Hi, everyone,” I said. “This is Abby.

“You can call her anytime.”

I knew right away that I was swooning. Why did everyone swoon so much? Well, it wasn’t just the kids, either. It was me. It was the world. And you know what? Parents said we had to make a big push. That was one way to earn our continued attention. I don’t know how I could be at ease without it.

Or without Mom. Still, even though the day had come and gone by, I still felt like a teenager. I could feel the excitement. There was only one thing left to do — and Mom needed me. Not just any youngager (she’d driven me wild), but one devoted to my every project.

It wasn’t easy, though, especially when all my friends used to chant, 'Take your pick!' (Oh, Mary Anne, we’ll pick!)

It was also mostly mental
