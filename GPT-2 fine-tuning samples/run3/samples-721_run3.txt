 look and act a little cooler and have less of a strict image.

Our first BSC member is Mary Anne Spier. Mary Anne is short, as you can see, like me. But, unlike Ethan, she’s not the shape-shifting, loudmouth sort. She doesn’t need to be. She’s a pretty good person and has a nice sense of humor. She’s also a good listener and always coming into our meetings to tell the truth.

I love Mary Anne, even though my memory of the two of us is very limited. I still remember her leaving that afternoon and leaving feeling totally lost in thought. (She was packing.) I mean, Mary Anne was wearing the same outfits twice. And, she was in the same baby-sitting outfits, of course.

But don’t get the wrong idea. Let me back up and tell you something. Mary Anne’s mom married this sunny guy named Watson Brewer not long ago. He grew up in this nice, quiet neighborhood, so he lived in a nice, new house (that of course, didn’t have a lot of residents.) His wife, Sharon, had gotten divorced when he was in high school. He brought her back to Stoneybrook, which just so happens to be what brought him together with her mom and younger brother, Jeff. Then, just before they were married, Mary Anne and her father decided to Stevenson. They remarried. Sharon and her younger brother, Richard, went to Stoneybrook to study at a local college. They made good friends, and then Jeff and Mary Anne became friends. Soon they fell in love, and Sharon and Mary Anne and Richard and Claud became best friends. Not long ago, Sharon and Mary Anne discovered that their parents had dated since they were in high school. So they rekindled their romance, and when they married — right after they’d been through their wedding — things were exactly as they were.

But, I should tell you that my memory of Mary Anne in that baby-sitting outfit may be limited but — that’s what happens when you acquire a new memory. You get used to it. And that new memory can be very useful to you, too. So, don’t be surprised if I get really sentimental about a memory if it’s something I can relate to.

Let me tell you some things about Mary Anne. For instance, the way she’s dressed has been a mystery to her family. There are only seven of them on earth. Why? Because the Breweres moved here on this farm. Now they’re part of the Thomas family.

That’s easy enough for Mary Anne. Her father and mother are originally from Long Island. They’re so used to their new home that they hardly ever visit. That was around the time Watson Brewer married Dawn’s mom, who moved to Stoneybrook from California. Dawn and Mary Anne quickly became friends, and decided to get married. Mary Anne and her father moved into the old farmhouse on Long Island, so Dawn and her mother became local residents. (They are now also neighbors too; the old farmhouse used to be the only resident's residence.) So there’s plenty of room for the family.

One big change for Mary Anne and the Thomas/Brewer household was Watson’s passing. He just happens to have a new (sort of) family, and not long ago he gained custody of Dawn and her mother. It was difficult for Dawn to accept that she was Mary Anne’s only child. It was very hard for Mary Anne, too, for awhile. Now, though, she’s happy with her father. She’s a member of the BSC, and she and her mother are both great friends. Besides, Dawn and Mary Anne are pretty much the same age! So they hardly ever talk about their parents. Watson is the same guy as in the old days, and Mary Anne has to pretend he’s a nice, grown-up person.

That doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it’s amazing how different Mary Anne and Watson are. Remember I told you I’d brought up this family? Well, they look a little bit alike. Mary Anne is of European descent, while Watson is a white guy. There’s also that weird, uptight quality that comes with being the first black person in a group. I mean, there’s not quite that — they’re pretty average. But even on this one family, they have interesting differences. For instance, Dawn’s African-American and Mary Anne’s white.

And that’s about it. Plenty of similarities between them, just a few that don’t make up for their differences. Besides race
