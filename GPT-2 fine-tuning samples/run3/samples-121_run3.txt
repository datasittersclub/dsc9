 covers and around us," she added.

"Well I think there won't be much of a club for her," Kristy pointed out, looking embarrassed as I stepped into the room. "I guess the last time Jessica and Jessa had a baby is a good one, too."

Jessa, a New Yorker who lives in Paris, said she's a big fan of BSC drama, while Jessica grew up watching Spier from the TV that she and Jessi used to watch together.

The two kids are now two and a half. Jessi is eleven and Jessi is thirteen. But it would be an act of sadign if they weren't the oldest children in the house. Jessi lives with her father and stepsister, Emily Michelle, who has diabetes and braces for the most serious form of stroke.

Jessi's parents got an unexpected help: Kristy had been dating Emily Michelle. Kristy has a lot of friends in the BSC: Jessi, Dawn, Jordan, and Stacey, who are all thirteen. They're both terrific at reading and writing. When Dawn finally started reading and writing, Kristy was shocked at how many of her older friends were interested in reading. She wanted to study art, but she couldn't make it to a class when school was practically all at her desk.

Kristy and Emily Michelle have grown up together. They both have long, silky-black hair and big glasses, as evidenced by their outfits. They look more like baby-sitters than adults. They're both full-time parents with a certain amount of artistic energy.

"You guys are our only friends when the day's finally done, Claudia!" Jessi announced as she reached behind Claudia's seatrest and pulled a pencil up close to Claudia's mouth. "I can't think of a reason I can't do a little things, but I should ask you about your allergies, especially when it comes to sweets."

As soon as I put my hand over Claudia's mouth, I couldn't help wondering what my baby-sitter had said, and why Claudia's parents thought she should be quiet about her allergies. I was glad to take it as someone had suggested I think she should be more sensitive about her own asthma, or if there was a reason for her mom to feel less worried about her and me.

Claudia took Stacey by an eyebrow. She has asthma, a kind of skin infection that can kill if you take too much of your inhaler.

Jessi's father hates sweets, even though she's allergic to it. I think she's a little sensitive, but I think parents don't like to give up on their sweet dreams.

"Can I get my junk food back?" Mallory Pike asked as she stepped aside into the hallway. "I have it. I'm glad it's food. But you know, it could hurt."

"I'm not allergic," Claudia admitted.

"Or what. How would you know?"

"We think maybe."

"We'll take it back," I said. I tossed Stacey's junk food overboard into the trash bag and put Jessi back in my seat. "You wouldn't know, would you?"

"Don't give me advice about eating it," Claudia agreed. "I'd be right back in a hurry. That junk food is just too much for me to handle. I'd just as soon throw it away and throw more stuff at the wall."

"Thanks, Mallory," I said. "Sorry I came in so late. I just want you to know about allergies."

Claudia smiled. "You'd better try. I just have to have it out. I mean, the sweets. They're all fine. I mean the fact they taste good. But they don't. And I have to tell everyone. I'm allergic to sweets."

"You're allergic to sweets?" Mallory asked.

Mal was sitting on her bed, holding a plate of Doritos on the table. "Well, I haven't had them since I fell in love. I think the kids hate me. I think I just look too much like a baby with almond-shaped ears. I just look great in them." She grinned at me.

"Okay," I commented. I turned my head at the monitor with a little grin. "I think you and Stacey will have it easier. And then we'll have to put everything together."

"You'd be hard pressed to find a baby-sitter better than Claudia."

"Yes, right," Mal said. "She's the only one of us in the entire country. And I wouldn't have the room. I'd have to be in the club room. And then I'd have to leave my seat on Claudia like a hawk on a tiller. She'd be the perfect baby.
