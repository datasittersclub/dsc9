 began the meeting. That was because Claudia had just met Mr. DeWitt. He's a nice guy with long, shiny blonde hair, and beautiful blue eyes. He seemed like one of those guys who wants to be a pro very soon as possible.

Maybe it's no accident that we meet there. I'm the honorary member, and you guys are already a member. If anyone would want to know more about the club, here goes. We meet three times a week, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, from five-thirty to six. And we always have pizza and snacks. Everyone likes to have a place to hang out.

There's one more thing I don't know. The club notebook. The club notebook is a notebook where we each write up what happens on our jobs. Every time Stacey makes a mistake, we're supposed to correct it. But since everybody's life is that of a professional basketball coach (aside from Kristy and me), the handwriting is kind of hard to crack.

Stacey comes from a huge family. She has seven kids! (Two of them are triplets, one is a ten-year-old) And she's used to raising them all by herself. She has two older brothers (David Michael and Andrew, who are eleven) and one younger brother with a learning family.

"What about you, Mal?" Kristy asked, holding out the club notebook. "Any projects you'd like to work on, particularly new designs?"

Mallory grinned. "I just finished the Kid-Kits, by the way. I'm the creative director. I'm always coming up with some great ideas. This week I'll be taking some of my own ideas. It's easier said than done. The Kid-Kits are coming, thanks to Watson, and it's so great."

"Cool?" Mary Anne spoke up. "They're coming soon."

"Cool. Okay. Thanks, Mal." I handed Jessi some of my art supplies, and Shannon checked the schedule. "I've already taken an art class with Dr. Johanssen. The schedule will be new experiences, like drawings of your own children. Remember that the children aren't reading anymore. They're doing whatever's going on with your house. And what do you think, next Thursday, at school?"

"I'll give you some new tips," I said, and Mal's smile widened. "I've been thinking that school is about your relationship with the children you care for. You never know when an older kid is going to want to visit. You never know what's going to happen when they get older."

"Oh, yeah," Jessi replied. "My own mother used to ask me for art lessons. All I got was, 'Will you be a child?' "

"I'm not exactly child-s-free," Claudia reminded me, "but I think it's more exciting than the idea of having art lessons, anyway."

"So?" I asked. I felt weird.

"Well," Mary Anne said, "how do you plan to get involved with your charges? It's important."

"Really, it's important!" Claudia jumped up. "My brother's going to be here Thursday night. The only people who can afford to miss the meeting are the parents. Why don't you let the four of us go straight home? We could take the shuttle, since we're a long way from Stamford, to Stamford and back."

Now Shannon was working on her computer. "Is that all right," she said, "or is it â€”"

"That's a great question!" cried Claudia! "Give me the answers. The answers for that Wednesday's question will appear tomorrow in the notebook, at the bottom of the notebook."

"Okay," I said. "Write the notebook. It'll be perfect." I took a pad and paper bag out of Claudia's desk and printed it. "Next Thursday at five-thirty," I said. "This Thursday!" I put the notebook in my pocket, closed my door, and started my work. That morning we became the youngest BSC members.

It's not always easy being a member. It was crazy being in the club. And it's not always easy being the new sister (or brother) of a regular girl. It's much more fun being the alternate officer.

But then it was a good thing we were the first to become a super-organized group because we've grown and changed so much.

Let me tell you about my friends in the BSC. Here are the seven main members:

I am vice-president. I serve as the club's secretary, Kristy's neighbor and another BSC member. She's good at languages, especially African-American, and she's the only BSC member with as much organization
