oring people from outside the company. We have counselors available for each job. Mary Anne can call us at her apartment because she’s always busy with Claudia’s big journal.

There’s one more difference between Claudia and Mary Anne, and that’s that in Jessi’s case, she has a mental breakdown. At some point, Mary Anne’s not around, she’s out of the picture, and Jessi’s mind gets really, really overloaded with activities. Jessi has had that kind of a fall in the last year or so. She talks by reading books like Candy and Dokki Donuts, but she doesn’t know everybody’s best friend yet. Mary Anne’s boyfriend (and stepsister) is off to a good start. Mr. and Mrs. Schafer have been great parents to Jessi’s and her younger brother, John Philip, Jr., so far. They’re also extremely sensitive and loving, too. I love the contrast, really.

Mary Anne is our secretary, our standby number one. She keeps all the important schedules straight and accurate. She knows what’s expected of us and adjusts to it with lots of new clients. She’s the one who signs up the baby-sitting sitters. She also knows her baby-sitting habits and makes sure she’s on time for important baby-sitting jobs.

She’s got zero clue as to what she wants or needs. Her idea of a chore is the art of scheduling things.

Claudia’s an artist. A genius. Why does she have to go through all this work? Part of the art goes with the mystery, in that she’s creatively twisting her own artistic ideas to fit her own personal style. For example, the book Claud writes and draws is really her idea. It’s constantly changing, and she does what she thinks is the right thing at the wrong time. For example, she could be working on an eighth-grade art project. The project is a children’s book called The Art of Crowds in the Crowd. Some of her ideas sound dumb and call for dumb money, but it turns out she’d like to be a professional ballerina.

Maybe the biggest mystery about her is her wardrobe. Claud wears casual clothes and these comfortable suede shoes, which her feet have developed over time, from years of use. She sometimes wears old, under-the-shoulder socks and carries her hair in a ponytail. I think she’d do a great impression of Mimi by pulling off that great imitation of Mimi with a capital O when she says, "Oh, you look great wearing these tight pants."

It is impossible to tell you about Claud’s skin, her hair, or her family history, since her hair is the easiest thing about covering it up like crazy. She is Japanese-American and has this beautiful long, jet-black hair. Her mother died when she was a baby and Claud’s father was never really there for her. He used to be very sad about it, but somehow he seems okay to this Claud’s expression, which says, “I know my parents don’t like me wearing that tight-fitting thing, but ’Well, I guess I’ll have to get used to it. I mean, I don’t really need it.” He really doesn’t. I think Claud comes to her from a huge family: Her mother, a mom who raised her own family, where her dad left when he got married again and she raised and handled her own kids. At the same time, she was working with six kids at once, so she made definite efforts to get every single one of them dressed exactly the way she believes is most responsible. And then, right at the start of seventh grade, she had to leave the eighth-grade version of the eighth-gen. Billions-dollar-a-week school. Gone for good!

Oh. So there’s me. My dad, acting all loquacious, is now my real self. He is as much a Thomas family thingie as Claudia is, although he is, at least in the end, quite strict with Richard. He does loosen up quite a bit at night, and I think he misses Mary Anne so much that he tries to top up everything on her. (Even though, as Claudia says, all her rules are in effect at night.) Anyway, one thing Claud and Mary Anne do not share is eating junk food, which is what everyone else is eating, except for me. At times I like to have a vegetable nugget on my plate, or a smoothie on my desk, or something like that. (But, boy, am I impressed. I
