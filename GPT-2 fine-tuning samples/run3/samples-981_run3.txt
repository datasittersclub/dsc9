 on her bed. She didn't want the light to get in the way of what she was doing, but I was pretty sure that if she concentrated on something else, the light wouldn't interfere with her other work.

But that was it. I had no trouble concentrating on anything besides ballet.

Kristy biked into the room and disappeared into the closet. (The closet is where we hide our baby supplies, which we buy from stores.)

"Nice trying," I said as Kristy walked into the room. She closed the closet and she clambered into her doublet. "You know what bothers me?" she asked after a long time. I knew she wanted to leave the room, but she had a couple of other things to think about.

"What about a baby-sitting camp?" Kristy murmured. "I mean, I haven't set foot in one around here in a while. But if we go, what's the point?"

Mary Anne was staring at me, and I realized that I had to admire her for what she was — a friendly person who wouldn't hurt anyone else's feelings.

"Camp," I said, ignoring the question. I decided to try it. I'd better start with some ballets and dancing. That was my idea.

The idea — or maybe it was the reason Kristy was the one who thought of it first. I mean, maybe Kristy could be a ballet instructor, but she just doesn't care what she's thought of it. She just wants to be a famous dancer, like her older sister, Janine (who's an actual star). You'd never guess that Kristy has clay feet and that clay hats and the prettiest lace shoes. She has a true passion for fashion, but it wasn't until seventh grade that she discovered the power of mass photography. Using her personal phone, she was able to share her unique looks with the world. Kristy was the first one to realize that her artistic talent could be applied to practically anything and that all the above were very cool. She enlisted her best friend (and occasional boyfriend) to help her learn how to shoot. They found that exposure to the wild weather in New York City allowed them to shoot babyish ballets in pretty, dark rooms. Kristy, who has brown hair and eyes, was the first of the bunch to realize that exposure to the sun wouldn't be enough to make skin tan during the whole process. They pulled together a troupe of school girls who idolized their favorite author, Ralph Nader. When it clicked into place, the costumes, the instructions, and the music — Kristy would have melted into my heart before she even thought about dressing the way she liked onstage.

Kristy's story is a little funny. She befriended a girl named Melody who happens to be an executive at a publishing company in New York City. The girl at the club who Kristy comes to know just shares her love of ballet. She's a gifted ballerina who has already danced several ballets. But, at least for now, Kristy is an excellent dancer. She puts her foot down and demonstrates absolute grace. Kristy is also fun; she loves sports, of all things. She has tons of family members and loves dancing, too. For example, Kristy's mother works part-time for a living and also goes to school full-time. She and Mr. Thomas (Kristy's dad) adopted a little Vietnamese girl and she is an incredibly adorable kid. Oh, and they also adopted a little boy from Vietnam. His name is David Michael Thomas. That's an interesting story. Kristy's mom works, and I guess she'd like to be a cheerleader for some team someday. And there's Kristy's father, too. He moved out to California, just after David Michael arrived, and Kristy's mother had to move back to the house. Kristy has no steady stepsister or brother. She married this man who happens to be divorced, who has two kids — a boy named David Michael and a girl named Jill, who live in his house not long after David Michael but on alternate weekends). But things go on like they used to, except that Jill's family recently adopted two kids from the foster care system — Shannon and Josh — and now, even though Kristy's grandparents are divorced, Mrs. Thomas lives happily with her husband and baby brother (yes, she also has four kids, including triplets!). Plus, Shannon's one of those little kids that grow up and don't get used to being young and clumsy. She's cute and full of energy and enthusiasm for whatever she's doing. Jill's family also happens to be quite big. They moved here from Long Island, which is part-time, part-time, absolutely gorgeous. I mean, you could spend a weekend with them and still catch the breeze. There's nothing more spectacular than the Big Island Sound Sound,
