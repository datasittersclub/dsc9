======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 more baby sitters in Manhattan? It's sort of hard to tell by looking at our catalog — it only contains our top five baby-sitting jobs.

However, I had no choice in the matter. I had an idea.

I'd been looking through our catalog, and I'd had the idea.<|endoftext|>
As I walked into Claudia's bedroom I heard a terrific clunk. The phone rang pretty quickly. We called Claudia back and she answered. I heard the first phone call of the meeting: I told her which club I was on, and she said it was time to leave. I had only just begun my shift and had to say nice and sorry about what had gone wrong.

Claudia makes me feel great. I guess I was the first of my friends to become a member of the Baby-sitters Club. Then, too, I think that the BSC was great, because we had a lot of good ideas. We also had friends. And we had a lot of conflicts. But now there was room for everybody, and it seemed good to have someone who takes people and solves problems with pleasure.

I sat down near Claudia's desk, where I'd been assigned, and began writing in the BSC notebook. I knew I'd be writing more after each sitting job, to be in contact with the clients, and so I closed the notebook and continued my reading. I began reading and couldn't stop the clock from running down to five-thirty.

Okay, so I was in my notebook. I couldn't stop anyone else from reading it. That's okay, though, because the rest of my friends did. I just needed to make sure I wasn't reading any longer than I could concentrate. I closed the notebook and turned back to the clock.

I knew my friends would start reading when the bell rang. They'd all be writing in the notebook now. (Claudia's boyfriend, Logan Bruno, is super-fictive.) At some point, a job call came in, which I had to answer. I'd been looking forward to this for months and the phone would ring. It was a real call — for Claudia. Not only when she'd be home from a meeting, but every Tuesday and Thursday morning. I knew I'd be answering it. I was going to try to stay on schedule, even though the job was not on the calendar, and probably would not be. (Claudia's older sister, Janine, would never get an apartment. She'd have to live there before she could get an apartment herself.)

As if that weren't weird enough, I'd have to answer a job call from a different phone number, too. The rest of the BSC members have jobs in other countries, too.

“What’s the big deal,” Kristy said, taking a breath and looking at the clock. “The phone is ringing, and the meeting is on. We’re going to take care of the money today.”

Kristy looked up with a wry smile. “I’m going back to New York for vacation, I’m leaving the club, and the money is due. If we pay some of the money, we’ll have a new baby and we’ll get over it. Not to mention having my old job back.<|endoftext|>
I’ve never been one to complain about the weather, at least not at BSC meetings. I love the BSC, which is exactly what we plan for a baby-sitting business called BSC. If there’s any rain, snow, or bad weather, BSC members have plenty of good options, and parents get a fair amount of work. We are very organized, no matter what kind of rain.

My best experience with the BSC has been having the organization come to life. Since Kristy is a strong person and takes on lots of responsibilities (not only in managing finances), she manages to have one strong beginning point: Mom and Dad.

“Mom,” I said, taking a step closer to her.

“You can’t sit at your desk,” said her mother.

“You can’t.” I shrugged. I knew my mother would be so annoyed if I called her back (as I did occasionally).

“We’re both very busy,” Dad told her. “We don’t just have to worry about money. We can take care of each other’s business, whether we like it or not. In my opinion, that’s what makes us work-aholics. We’re both extremely disciplined and very ready to take on new business.”

As usual, my parents both agreed.
