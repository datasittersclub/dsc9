my friends would take the trip. So they could look for a vacation."

"It wouldn't be fair," Jessica muttered. "We were in such pain. It was kind of scary watching the clock run out."

"I guess what we were in such pain was when the bell rang," Claudia complained.

"No, it was not," Jessi said. "It was just two and a half minutes before I got home."

"The clock called to three-thirty," Claudia reported. "You know you're on time."

Claudia hung up the watch. "Well, we're in trouble," she reported. "It's the day after Christmas."

The whole meeting cracked up. And we cracked up. We cracked up. And we cracked up.

Kristy Thomas, the president of the BSC, always had a lot on her plate. She made sure we kept track of all our conflicts. She organized Kid-Kits, which we each took to great ends. She has two associate members (one male and one female) and a job client who lives in the city.

I don't know who the associate member is, but we call her Mary Anne, and she usually works in the hospitality office, just for the job. And, of course, Kristy is so busy with the club that she hardly ever pays attention to the things we can't cover.

Another member of the BSC was her older sister, Janine. Janine is a genius. She's an art student who studies at a school in Manhattan (the nearest big city). She's allergic to junk food and has to watch what she eats. The Kishis are a little wary of her — but only because she keeps a record book and a notebook. Janine is on the short side, but she's the shortest of the club's officers.

Janine has medium-length blonde hair, blue eyes, and the coolest smile — it always seems to come out of her blonde, almond-shaped permed eyes. She's going to be very artistic.

We are also very homogeneous. Kristy is a pretty easygoing person, but I think she would be the world's greatest designer. Her room is an all-time go-to, because her closet, which is all wide (which is funny, since I look like a model) and her notebook, which she invented, is a real place to stay.

So I think Kristy would be the world's greatest artist (and if you are rich, you always look great). And if you're poor, you look like a pig.

No, Kristy's not a pig. She's a really, really talented painter. She's got fantastic hair that looks like wild horses. And her eyes are as red and gorgeous as horse skin. She has this really amazing idea of what colors mean, and her room looks like the paintings you see in the movie Lion King.

I'd never seen Kristy act so artistic. If you ask her what the worst case might be, it's just a variation on a theme. Like Mal's dream of being a model, or Nicky's plan of getting in shape.

Kristy is totally creative. She's always putting together some kind of cool fashion statement — this long skirt, that cool little green turtleneck, this wild-colored tie-dyed sweater, that funky white-coated T-shirt and the whole mess of the little-kids' socks.

It's kind of hard to believe, but Claudia’s bedroom is not the only stuff in her room. The Junk Food Room is Kristy’s bedroom, because I know that’s where Kristy and her mom get the wildest ideas.

“I love it!” she says, making fun of the room.

“It’s full of junk food!” a neighbor complains.

“I love it!” Kristy responds.

“She was crazy about it,” the neighbor cries out.

“She used to have a million visits!” Abby adds.

I guess Kristy has her thoughts at the BSC. She’s a serious student, which is why she’s the only one of us who takes afternoon jobs.

“What do you think?” Mary Anne asks.

“I don’t know,” Kristy answers. “I’m so, so lucky. I’m going to be sitting for this whole BSC meeting soon!”

“Don’t you worry,” Abby offers. “There’s lots more we’ll be discussing.”

“Oh, absolutely! Yes.” Kristy is the world
