 over any other business than baby-sitting, and I couldn’t think of a better way to spend my time. And I had another major problem ahead of myself: the house was going to get really, really messy.

“The wheels on my bike start turning,” said Abby.

“Oh, my lord,” I began. “I can’t wait.”

We’d gotten off the bike and walked up the stairs to Grace’s house. We didn’t stop at any of Claudia’s many bedrooms, and not one of the wheels of the bike started turning.

I turned onto Grand Central. I stepped outside into the dark. I reached into the back of Claudia’s closet and pulled out a pair of dark denim shorts.

“Made in the U.S.A.” Claudia said, ripping open the bottom one. A small yellow bag was folded under the shorts to reveal a dark brown leather belt. I picked up the bag and handed it to Abby. “This is a great set of shorts,” Abby said.

Mary Anne reached into the shorts and pulled out a pair of tights. “An additional pair of black pants?”

Abby nodded. “They look great. The color is great.”

“Wow,” Mary Anne remarked. “It really is a new pair of pants. They look like shorts tailored to the color of their pants. I know they won’t be an issue for awhile.”

I sighed. There were small rashes all over the shorts. “Mary Anne, take a look at these. They’re so nice. They look great on you and your brothers and sisters.”

“Yeah!” Abby said, ripping open one of the dark jeans. “I’ll change it. The new pants are really bold. In these they’re a lot lighter in color than the old ones.”

“Wow,” I commented. “A crisp new look. Black, silver, and white.”

“Not as bold,” Mary Anne said. “Also not as cool as the new white colors.”

“So bold?” Abby asked. “I’d find out once I wear the new color pants, and all the looks I’ll get out of them will be bold.”

“Wow, more like bolder than that,” I commented.

“You might think that looks would show through in the new look.” Claudia teased. “I notice that the pants are not very tight. But they are okay.”

“That’s okay,” Mary Anne said.

“You do notice that?” Abby asked. “Yes.”

“Yeah?” I said. “This is what I expected.”

Abby and I looked at each other. Claudia and Mary Anne and Abby and I looked at each other. Then we said, “Okay, everybody. Here goes. This is what I got from my friend Cecelia.” I handed her the bag.

Kristy looked at me expectantly. “And this is what we got?”

“Right. In the purple pants we’d found at the flea market.”

“Ahem.”

“And we’ve been looking for a new pair of pants for a while now.” Claudia reached for the bag. “We’re not sure where we found them, but they're on Etsy. It’s not the same ones we’ve been looking for.”

“Etsy makes the same kinds of pants,” Mallory informed me. “I don’t know if they know it or not. All we know is that we’re going to need new pants.”

“New pants?” Kristy said. “Are they brand-new?”

“No.” I held up the bag. “The ones we found yesterday.”

“Great. You may pick a unique one that fits you like.”

I picked the two new pairs of pants, and Mary Anne picked one of the purple. “You want more?”

“My brothers and sisters, please.” I bowed out the ceremony and walked over to the bag. “Thanks. I’ll see you tomorrow, then.”
