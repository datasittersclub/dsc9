“Well, I’m doing what’s recommended by Mr. Thomas. Now, Mary Anne and Kristy will be here to sit. Then Shannon and me.”

Mary Anne rolled her eyes and sat up next to me. I wondered if she’d been chauffeured to the airport yet, but she always stays right at her home.

“Any news?” came a call from Dad on the phone. “I need a sitter for Andrew Porter and Shannon —”

I couldn’t help it, but suddenly I decided I had to go ahead and tell Dad about everything. I don’t want to disappoint him.

“We could call the airline the whole time.” The call rang again. I didn’t want to believe it had come from Dad. I didn’t want to go into it too seriously.

My mind raced.

“Hey, Dad. The airline wants me —”

I groaned. “I’ve got this great deal. In fact, they’ve told me that they’ve decided to let me board them and fly to Paris.”

I groaned again.

I was so mad that I almost lost my thoughts.

My mind raced.

“What?” Dad asked me at last minute that we weren’t having an airline ride.

I nodded. “I could fly.”

“All my friends do.”

“We could take a coach and board a plane, too.”

“Maybe.”

“All free.”

“You might as well make an appointment with a doctor or something,” said Dad. “All right, Dad, and I can check. We can take off for a while.”

I nodded again, and with my head held high I jumped up to see what was going on. A red-and-white television camera man sat there, taking a look at everything, as I did when I first saw the plane. I couldn’t remember how I would do that before. Dad must have known, since when did he use the news camera?

I couldn’t believe it.

“That will be a pleasure to have,” I began. “Just in case.” I was happy to be a guest of honor, at least when you can fly as well as you and be as free as Andrew.

“Yeah …”

I looked at my bracelet. It was a new one on the market. I was getting it for myself. The receiver said it would be for a Baby-sitters Club meeting in about five minutes.

It was probably very nice. I would probably have to spend another day of my life in Paris, which was where I’d be sitting.

I got the job.

I was about to get married. (I had a ceremony to mark.)

And I got back to Stoneybrook. I had just lived across the street from the house where I’d been born.

I was glad to be back. And I had so much more to lose.

Maybe someday I would be married again.

“Well?” I began. “I mean, we can talk on the phone for a while, but we won’t get to the point.”

“I know,” said Dad, “but we all know that if this is the case, we will lose our jobs.”

“I don’t think so,” said Mary Anne, “but it is going to be a lot better than I’ve realized.”

I sighed. I could see my parents’ heads were turning again.

“I would lose my job if this occurred to me,” I said thoughtfully. “I don’t know anyone and I don’t want to die alone in my new home. I’m so tired of living in this horrible, horrible, horrible place. Anybody who visits me will always be there, and I believe that’s what I’ll miss the most.”

Dad shook his head in silence. I was too excited to think about anything else at the moment.

“I guess we should talk about it later,” I said. “We haven’t talked about it all year.”

“But I can’t we a week?”

“I’ll call you back,” said Dad.
