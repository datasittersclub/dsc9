 said after the game, that I was looking forward to it every day. I was so proud of her.

In between games, I'd often spend hours sitting cross-legged with Claudia (she's our junior officer). The two of us talk by phone during the pregame warm-ups. Then I tell her about my experience in Stoneybrook. We also talk about who should win next. She laughs that my team had to be so advanced, because we had already won seven out of eight games. I'm a great horse, I promise.

Our first game together was when I fell in love with Sharon. Suddenly Sharon was a real big girlfriend. I went crazy. Then we fell in love. Sharon had become my best friend. We fell in love again, too, and soon I was married again. Sharon, not kidding, was the only one who was my neighbor and father, and my aunt Cecelia (who lives on the other side). They were our two neighbors â€” not a romantic one! I told Sharon I loved her. We fell in love sooooo fast that we fell out of love again.

We have two little kids of our own.

One of them is eleven! I used to miss her terribly, but now she's so much better than what I am (her father and mother died when she was a baby). Sharon is our second best friend.

I also recently became a father. I met the husband of Kristy's boyfriend, who is a millionaire and still lives in Stamford, New York. Since I love Kristy, I can afford to have lots of extra family. We decided to split up to live on Mary Anne's side (where I grew up), so Kristy (and Mary Anne, who is my best friend in the world) wouldn't be able to visit (she moved her mother back to New York to live with her dad). You know what? I just love my father a lot. He's a little bossy sometimes and he's been good to me. You see, I live about an hour away from Kristy's neighborhood. It's her place to be if the weather is freezing. The only time I have to get in contact with Kristy is when it's a rainy day when our kids are playing with the Kishis. No one really likes that, but Kristy loves being in contact with people (she calls this an eight-hour commute). She's so romantic about sports (she's a great skater) and romantic about her parents (she loves horses). As you can imagine, she's very busy, since she's a junior officer in her first job in the club.

We also take short rides and sometimes have to make our own food.

"I know, baby," I said, looking at her.

"Just think about what you'd do," Mary Anne said.

Shannon (she's one of the members of Kristy's new band, the Ramseys!) shook her head but kept her calm.

"Let's do something," Mary Anne suggested. "Maybe we might get together and take a break, and have a little nap and go home."

She listened to me tell her about the band she started and about how it was different from the regular Ramseys. Then she said, "We've been playing the music since before Kristy was born."

Shannon was singing, "Well, I didn't realize this would work before Kristy was born."

"We started playing until I was almost thirteen," Mallory added.

"What?" Abby asked. They all started singing.

"I don't know," Mallory said. "It was just sort of funny, it sounded like he could sing too." She continued, "But we were doing everything right, and we thought I might lose a baby to this. So, I started singing and singing and singing, and then you know, I started to lose my baby."

Abby, Dawn, and Mary Anne all turned their ears up. Mallory sang.

Stacey sang well.

Logan Bruno took second. He was a junior officer and Mary Anne was a member of our band, The Ramseys.

"I've got to say that I was looking forward to this," Stacey said. "I'd like to be able to take a little break and talk to my father about something. I feel so much connection to him. I'd like to get back to this time when we were very different, and why I love him, and have him consider it a baby."

Mary Anne and Logan both groaned in pain.

Abby (who is so good-looking and has long, curly, dark hair) took a deep breath. Suddenly, Logan said, "You've got to do something."

"It might as well be me," Mary Anne agreed.

"I'm going
