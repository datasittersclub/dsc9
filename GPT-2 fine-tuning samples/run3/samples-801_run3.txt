. So there is a lot of variety there, we all want to have a good laugh.

“That’s good,” said Mal. “It makes the kids laugh.”

Jessi opened the club notebook. She wrote a summary of all our sitting jobs:

“Thursday — at my desk.”

Jessi’s neat, dry handwriting didn’t seem to mind and she was free to read any more of the entries if she wanted to.

In fact, she likes to write in the notebook. Sometimes Jessi and Mal write in quick succession. When we’re not taking baby-sitting jobs, we’ll be writing in the club notebook. Each of us knows how the others do things. As junior officers, we’re supposed to be reading the entries as soon as they’re readmitted. This is not a habit we have to follow. Sometimes we do wish we’d seen the entries before we signed up for the jobs. Just saying anything will only make things worse. ’Oh, well, our club is running today. Sort of, I guess, my style.”

Jessi’s neat, dry handwriting isn’t something we want to mess up our jobs too often. In fact, we don’t want Jessi's to feel guilty about it and she still writes in the notebook whenever we’re sure she’ll be free to take a sitting job. I think that kind of self-promotion in a situation like this just means that Jessi has to work hard to please everyone but me and Mal, the rest of the members of the club. We are all pretty casual about our jobs so we aren’t sure how it looks or works.

I wonder if you’re all shy around, especially at meetings or after school or on weekends.

Jessi is a ballet dancer too. My best friend and best friend on the dance stage are the same age, eleven. We don’t talk on the phone much, but that’s what makes us special friends. We each have our own strengths and weaknesses. We are very different in some ways and very different in others. For example, who I am? I like to say she and I look alike, even though in fact I am both pretty different.

Actually, I am pretty different in some ways, although I do deal with some stereotypes. For example, aside from my big chest, I also have thick, reddish-brown hair, dark eyes and doe-like feet. I’d probably grow a necktie or something if my hair were any bit more ponytail. I wear my hair short, which isn’t at all wacky anymore, and I wear a little makeup at night, but it’s pretty ordinary. So on my dresser, you see the usual suspects — jeans, a turtleneck, a sweater, and maybe the tie-dyed tights. I wear jeans, sweaters, and sneakers a lot because that’s my only true style.

What does one person have to do to become an expert at another person’s? Organization. That’s what. Jessi and I got that from our gym class. We took the test and we passed. But what was the most important thing we learned? The art of organizing information.

Jessi and I are both talented. Jessi’s creative. She wants to be a professional violinist. Not only is she studying after-school violin for awhile, but she’s also been studying ballet for awhile. We agreed to give each other minor updates on our violin practices. We also talked about what was going on with Jessi’s new ballet project. (Minor changes are always good.)

We’ve been friends since we were in diapers, and we grew up together. I told Jessi and her family a long time ago, and we still talk with each other. Some of the things we say are less than helpful, because we think it amounts to teasing, even against our friends. For example, Jessi raised three little kids (she has two older ones, one younger) on her own, with her own “name and address. When we started our business, we got a lot of phone calls, and we were able to use the business to our advantage. We became instant friends.

Jessi is different from me in several ways. I could name the things she hates the most — school, economics, junk food. But she doesn’t. Here is what she hates: Stacey McGill, our treasurer, hates studying fees, although I suspect that she is especially dreading them. In fact, Stacey’s house is almost certainly over in a minute. She’s the only one
