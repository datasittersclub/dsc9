�? “She’s in the locker room!” the voice said, holding up an Iced Tea bag. I thought it was Professor Richard, the head librarian.

“That’s right.” I burst out laughing. “It is really great to be back in your old age!”

“Great,” said the rest of the world. My fellow vampires burst out laughing at me. I was in my old age. I’d been in some really bad ones.<|endoftext|>
I reached into my backpack, opened the bottom drawer of my desk drawer, and pulled out two pairs of oversized, faded high-top khaki shorts. I had ripped one off the top and stuck it backward on the shorts. The other was folded in half, the opening was made at the back, and two short pieces of denim sat in the back pocket.

The two pairs of shorts belonged to Shannon and Logan, Kristy’s ten-year-old jaguar sisters. (They’re sisters; Kristy’s eight-year-old squirt dog.) The two pairs arrived one evening when Kristy’s mother and Kristy’s father were looking through their Dad’s temporary divorce. In the moment, Kristy took her mother and five older brothers to their cousin's house and made them pets.

Before they left, Mrs. Thomas realized that being a single parent was no excuse for not having enough kids. She organized a number of jobs for the weekend; one assistant special assistant for each job. Of course, the men and the dogs would all miss their jobs, so the brothers played with the surplus dogs. When the dogs settled down, Kristy gave the team owner two jobs. The first one to go, the winner was announced.

There she was: Kristy Thomas alone in the kitchen, with her two younger sisters, Janine and Tia, filling in for Janine after Janine’s spayed or neutered — Janine, who has diabetes, doesn’t like Stacey, and the boys don’t like Stacey too much.

“I’ll let you pick your own outfit,” she told Janine. “I’ll wear a little — khakis, a black blouse and a pink sweater. You can’t have too many.”

“I’ll try on some polka dot socks,” Janine supplied.

We switched to Day-two of grumbling and complaining, with Mrs. Thomas making her first announcement — that Mary Anne Wollhouse would soon visit. Mrs. Thomas didn’t mind that much as much as Kristy did.

“Dues can't wait until the next meeting,” said Kristy. “Can they buy new things?”

The treasury envelope was packed with money. It had been the two dollars that had taken Mary Anne’s and the Wolls’ expenses into account.

“See you then.”

“See you then.” We bowed our heads in thanks. Mary Anne scanned the paper for the denomination in our club’s record book. “This Tuesday,” she informed us, “the next regular meeting is scheduled. Our clients know they can call us at their Monday afternoons from seven-thirty until six. With the appointment you’ll be sure to pick up appointments straight from our office.”

Stacey called Mrs. Thomas back to tell her that Mrs. Korman would be at the meeting.

While the Kormans waited, their three brothers and sisters gathered in Claudia Korman’s room to gab at the paper for the next two weeks. This would cause Claud’s parents to call a timeout and get the children back to their parents. They would have to pay a thousand dollars a month for a phone and a private phone number to collect, process, and package the baby-sitting work.

They were right; the Kormans were in desperate need of sitters. Kristy told us to call our parents up and ask them to make a new appointment. Mary Anne arranged the junk-food for the job and then announced the schedule of our jobs. When the numbers became clear, Kristy said she would call, but only if the caller ID was Stacey McGill.

We all hung up, though. Stacey and her twin sister, Anna, were already booked on Thursday so we had time to wait for the remaining four BSC members.

Claudia picked up a big poster printed with a picture of a bubble bath. “Can anyone tell me who could make one?” she asked.

“I think
