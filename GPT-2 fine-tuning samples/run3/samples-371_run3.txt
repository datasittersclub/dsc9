y for the long walk home, so I did exactly as Kristy suggested. Stacey was a real baby-sitter who was also very thoughtful and sensitive, even a little bit sentimental.

I was so happy I cried a lot.

Jessi and Mallory had already set things straight when they came back to Stoneybrook, so I guess it was a pretty mature scene. (The truth is, the truth is they always look like they know something, but I don't think they know how to dress.) In fact, with time I've learned a lot from what happened at Stoneybrook Middle School. As you can guess by now, some things have changed in the school since I first left. Mr. Thomas (who was my best friend from seventh grade before I realized how different he was from me) and Ms. Thomas (the other one) have become more mature. Mr. Thomas, who used to be a baby-sitter, is now a full-time student at the Watson Center, so he has two full-time jobs, and the Hobart Middle School kids are still learning how to read and write. Also, I gained a stepbrother, so Jessi and Mal (both thirteen) are in a foster family now. They just happen to be younger than the rest of us, and they're in our eighth grade — the same age as our two older brothers. Both Jessi and Mal were born here, here, in New York City. Until recently, it was my home, not theirs. But now, two years ago, just outside of Manhattan, both boys met the Stevenson family (who themselves moved into their house) in Long Island (the same place where I lived).

Like me, Jessi and Mal are pretty different on the surface, but they are just the same — they're alike in every way. The Stevenson kids adore horses and books, and they’re totally interested in fashion and baby-sitting. Jessi and Mal like to read, too, and the Stevenson kids just adore their older brother. Jessi, on the other hand, is a dancer. Now, even her parents hate dancing, since they thought she was ugly and clumsy with her brown hair and her curly red hair. But like me, they like her to be independent.

So now, with all that in mind, lets start my first section together. It will tell you about a group of thirteen eighth-graders my best friend and I have been talking about since seventh grade began.

This section was originally going to contain a description of the BSC. I think my friends should know I have more to say about the boys and girls of my time, including how they became my friends and the club. We had been living in our room during eighth grade (I think) while Mr. and Mrs. McGill were looking through a magazine that featured a story about their new baby-sitting business.

I began to wonder if my friends might try to make some kind of a pretense for not being in a club anymore. How is it possible to become part of a big family and still do the things that I do?

I knew that they could. They’ve been living with some pretty awful parents for awhile now. It was a dream come true for them. Kristy’s mom died when they were very young, and Kristy’s dad lived near Kristy’s little brother. Mrs. Thomas used to come to these meetings, which is how we met them. We sometimes read about the old house in the paper when it was just a few blocks away. (They still use to buy newspaper for the kids.)

Kristy’s mom died when she and Mr. Spier were in California, so Kristy’s dad didn’t visit. He died right in her arms. Fortunately, Kristy’s mom was very smart, but she hasn’t been back ever since. Since then her IQs have improved a lot, but I think math teachers haven’t adjusted to her new way of life.

Kristy’s great, she’s funny, and she’s good at sports. She was so stubborn and not interested in baby-sitting. Then she met Watson Brewer, who is his whole family’s mom! They fell in love with each other and got married. Then they started making trips to Watson’s house every month for the kids, which was a disaster. Then a new kind of dad came along, which was great because Kristy found out about Watson. Then she had to look up, and she discovered that Watson has diabetes. That’s when her family developed a big family — and Kristy and her friends are going to need a big family to survive in Watson’s new world.

The BSC has seven regular members. Kristy says they can hardly wait to have
