======== SAMPLE 1 ========
i’s got a job at the airport, and she’s on vacation in Hawaii. (She and Dawn are stepsisters, although their parents have separated. We don’t want to cause any tension.)

Kristy lives, too. She loves to read and to write. When I was little, Kristy was not interested in reading, but instead wrote and performed sketch stories, which later became books. Now she’s writing, too — but not very well. So much so that her mother remarried, giving her the title of Mrs. Incredible. Her grandmother Mimi and her two brothers moved in to help take care of some kids.

I’ve been to school a lot and talked to a lot of kids. Most of them seem to be happy now. And lots of them seem happy. A lot of it is positive. It’s just that the teachers (I’ll tell you about them one more time, please!) have changed. Kristy’s problem — her speech — has mostly been handled by the BSC. Now she’s allowed to wear Nikes for meetings, so long as she’s wearing her hair professionally. This doesn’t always happen, though, because Kristy has a problem with boys and she’s also stubborn.

But Kristy is not a loudmouth, and so she is often bossy. And not just bossy.

“What will happen to the baby if it grows up fast?” Mary Anne suggested.

We shook our heads. Mary Anne, who is very cool about curly, bright hair, turned back to Mary Anne for more information, and asked if she had any ideas. Mary Anne nodded, then asked about the twins. “What do you need a name for them?” Mary Anne asked.

“Who would you call my boyfriend?” asked Kristy.

“Kristy’s the one,” Kristy said thoughtfully. “The one who had to convince you not to see them. They’re adorable.”

“They’re little kids from Kristy’s neighborhood,” Mary Anne said. “It’s easy for her to be outspoken and try to please everyone with her big mouth.”

“What if the other people in the world could taste my jokes?” Mary Anne asked.

“I’ll do it myself,” Kristy replied.

“I’ll write my words on a book,” Mary Anne said. “And I’ll keep a poster of my famous little sister framed over one of the big picture covers. That’s what it’s for.”

“Oh,” said Kristy, passing her some gum, which she passed out of the conversation as she explained her experience.

 “Okay.” The phone rang almost as soon as it said. Mary Anne and Kristy exchanged a look, then shook their heads. Mary Anne was sitting at her desk, and she was reading from a book. “All right, Mrs. McGill. We’ll call you right back, so check it out.”

Mary Anne frowned. “How about this?”

“I heard that Jeff is going to be going to Hawaii.”

“Jeff,” Mary Anne spoke. “He’ll be in a tropical island vacation once a year.”

This shocked Mary Anne, since she’s read that story before. “Oh, my lord.”

Mary Anne looked at Mary Anne, who is silent these days. “I wish my parents could call me that.”

“Do you mean “that’s not my real name?” asked Kristy.

“Well,” said Mary Anne quickly, “that name comes up every time we go to Hawaii.”

“Oh, no. You don’t say that.”

“I mean,” added Mary Anne. Then she said, “My name would be Jeff. And I’m not going. I guess I’ll be right back.”

“All right. All right.” Mary Anne checked her record book, which contains names, addresses, and phone numbers of our regular clients. She also checks her math book, in which she keeps a calendar of all our baby-sitting jobs.

“Hi!” I said when Mary Anne opened the record book again and started writing down our jobs again.

“My name’s Jeff.”
