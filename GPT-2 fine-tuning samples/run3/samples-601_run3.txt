 to the club and become honorary members, and so on.

It was as if the time were running out. At the beginning of seventh grade, Mrs. Cummings began to experience a severe case of chemotherapy. She had developed severe lymphadenopathy the day after she and I had eaten at the same table. It wasn’t too bad because it was getting pretty bad for her. But over time it became so bad that she missed visits from her family, and she hardly ever was able to come to meetings.

Back to Mrs. Cummings. During summer Kristy’s family moved into her old farmhouse and had trouble raising two kids — Andrew and Karen — on their own. Kristy and her family eventually began raiding the Cummings household for sitters. I was surprised to see them so unhappy when I first met them at that farmhouse, but you know what? They’re pretty much like sisters. (Karen is only an infant, Kristy is a little smaller.)

Well, they’re pretty much sisters now, too. Kristy’s the opposite. She’s outgoing and has a great sense of humor. And I almost wished my mom could be outgoing and funny. But she isn’t, and Kristy is more like Mary Anne, friendly, and outgoing. In fact, she’s so adorable that it’s funny, and very funny. She’s the opposite of Kristy's gorgeous, long, blonde hair. She wears glasses because her family has changed radically, and she wants to take a more active, active and fashionable career, such as advertising or publicity.

Here’s what I liked about Mary Anne: She loves sports. Mary Anne’s neighbor is an athlete, so she visits her more often than I’ve told you she’s gorgeous. She doesn’t even look like the stereotype of a big-shot athlete. Like Kristy, Mary Anne’s a cheerful person, with the energy and enthusiasm to be president of a baby-sitting organization.

You already know Mary Anne’s a little-kids’s person. I’m sure you’d like her the most when you meet her. She’s tall with long, strong arms and legs, and she looks like a doll.

I’ve already told you a little about Mary Anne, since I’ll tell you about all the friends she has. Before Kristy and I got married, Mary Anne’s mom died, and now she has eight younger, younger brothers and sisters. I’m sure she still has a long, long house to support her family.

Mary Anne’s father remarried — to his former high school sweetheart’s brother — to become a millionaire! Who cares what the old high-school sweetheart’s name is? Kristy thought of it.

Okay, so maybe Mary Anne is quiet and absentminded. She is also a tomboy, which means she is absentminded. And you know what? She cries at anything.

So, to tell you the truth, I think Mary Anne is one of the youngest members of the BSC. I don’t know if I’d ever date her, but Mary Anne is adorable. She has longish brown hair, brown eyes, and long, dark, curly, dark hair that she wears all the time. She’s got pierced ears and her glasses are no use unless she wants to buy earrings — which she doesn’t —”

“What do you call a boy?” asked Mary Anne as she sank to the floor, her cheeks flushed, just her chin on her hands. Then she asked, “Who’s prettiest?”

“Mary Anne!” said Kristy.

“Oh, I see,” murmured Mary Anne.

“Yeah, I’m,” she said.

“And you know what?” demanded Mary Anne. “I’ve been calling you a boy and calling you a girl, all day.”

“Yes, and you know what?” asked Kristy.

“You call me that.”

“Is that all, like, a little of that time I guess?”

“Yeah. And, you know, ‘boys and girls.’”

“And call me Tigger.”

Then Mary Anne looked at me and said in her deep voice, “What did you say?”

“Oh, I have the word 'boys' and 'girls,' in my room,” said Kristy. “What do you mean
