 Kristy and I watched her get used to the phone, which didn't seem too bad. It was not until Kristy was sitting next to the window, listening to Mary Anne's phone call, that we realized how busy the kids were. We asked Kristy if she could make it all the way to Stoneybrook to get them. She nodded.

“Hey. We’ve got several things going on today. Can’t wait for today’s meeting.” Mary Anne told herself as she headed downstairs and into the hallway. Mary Anne is one of the hardest working kids in our lives. How can I explain? Well, I can’t. We work more than usual. We’ve got jobs so our parents won’t mind. It’s just easy to lose track of what is going on with them.

“Okay. Can’t wait until tomorrow to call.” Sunny was sitting at the table next to Mary Anne, trying to be professional and organized while we waited.”

“We can’t wait for tomorrow’s meeting.” Sunny smiled at Mary Anne.

“But we can’t wait for meetings.<|endoftext|>
“Dawn.” Dawn called to her father after her mother returned to work, telling him she missed their meeting. Mr. Krusztak wanted a doctorate student and wanted Mrs. Spier to carry him there, but Dawn said she could only be with Mrs. Spier.

That was when Mrs. Spier and Dawn met up with Jessi and Karen. Jessi was a new mother, who hadn’t returned to the house since Kristy had moved here, and her mom lived in an old house near Dawn’s. It’s a house that has a lot of history so it’s not too different as far as looking in the windows. But Dawn decided, who knows, maybe she’s going to see her dad, if she goes back there again. So Jessi returned to her house on Valentine’s Day.

Mrs. Spier and Dawn’s father were looking forward to the meeting, and Jessi could hardly wait to be there. Then Dawn remembered to call her after the meeting the last time she left. Jessi missed the meeting so much that she had to take her baby.

I don’t blame her, Dawn. It didn’t help that her father (another millionaire) was divorced. She was going through what has to be the hardest period ever in her life, and I think her life is pretty good.

She also gets used to being called a boss. Even though she has been doing everything right, her bossy behavior is not easy for Dawn. She can usually be the one bossing her (you can tell because the whole time Mrs. Spier keeps telling Dawn that she isn’t bossy) but she’s not that way when she feels like she is. Mrs. Spier is the leader of a department that goes into a room and tries to find out all kinds of things that she can’t do alone (such as putting a baby in a box, giving a teddy bear to a stranger and calling for more supplies for Kristy’s room).

I had to tell them to call me back at seven-thirty or something, which is too late. They called Stacey from the city and they were like, "Dawn, it’s five-thirty!”

I thought that sounded gross, and I’d have to get the last word. Then I heard Mrs. Spier laughing hysterically as she made her announcement.

Mrs. Spier was sitting across from me in Claud’s room on Claudia’s rug. She took out a card from a card book and flipped through it. “My number is Kristy’s — my card company. I think this is an awful idea.” She read it, then flipped it over and repeated the question. “Dawn, we could contact you right then — right NOW — I’M looking for a dentist on standby for your baby on the last day we baby-sit in the month of May. This would be the shortest amount of time we baby-sit if you asked me.”

Kristy looked angry. I guess that was fine with her, but Mrs. Spier was starting to worry about the dentist.

“You’re calling one dentist a few minutes away?” she said, “How often do you think about it?”

I told her about the BSC. We were running a baby-sitting program in a little city in Stoneybrook that was run for about six
