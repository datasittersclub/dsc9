 up into the bedroom and we listen to the music to tell each other who's free that day. We're pretty relaxed because we all have our own ideas and tastes. We're free to do what we want with our free time.

Another thing we do with our free time is read books. We read Emily Dickinson and Byron and the classics. We read Nancy Drew and everything. And when we do come across good stuff, we try to take advantage of it and read it. But that kind of frees us up, which makes for a lot of fun. We really miss writing and illustrating things, so you might think that would be hard on us. But it can be. We're so sensitive to the fact that we can be, and we think it's great to be free.

When it comes to sports, we can be extremely competitive. We often compete against the best kids in our school gym (the Kishis are the best), with the best coaches and best record of any club. We know how to compete — and we sometimes even win a championship.

I don't think I've ever told you about Kid-Kits. Kid-Kits are boxes full of games, stickers, and other kid-related art supplies. They're like a zoo but smaller and more dynamic. We even decorated them, but kids wouldn't even notice. Kid-Kits are great for keeping kids entertained, but we also know there are other ways to spend our free time.

Some of our most popular businesses are Kid-Kits. They're also huge win-win for our business. In addition to our regular club, Kid-Kit and kits are also in the club treasury, where we're guaranteed a few hundred dollars for each use of each box. That's great for keeping track of how much money we're saving on things we don't need.

The Club

It started out as a club. Claudia Kishi, who is one of Mary Anne's best friends, came up with the idea when she was really sick and needed a reliable, experienced, responsible parent. Now that the Baby-sitters Club is booming, her idea has spread all over the world that parents can come and help baby-sit for free.

Well, the club is the brainchild of Mary Anne Spier and her good friends, Claudia and Kristy. They think parents should have the right to take over their own parents' businesses, so they have started to take on bigger and bigger businesses. We all have a part of the club, but it's mainly used for official business, such as Kristy's art show. Now, if parents want to sit for a children's game, for instance, their club members can fill the job. They can also call Kristy's company to set up business meetings.

Another club member is Shannon Kilbourne, who lives in Kristy's new neighborhood. She and Mary Anne's mom started the club partly as a way for Kristy to keep track of the bills, and partly to help keep her busy. Although she wasn't the only club member to make an impression at the beginning, the rest of us took turns starting the club from the get-go.

What Stands Out

Kristy — she has a great Southern accent — came up with the idea for the Kid-Kits in the first place. Her mother is from Stoneybrook and she used to live right across the street from Claudia. Her father died when Kristy and her mom moved to Stoneybrook.

Mary Anne grew up there, but her family split up when the Thomases went back to New Jersey. Then she met Watson Brewer, who had already moved back to NYC. (It is also easy to find this person in the Stoneybrook community.) Watson came back to Stoneybrook soon after he landed a job at Macy's, so Mary Anne got to live with him for some time. Now Kristy and her family is back together, and Watson's been great to Mrs. Kishi and her kids — Mary Anne is now a full-time resident of Kristy's neighborhood.

Mary Anne is the first black member of the BSC. She came of age in black households, like mine, but then it became clear that she didn't have the same kind of family as me. She had seven younger brothers and sisters. The ones who lived next door to us lived with them for almost a full year. Then Watson's kids (Sam and Charlie) moved into their parents' new family. (The second they moved in, the others moved away. They're part of an organization called Young Black Kids Club, also in New York City.) The new members came to help out, which was interesting. They also helped out a lot — Mary Anne and Claudia even got to play with some of their old friends — but they have to make some tough decisions. I'm not kidding. When Kristy came to the BSC, she said her
