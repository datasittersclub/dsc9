ia? “This is a good day when you can visit your dad in the hospital.”

“So I guess I’m back right on my regular schedule, I guess,” Abby murmured.

“That’s the big thing,” said Stacey. “He's going back to the hospital. He still needs to go.”

“He was fine the first time,” said Dawn. “He’s pretty sure he’ll be out for some time, though.”

Abby and her mom are divorced, but Stacey and her mom are still friends. Because of the fact that Stacey is an independent genius, she lives in an apartment across town from Mr. and Mrs. Schafer. (It’s a weird fact, because it’s more like the Big Apple with the most crazy people. Some people think that’s because they live too far from Stoneybrook, for example.)

Stacey, though, is more independent than I am.

Our club treasurer is Kristy. She keeps our money in our personal accounts. That’s a great way of keeping track of how much we have. Payday, for example. The main reason we use a record book is to help us keep track of paying clients. That includes paying dues, which we use to help pay Claudia’s new phone bill, and stuff like that.

I knew Abby would like me to join her because, well, Kristy is a total social-justice freak. I’ve had several boyfriends in the past few years, but since then I’ve only had to deal with two, and they’re mostly older boys (Jessi and Adam are our junior officers, and Mal and I are thirteen). Kristy would probably like to date one someday, since she’s a math whiz. She’s also a terrific artist, and I can see myself in her bedroom as a professional sculptor someday.

Even though Kristy has a great sense of style (she’s about the same height as me), I don’t think she thinks her nose is a little too big. (I’m the shyest one in the eighth grades.) Or that she likes to dress in a uniform. (If you notice, Kristy has a killer habit of wearing tights. She dresses in jeans and a turtleneck, and when she walks into a store I like, she usually goes on the turtleneck with the belt on one leg.) Kristy will definitely win the Becca category.

Our meeting began at 5:30 and I began the meeting at Claudia’s door. That’s because everyone had arrived — Mr. Kishi, Mrs. Thomas, Dawn, Jessica Ramsey, and Mallory Pike, our associate club members — and had gotten their ears pierced.

“Well, it’s about time, Kristy, we start out with you.” Mrs. Thomas began to stroke one of her club necklaces after another, as if being pierced meant that she was going to cry overnight.

“It’s okay, Kristy, and we can just rest easy,” Mrs. Thomas said. She held the jewelry out to me when it came to teasingly.

After all that teasing, we’d decided the meeting wasn’t ready yet, even though we weren’t entirely well. There are lots of club meetings and it’s always a busy time for us club members, especially junior officers.

“Meeting to meet,” Kristy said. “You and I could do it.”

“I’m in the club to take care of business,” Abby said.

But wait! There was more! We were all groaning as we took the Pike steps again.

I was about to drop my chin when I heard a clunk and a knock on Claudia’s bedroom door, and I heard a knock on Mary Anne’s bedroom door. “Hi, everybody!” I said to the others as they ran into the room.

“We’re still hungry,” Stacey chided as we raced into Claudia’s closet.

“We could use some rest for you guys, then,” Claudia said as she dug a little behind Claud's bed and tapped my foot on the staircase. “Sure. We could sit for you guys, then, and watch your brothers and sisters, and be around each other’s dogs all day, it’s worth it.”

Before we could say anything else about what had happened that day, Stacey arrived at the door and
