 schedules to keep track of the jobs (and expenses).

As secretary of the BSC, I take a lot of the jobs seriously. If there's anything I should know about them before we start a meeting, I call Claudia, Kristy, Mary Anne, and Stacey. We figure out which of us is available before the other members begin plotting their own meetings.

I'm vice-president if the BSC doesn't offer a meeting date.

Kristy is my best friend. Back when I was thirteen, I was thirteen and she was nine. I have a theory that Kristy would be the first one with a steady supply of reliable baby-sitters. She wouldn't let herself get cornered by too many baby-sitters. She does like talk shows, especially Big Ideas.

Kristy used to think that every job was its own private phone line, the official headquarters of the BSC. Now she has changed her mind completely. But I think she still sees baby-sitting as a job where everyone is required to have a phone with a line to reach all of our sitting business.

Kristy lives in Kristy's front yard, with her two older brothers (Charlie is fifteen and Sam is six) and her baby brother, David Michael. Then came David Michael. Kristy's mom died for a true, long distance baby-sitter — Kristy's mom got her. And it was a long way from her (she used to live on Long Island).

Now her dad is divorced and she lives with her mother.

We use these two neighbors as callers, instead of Kristy as treasurer. If we have more work than Kristy can do, she'll call and set aside a job for us.

I think Kristy is the only member of the club with a steady steady boyfriend. He's Logan Bruno, just like Mallory and me. That's because Kristy's family has been a whirlwind of changes since she's been in the eighth grade. Kristy's mom first moved to Stoneybrook when her dad took over for a long time, especially Mr. Thomas. Kristy's dad just happens to be a millionaire! And guess who also happens to be Kristy's other best friend? That's Kristy's stepsister. They're in such a large part of the family that they almost always take our afternoon jobs, which are in addition to the regular three-sitters we give ourselves.

Kristy and I were in the midst of getting ready to move across country in one of the most unique, unusual things I'd ever seen. We were already in California and were planning our next move.

Well, before I did anything too major, I remembered something. It was the letter the BSC sent me. It said. “Dear Mr. and Mrs. Papadakis,” it went on, “we received this letter from Mrs. Papadakis.” Mrs. Papadakis loves you and wants to have you on the job soon. The Papadakowskys are also very close. During her visit we mentioned we were moving to Stoneybrook. “I’ll be able to sit for her and see what she makes of you guys,” Mrs. Papadakis announced excitedly. She went on to reveal that she and the Papadakowskys had just had a baby.

“It’s the Papadakska Baby-sitters Club!” Claudia and I exclaimed.

Claud’s voice had changed. “Oh, my gosh!” she exclaimed, “This letter from Mrs. Papadakis is so moving. It’s so touching!”

I thought a letter like that would send all sorts of people running for the door. Fortunately for everybody, Claudia and I landed on the floor. (Claud is the BSC’s alternate officer, which means she takes over the duties of any officer who should have to make a mistake in a meeting.)

I looked right at Claud. “We could sit for any of you,” Claudia explained. We did, and Claud had the best idea of what to do with all of us. She wrote Mrs. Papadakis an e-mail as soon as it hit her.

“Thank you so much,” Claud said. “I really appreciate it.”

Claudia hung up the phone and looked at Mary Anne. "Can you call Mrs. Papadakis back?" she asked.

Mary Anne replied with a long pause. Then she hung up and started pouting. Claudia knew she was bossy. She often felt as if her room were a joke. "That’s it," she snarled.

“You’re not going to try to call her back, Mary
