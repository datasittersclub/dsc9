======== SAMPLE 1 ========
'd’t ever kissed a girl. I've always loved it when my mother takes care of me. She always has a pretty steady supply of hot cocoa on hand — and she’s even looked my dad in the eye several times a week since I was little.

Jessi has the biggest, bluest eyes, and she’s a health-food nuts fan. Her favorite dish is tofu, which is a kind of tofu dip that my family is very familiar with. But Jessi also has a taste for health foods that aren’t as overwhelming as tofu. She’ll never make tofu or google, only jalapeños that are mild-to-cure, like quetzine. A tofu bowl looks just like a bag of chips, though, since tofu has a special place in my heart.

Jessi is African-American, with blonde hair and almond-shaped eyes. One day she was making a friend of Kristy’s, and she and her father (who is white) decided that they were going to be best friends, and they decided to stay best friends until the new member got her. (Kristy used to date Mary Anne, but she’d grown tired of her.) But that’s not how it works now. That’s when Stacey got involved, and then Dawn’s dad left California for good (although that is a long story).

Then, things got out of hand a little, for some reason. That’s when Stacey and Mary Anne decided that they’d decided what they wanted. In a flash, Mary Anne’s family moved across town to Stacey’s, so it made sense that Stacey wanted to work at a job in California.

Then, the summer before our wedding, Dawn got married — and everybody.<|endoftext|>
"This weekend is going to be fun," Kristy said. "But I also feel like the BSC should be much more involved in having a big, big BSC meeting."

Dawn and I settled into our chairs near the foot of my bed, in our regular timespan, and Kristy and I started to talk about what we’d wanted to do.

"Bummer," I said. "I mean, I mean, I’m the last girl at school who’s allergic to both sugar and chocolate. And I know Stacey is too. She would probably want to take some of her illness and get some sugar off her. And Stacey would probably love chocolate, and not need to get anything from her parents. Wouldn’t it be fun?"

"I'm glad," I replied, my voice falling into a whisper. "I just haven’t thought about those ideas enough."

"I wish," Kristy continued. "I hope that I’ll be able to take some of the pressure off my allergies and maybe get some sleep. Maybe I’ll get a little carried away. But I think, like my mother said, there’s going to be a time when you may not be able to concentrate."

We sat there, staring at our own schedules; at the lights on both lamp posts and windows. We talked for a while about the BSC, about school and the BSC. Then, as Kristy spoke up again, we stopped talking.

"I’d like two days off," said Mary Anne. "I’d be home before the BSC was scheduled."

"Two days off?" I asked.

"Yeah," said Kristy. "Two days off in fact."

I hung up and looked at Claud. "You’re leaving," I told her. "You guys know you’ll be away longer than I’m allowed to spare."

Claudia shook her head, turning on her computer. "Guess who," she said. "I really liked the idea of your meeting, didn’t I? And I really wanted to make it happen. I couldn’t wait to hear from you."

"How about with the BSC?" asked Stacey. "That was one of our ideas. It was something that was put together, and then the rest of us came up with a simple idea: We could meet in person every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from nine to ten, and we could brainstorm about it, and then everyone would think up our BSC ideas. We’d have to have a phone line, we’d have to have a club record book, and everyone could know their own friends and family if they wanted."

I knew Kristy knew her mom and grandmother, too. She and I had been friends all my life, even though we were very different. For one thing, Krist
