 earned her way through the BSC. That year she married Dawn’s mom, who had grown up in California. Then, when Mrs. Arnold fell in love with this California guy named Watson Brewer, they moved across town to live in his mansion. That was a big step for her, but she was crushed.

Luckily, Watson had returned to California right after his marriage ended. His mansion is still huge, and I guess it’s fun for me to share a big house with him.

Back to Stacey. It was Monday and Stacey was sitting in the director’s chair, writing in her phone book. I noticed her quick reaction and was glad to see her. Stacey’s a good listener, a good listener who listens to whatever she hears, even if it’s just when she wants to talk on the phone. Stacey also loves to read, which makes her a club member.

Stacey may be on the bottom half of our club members, but she’s not a junk food fanatic or a bad food person. She used to be, but she’d be in a whole lot worse shape than she is now. Her parents are divorced, and Stacey comes from an enormous family. To top it off, her dad’s recently divorced, and she feels she has to prove to him or her mom that she can be a successful and independent baby-sitter. (Can you imagine?). I’m glad she does it.

“Hey, guys,” she announced as the others made the announcement, the phone rang. “Hey, Baby-sitters Club,” Kristy said, “We’re going to have a meeting this Saturday afternoon at your house.”

“That sounds like fun,” said Claudia, sitting forward on the wooden floor near her bed. “But it’s not, you know, study day. You don’t want to start studying, do you?”

Stacey’s not exactly sure what it means to study, but it sure must mean to succeed in school. Not to mention to be successful in life. How would you describe your chances of gaining entrance? I’m definitely going to spend some time studying, but for the time being I’d just sit at my desk in my club notebook and try to do as much reading as I could. I’m sure it’s harder than I thought.

We were all listening carefully to Stacey talk about studying and talking about the upcoming Saturday afternoon meeting. “Okay, okay,” she muttered into the phone. “That’s all.” She hung up and looked at Mary Anne, who was sitting on the other end of Claudia’s bed.

“Who would be best for the job?” I asked.

The best — Mary Anne!<|endoftext|>
“I hope he’s not playing softball, Kristy,” Abby Stevenson said. “He probably wouldn’t be able to help you play softball.”

Kristy grinned. “Duh. But I thought we were going to stay here and take dinner.”

For a moment, Abby sighed. “We’d better.”

A knock on the door shook down the hall and Abby snatched open the lock. “Who’s free?” she asked. “How did you know?”

“Come on in, we can’t open the door without your help so we’re going to wait while Mary Anne gets home.”

“She’s already home,” Kristy corrected her.

“You’re welcome, Abby!” said Abby. Even though she hadn’t been at home that afternoon yet, the fact that the cold outside was still coming itchy feet helped convince Abby that she needed to be around the kids more.

“Come on in, we’ll be fine,” Kristy said formally, putting her foot down on the bed and pulling on her sweatshirt. “I haven’t decided who’s available right now. I’m at school today, and I’m going to pick up the phone and talk to Mary Anne and Charlie and whoever’s available.”

“I knew it was your phone,” Jessi Ramsey said.

I groaned. “I was hoping I would start the meeting first,” Jessi said, “but I guess the phone starts ringing before meetings start.”

“What?” asked Kristy.

Before anyone could
