, he was in charge of the process.

"What do I do now?" The doctor asked as he began his question. "I'm going to get a doctor from the BSC to see what you guys have planned for tomorrow. The day before tomorrow night, we have a private meeting. Today, we have to get a private meeting for our meetings. And the next day, I have to come in and ask one of my officers on duty to see me. Then I'll move to another officer. I need to meet with the BSC officer. I'll talk to him. He'll be happy to know that we're okay."

"Me too," said Watson, adjusting his glasses. "Don't ask me to help you. I'm still in charge. But I'm not going to let you see a dentist. I can't see what's going on in my neighborhood, but you know what? I think you should come into my office. And I think you should come up to my floor, too."

"Well, I'll make it," said Jessi. "I'm sure we won't need to go back if you don't want to wait on me and the club. Just sit with us and decide, okay? I won't even have much time for the meeting. It takes me about three minutes to arrange for my body to sit with me, let alone my boss. I'll just have to sit in the little office that I use, and wait."

"It would be helpful to have a private meeting," Watson added, "but it's not always necessary."

"You'd better hurry up," Jessi told her boss, who took a long drag on the bottle of rum. "It's going to take you about five minutes to reach my house." Her boss wasn't about to wait any longer. "We are going to take our leave today," he said. "It'll take you about one hour to reach our house."

"Is that what I said?" Watson asked.

"No, it's true," said Jessi, laughing. "I was just joking, and I did go in for a meeting today. I haven't been home for a long time. You guys are crazy-saddened. We don't need to sit here like the BSC does or anything, but you're right. We'll be back soon enough. I have to be ready."

"I have to be ready." Watson held the bottle down to his lips and looked around his room. "But I hope the BSC finds it in time."

"I know I said it was all planned out," Watson said after a moment. "I hope it is."

A moment later, his eyes cleared. "Are you sure it's all really going to happen?" he asked.

"It really should," Watson said. "I'll see you soon."

"We need to get you in touch on the phone," Jessi said when I got close enough to reach her.

I made my way under the carpet to Watson's room, where we'd been eating and having plenty of fun for about five minutes. Jessi's phone was at my desk, so she could ring the doorbell.

"Are you sure you're going to call our phone?" she asked.

"Very," Watson said. "And I can't wait to speak to you. You know, we're just waiting for the BSC to return from meeting. We can't wait to talk to you."

"I know I was," Watson explained. "I know I said it was all planned out."

"Do you want to hear anything from us?" I asked.

"We're always busy," Watson said. "But it's not like I'm saying we're not all going to arrive as soon as everyone else is supposed to."

"Yeah," I said. "We've got a couple of days. If things go well, we could call the BSC and get a copy of the meeting. Any time, really."

"Okay," Watson said.

Jessi, who was on the phone at my desk, answered the phone on the floor. She had just arrived at the meeting. Watson and I sat next to each other, and we shook hands. I think Watson said something like, "Sorry and thanks," and I heard a quiet chuckle.

"Thanks," I said.

It happened about ten minutes after that. Watson sat in the middle row. The phone started ringing again.

"Hi," I said, "Hi Watson. I said a quick hello to you and we're all moving to our meeting. Our number is (202) 929-6829 and we'll have to call you in a minute. And you know, that's when everyone else is supposed to be able to make appointments for jobs tomorrow. But
