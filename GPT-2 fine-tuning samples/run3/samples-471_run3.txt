 the baby and I thought we were going to be best friends forever. But somehow I couldn't bring myself to part with the money, so I called Mary Anne Spier back to tell her we would see who could get the job.

I hated being the oldest, but I thought all girls would be best friends when they were born. I have never, ever had any problems with that belief. When I was eleven, I convinced Mary Anne that I was a really pretty girl. I pictured myself holding hands with a girl from school — not the other way around, either. But it wasn't until almost a year later when I tried out for the BSC that I realized I wasn't ready to be a boy anymore. I was really glad I had taken that step.

By then, I was too old to get on the Baby-sitters Club Baby List, but I was good enough with the boys to get on before all the other club members did too. So I joined them, and by the time I met Watson (who'd just left the club) I really had the best of both worlds: a boy and a girl. I could be both.

That's probably why I'm president, and vice-president, and stuff like that. I'm super-organized, super-smart, super-tough, super-troubled. No kid ever really, ever walks away like me. I guess it's just that all I care about are my baby-sitting. That's why I'm the alternate officer, the one who can change the way our club operates.

The alternate officer job is a breeze through our meetings. I can be bossy, but my other friends — Mary Anne and me, for one — don't let that stop them from being bossy or crazy. In fact, pretty often they take things a little too seriously. So the club was pretty much over for us when Mary Anne decided she wanted an ordinary full-time job with the BSC, but Dawn Schafer took the BSC job with the BSC because of her job search. So now Dawn lives in another part of town, with other stepsiblings.

Dawn's a real sweetheart. Dawn's a really busy person and we all see her as kind of an oddity, which is interesting because Dawn was not a busy little girl. At least, not a long time ago. The BSC was one of those club days, with more club jobs than I could remember. Dawn was a perfect fit for Stoneybrook, which has a lot of kids of all ages. I mean, Stoneybrook!

Okay, time has changed so that two older members of the BSC were born in the same house — a blended couple, named Abby and Jessi Ramsey, and — well, they moved into the former residence. There's just something about their neatness that makes me sad. Abby's our president, the oldest person in our club.

Jessi's a ballerina. She doesn't do too well in school. She's not athletic, she's short, and she has to practice all the time, too. She loves playing football, but she's a good student.

Abby, who's in the band the Ramseys originally formed, moved here after David Michael died and she was very understanding and supportive of her younger brothers and sisters (she had already had a boyfriend, by the way). Like Jessi, she's smart and smart-looking, and she's pretty independent — she's a member of an organization called We ♥ Kids Club, for one thing. There's no need to advertise, though — Abby's a good student, an incredibly smart violin player. In fact, maybe she could be best friends with a lot of kids.

Now you know a bit about Jessi, since she's one of my all-time favorite members. She's so beautiful. She has long blonde hair, high-topped glasses, and a good eye for makeup. Jessi's mother died in a car accident when she was nine, and Jessi's brain wasn't developed right away. In fact, it was just too immature for a long-term brain-damaged condition called Lou Gehrig's disease. But by then, Jessi's brain was pretty much normal, and so were her hair. Plus, Jessi has a great soccer mom, and she's a member of one of the best teams in the Big Ten, the Boston University Baby-sitters Club.

Okay, enough talking. Now the club went off to a great start. We met for the first time not long after Kristy's moving. We were talking about building our first club, but then the phone rang. That's when it hit me: What if we could make a club that was simple and had a real organization? Simple enough for me. I needed an experienced treasurer, one that could count our money and do good business, and one
