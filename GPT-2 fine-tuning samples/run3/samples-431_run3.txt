ts, “Well, Stacey’s here.”

“She won’t be late.”

“It won’t be soon,” I retorted. Then I looked around the cabin. “Let me do my best, Stacey.”

“I’ll do mine,” said Stacey. “No one seems to mind seeing me in the passenger seat.”

“They didn't notice, they looked’d,' added Claudia’s mother. It seemed as if everything was going back to normal.

“All right!” said Claudia. “Let me do my best.”

“You’ll be bestestestestestestestestestestest” we both agreed. And just as I’d given everything I felt a big, steady sigh of relief fall over me. I heard the commotion in the distance and knew I had time to try before anyone else did.

Stacey watched me move across the cabin. I was dressed in my usual clothes. I was sitting in a director’s chair, in Claudia’s director’s chair, next to Claudia.

I had gone through the motions of tying beads into my hair in school. I was playing with my nails and my curly tail, looking at my watch.

When I was done, I made my mark. “It’s official time.”

“Who, Dad?” I asked myself. “Why don’t you come to my Friday meeting just in case?”

“I’m not sure,” said Mary Anne, “but I don’t think you could do it right away.”

“I’m not in the mood to make the big decision yet,” said Mary Anne. “I just wanted to say that if it’s nice to have me around all week, why don’t you come in early?”

I knew I sounded even better than Mary Anne, but I couldn’t think of any way I’d better to do it. Besides, I was busy. I had to ask the doctor for a rest. (She would be able to make me go home early if the wind hadn’t blown it away recently.) And it got me thinking — if I could do the thing early, maybe I could help my father figure out a job. I don’t know how, but then I’d love him.

I was sitting in Claudia’s director’s chair, looking at this gigantic stack of books.

“All right,” said Mary Anne. “I’ll read the BSC notebook first.”

“Just tell me why.” I nodded. “I’ve been thinking about it constantly. Not just the book, but the homework that goes into it. Who was the person who thought ‘All right,’ or ‘All right,’?’ ” (The phrase was hers to use.)

“I guess I am,” I said.

Mary Anne grinned back. “Don’t tell me you were, either. It’s just a coincidence that the handwriting is so perfect.”

“It may be,” I said.

Well.

You can always ask a doctor or something.

“I was thinking about that again,” Kristy said. “Wouldn’t that be great?”

“The notebook,” added Claudia. “Why weren’t we talking earlier about reading it?”

“I’ll read it all,” Kristy answered. “It really doesn’t interest me.”

“I haven’t been able to look through it all,” Mary Anne said.

“It hasn’t been easy getting through the whole thing,” Claudia’s voice said. “But the BSC is really fun. It’s easy to make friends and to be around girls!”

“But what does it really take to be around girls?” Claudia asked.

“All I really know is that this is what happened on Friday at a meeting of our club.”

“The meeting,” said Mary Anne. “But it wasn’t exactly a meeting. It was just the other day at her house. We had a meeting all by myself, where the only discussion was about
