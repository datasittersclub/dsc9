I would be lucky to be the person to take charge of it.<|endoftext|>
A few minutes later. The bell had rung.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club,” the meeting had said.

“Hello, I’m Claudia Kishi from the Pink Clinker!” the other club members answered.

“Hello?” I asked. My dad called first.

“Hello, it’s … Stacey …” he answered, after a pause.

“Uh … hello?” I asked.

“Hi, you guys!” I answered.

“Hi.” Stacey is Claudia’s best friend and the BSC’s vice-president. They have a lot in common, I think, but I’ll explain them later.

“ Claudia is really into clothes,” said Kristy Thomas.

“ Yeah, I agree. Fashion, too. Even Jessi and me. We’re the cutest.”

“ Do we?” asked Claudia Kishi, who was sitting on the rug.

“ For pleasure,” said Kristy.

I think Claudia sounds a lot more sophisticated than she sounds, which is a sign of her healthy big heart. She’s not a tomboy. In fact, she’s not athletic at all. Claudia wouldn’t even have a locker for Halloween.

“ Oh, but how come we put on anything besides our Halloween clothes,” Claudia said, picking up a piece of fabric. “And then we’re supposed to tie a wig and do anything else, like make fun of ourselves.”

“ So what if we did anything fun?” I asked. “You’re supposed to build a fire.”

“ No,” said Claudia calmly. “ I was going to do it.”

I didn’t have the gumption to build a fire. But Claudia was. Her house is … even if I’d put it up. I could have bigger, better things to do. And allowing me to do it would have been better.

“ Now what?” asked Dawn Schafer.

“ Living for Watson Brewer,” Claudia spoke up.

“ Living for Watson Brewer,” Claudia added.

“ Watson is a great guy. All right. Great job!”

I couldn’t believe my eyes. Watson has a wife and a kid, plus a pet hamster. His two older daughters, a hamster named Emily Michelle and a puppy named Shannon, live with Watson, who’s divorced, and also, have adopted a little girl from Vietnam.

Watson has two kids in the family. Karen, who’s fifteen (she’s eight), and Andrew, who’s fifteen. Then there’s Emily Michelle. Karen and Andrew don’t have homes right now. Emily Michelle, a hamster of the future, could be a puppy, and Emily will be a woman. We all hope she will be adopted soon. Emily Michelle grew up alone and has not been treated fairly by her friends.

I couldn’t help noticing Emily. She’s cute. Even though her family lives way across town, they don’t look a thing alike. Claudia and Stacey are the two most striking. They sound more like the two peas in a pod: extra-large, dark, thin, curly, very cute. But there they are — in my bedroom. Yumm.

Claudia is the president of the BSC, and not just because she came up with the idea for the Baby-sitters Club in the first place. It happened one day last summer, during a sitting job between Claudia Kishi and Stacey McGill. I must have said it while looking on New York City. Everyone was looking for a break — for something — so I called my friends and called them again. I was pretty excited about the Baby-sitters Club, but no one had anything for me to do with it, so I dropped the idea and went home. That’s how I end up in Claudia’s bedroom all the time — when I hear about the club I helped develop. The other girls are too. Why? I don’t know. I mean, they sure don’t have official duties. But it happened that way sometimes.

After I returned to my room, I called around to find out if anyone was interested in joining the club. Nobody did. The Baby-sitters Club is really important to me, but it
