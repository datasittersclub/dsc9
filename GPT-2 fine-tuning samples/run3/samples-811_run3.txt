 the new baby. They wanted to know, wouldn “there’s anything left over?”

“Um, no, there’s not!” I cried. As baby-sitters we take care of a lot of sitting jobs.

But Kristy’s little hands shook.

“Oh,” I said. “You’re right. You’t ever been careful,” she said. “Even though it’s summer and you can’t wear all those cute little shorts?”

Claudia shrugged again. “I’ll take it. It’s too funny, you know. But we’re all so proud of you.”

“Really,” said Kristy.

I shook my head.

“Yeah,” said Claudia again. “But I won’t admit it to anybody and I won’t pretend.”

“Well, I won’t forget,” said Kristy.

“How about you?” asked Claudia. (She must have asked too much of Kristy.) “What’s important is that everybody knows.”

After awhile, Kristy smiled. “Even though you’re so young, and you’re so shy, it’s important.”

Suddenly a little silence met this meeting. Then Claudia asked, “What’s important? Everything about our club is important,” Claudia said.

“Well,” I said. “Every member of the club was present at this meeting. It was a different day.<|endoftext|>
"Who was that?" asked Stacey McGill, speaking in her soft, very English accent. In my own voice, I could tell that she was crying.

I was in hysterics.

Stacey has a lot of respect for anyone. And she is always smiling, and always laughing so hard that there's no way she's talking at all. (She said it so well back in the '90s. She was referring to the fact that her dad had gotten married and the two of them lived in the mansion she and her mom and brother now live in.) Stacey is an incredible comedian, and she does a good job of it. Also, she goes to a school for gifted kids called Stoneybrook Day School (which is a fancy way of saying “day school”) and she really perms all the rules that apply to the rest of us. No junk food, no unnecessary teasing. She even seems to enjoy teasing, so naturally we’re all happy.

But what about Stacey’s family? Here's what I was worried about: my family. Stacey has had a lot of parents who are very supportive. For example, Dawn Schafer, Kristy’s younger sister, moved here, in part because Dawn left the BSC for a different job with a different company. Dawn had originally wanted to come back to Connecticut, but her parents’ divorce. When she and Mary Anne learned that Dawn had decided to stay in New York with her father, they were pretty devastated — but Dawn was happy living in Stoneybrook. She and Mary Anne discovered the very odd thing while they were on the move.

First things first. Stacey’s mom and dad divorced. Then her dad moved back to New York. Then Dawn and her mother were gone for several months and then Stacey discovered that, even though they had been married for almost as long as Mrs. Schafer’s been gone, they hadn’t been coming to visit all that time. So maybe they hadn’t been coming, either. They were, as far as I could tell, returning to Stoneybrook after Mrs. Schafer had left.

After that, things went from odd (that is, until one day the two of them showed up together and, guess what, they found out they each had bad habits that needed correcting) to completely normal (right up there with the vampires). Things didn’t last long for Mrs. Schafer’s been gone, but things are going to change. That’s because Mary Anne and her dad re-opened the BSC awhile ago, and since then they’ve been in the BSC, too.

(I wish I could say everything about my dad. Besides, he’s an awful lot like mine. He has this incredibly mean and immature way of looking and behaving. He can be really mean and immature, but he also has the balls to talk and be good. He gets what I mean about being mean and immature.)

Okay, enough about me. I�
