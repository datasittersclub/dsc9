======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 two years, then Kristy’s father just walked out. He went back to work. Right after he did, he met Watson Brewer. He married off Brewer’s old home (Mallory’s), moved the Thomases together, and got them to the BSC. They had some good friends (Mary Anne, Richard, and me), and members who’d moved, too. But not everyone found the time to stay in the West Wing together. One of them did, but he was Jeff. He’s an associate member. And not everyone liked him. Jeff isn’t allowed to eat at the dinner table except at meetings. In fact, he practically drives Kristy crazy.

So Kristy’s the president of the BSC, the super-organized body that’s held meetings all over town. This is the position she took when Mr. DeWitt was elected president. It wasn’t easy at first, but then Kristy’s great idea of a club — one that would be a dive-bomb for parents — came along. Now they have meetings three times a week, take phone calls on weekends, and set up club events without tying up phone lines. I’ll admit, even though it’s more like a third-partner job.

Like most super-organized bodies, the Kristy Thomas family is very organized. Kristy’s family is the most organized. At age seventeen, she was the first one on earth to apply herself to her homework. Not long ago, she met Watson Brewer, and soon after that we became stepsiblings. Mary Anne, who is eleven and a stepbrother, came home from ballet practice and cried endlessly. Watson had become Richard the Great at Keynote Night. Mary Anne had to choose between her mother and Watson, and she picked Mrs. Thomas, a good mother, who was a divorced brat and who looked forward to her new home. (Mary Anne’s dad was killed in a car accident when she was six. Watson raised Mallory by himself.)

Kristy has brown hair and brown eyes, and she’s a serious musician. Not athletic, though, since she’s had to deal with a broken leg since a lot of the time she can’t play classical music. You’d think Kristy would spend all her time practicing acting (or dancing). No, she’s not a great student. In fact, it can’t be difficult to become into either. You just have to be outspoken and opinionated at meetings to attract girls. You may even be accepted, even liked, on the basis of one study: When have you seen that guy next door? That’s the only reliable statistic I’ve ever heard. If it says so, it means that Kristy is the most outspoken person in the eighth grade. She doesn’t seem to get along with even the most casual student, but that doesn’t bother her too much. Kristy’s boyfriend, Logan Bruno, is a great guy. He’s a great baby-sitter. And Kristy’s kitten, Tigger, comes to school from time to time, over its summer stay in the city.

Two more things that make Kristy’s personality different from Mary Anne’s are age and appearance. I may be different, but I don’t have any bigoted words for that (that comes out of my mouth). The fact is, I am pretty short (except for my hair and for the long spine of my spine). But Kristy’s wardrobe reflects that. Claud’s mom used to bring us little boxes with her when we were little, and we always bought the things on the first day we evened out. Today the boxes were filled with sweaters, tights, short skirts, and shirts — rarities for Kristy’s little price tag. She says we’re too short to think of ourselves as “period pieces.” I guess being a “period piece.” fits Kristy really. Maybe the only negative part of being a “period piece is that it’s sort of a total joke.

If I do win the lottery, I’ll rent a movie with Marilyn Monroe and put them together in her room. Kristy’s neighbors might actually think of a big party or anything like that. Wedding bells might ring. We’ll get to seeing something new — a Disney movie, for example. Of course, my family and Marilyn’s will will live in my room for a while, too.

One last important member of my family is Dawn Schafer. Dawn is Mary Anne’s stepsister, and also Mary Anne’s best friend. But Mary Anne’s
