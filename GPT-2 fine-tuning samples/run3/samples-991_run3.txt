 go like, "Cool. Okay. Cool. It’s nice to have Kristy back." Actually, she was looking at me now, and she was, like, "What's the big deal?"

"I don’t know," I said. I knew she hadn’t understood. Whatever. Usually when someone says something like, "Excuse me, ladies," or "Has anybody else seen this outrageous outfit we have on already?" the expression on her face changes. It’s less funny and less full of anger. Her face is much cooler these days.

"Seriously," said Claudia, "what you want to do is go to the TV and start dressing up like a Southerner? I’ll see where you are and call right away so we don’t have to. Nice try, Claudia."

"Cool!" said Kristy. "Let’s think of something to wear that we can all wear that way!" She picked up the shirt her brother had always wore — a kind of slouchy cotton coat with a wide open front pocket — and pulled out a big belt. "Made for the Jeans Club of New York. Anybody want one? Stacey, would you?"

"What is it?" Stacey asked. She was sitting in the same sitting place she had been sitting in the morning before — the day before — when Stacey had gone away and my father and I hadn’t come back. "Who wants it?"

Kristy tugged on our sweatshirt yet again. "Stacey?" she asked, after she had stood up to introduce us to Carol, our club treasurer. "What came on?" she asked, as if we were still in the middle of a pizza party. "Any new business?"

"No need to explain," replied Mary Anne. "Business is booming here at Clubhouse.<|endoftext|>
In case you don't know, Clubhouse is the creation of Kristy Thomas.

Kristy started the BSC a few years ago, since she moved from her old house into a new one. At that time, there was a huge family: a mom, a dad, two older brothers (Sam and Charlie) and one younger sister (Karen and Emily Michelle). And Kristy and her three brothers (including Charlie who is so big, her heart is about him), plus a cat, a brother (David Michael, who is seven) and a sister (Charlotte, who is half-sister) live in the old, rambling house.

Actually, the house is pretty important to Kristy. Before Kristy moved to Watson's mansion, her stepfather, Watson Brewer, was out of the picture. He ran out on the family when Kristy's younger brother, David Michael, was a baby. But Watson and Kristy's parents have managed to send him back in time to re-establish their family.

Anyway, the Brewers adopted Emily Michelle, a Vietnamese girl of eight who is just as cute and friendly as Kristy. (Even more adorable. She and Kristy's mom have even gone on to date.) And now, just in time, our very own Karen Brewer is born! (As they say, the golden ticket to stardom.)

Oh, one more thing. Remember that time I told you about Emily Michelle? She’s so sweet and serious. Really serious. Dawn is as serious as Kristy is about her. Even though I think they do get along better when they are apart, and even though they have a lot in common, like … well, they don’t.

Anyway, that’s the BSC. The kids are fun, the club is easy, and I really do think it’s a big help to the business.

Anyway, back to Stacey and me. We were sitting at my favorite table in the whole house, Claudia was flipping through the pages of the BSC notebook. “There are seven regular members.” she began. “You will be a good member if you take the job.”

I couldn’t help smiling. Seven regular members is a lot of people. We all contribute a lot to our club. In fact, I’d nominate Kristy for Baby-sitters Club of the Year. She’s so good at these things. She’s even captain of the Krushers!

I don’t know whether I was happier when Stacey came to the BSC meeting from Alaska or sadder when Stacey returned from Alaska. Neither of them was particularly loaded. But they were each in some ways heavier than the rest of us.

Stacey is diabetic. That’s completely normal. She also has asthma and braces for nearly anything. She doesn’t like to talk about it, but
