======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 had her mom's baby-sitting business under way. That’s when Kristy and Mary Anne were a little off the rails. First they encountered Claudia Kishi, the most gorgeous dresser in the world. She had a collection of outrageous hairstyles and jewelry, but was only wearing basic baby-sitting bracelets for the first time since her parents had divorced. Then Dawn Schafer, who was just getting older and more and more outspoken, joined the club, but just for the love of all that is she missed Stacey McGill and her dad so much that she wanted to be their stepsiblings. So Kristy went with her.

Then the BSC split up. Kristy moved to California, which wasn’t easy for Mary Anne. For one thing, California is still kind of cool, as sunny and serene as Connecticut. Also, Mary Anne, as I mentioned before, was no longer Mary Anne Schafer. Her dad’s company transferred him back to California for good. So for a while Mary Anne lived in a nice little house with her mom, her younger sister, and her stepfather. Then Dawn Schafer joined along, but it really wasn’t enough. Kristy got an offer she really, really liked — and it wasn’t that hard.

Kristy, Mary Anne, and Claudia used to look really alike, and they weren’t that different anymore. Claudia had cut her hair short and carried herself with a high level of sophistication. And Kristy had mellowed a bit from late-twenty-nine to twenty-eight. Even so, her family lives in a pretty normal kind of house — but there are the occasional visits from Uncle Sam, and Mary Anne’s visits, and her dad’s job is getting her and her brothers' jobs back to New York City permanently.

So there was no easy adjustment for Mary Anne, but that afternoon she woke up feeling pretty settled in and she had a new focus (this time focused on her homework) and a new friend: a girl named Dawn Schafer. So she joined the BSC, too. And now the club meets in Claudia’s room six times a week, for all our baby-sitting needs. It makes life much easier for Dawn — and Stacey’s — since she has found another member who may be a bit more independent. Recently Dawn moved to California, and Stacey moved to New York. Dawn is a good student, and even though she missed California in the summer she found the city so much better than Connecticut. I’m really glad she moved back. It really added to her fun, which I think contributes to the sense that life in Manhattan is pretty rough. And that’s saying something. But the best places to see Dawn are Stoneybrook Middle School (where she’s the vice-president) and the private school Claudia attends.

Now that Dawn is gone, Jessi is back (as vice-president), but this time she mainly works at a jewelry store. She goes to an independent school called Stoneybrook Day School, in part because all her parents, including her younger brother, Jeff, like to keep a busy schedule. She likes being part of a responsible, healthy, happy, responsible, happy baby-sitter.

“Hi, Dawn,” I greeted Jessi.

“Hi! Hello, Dawn,” she said, as she ran toward Claudia’s room. “Are you there?”

Dawn is not an individual person. Her personality has changed. Now she’s part of a bigger family, complete with a kitten named Tigger. (She’s part cat.) Jessi also wears a different kind of clothing than the rest of us.

Kristy is also a closeted-away-from-her-mother. She has a new haircut every morning. Lately she’s been dressing pretty differently. I’ve come to think of her outfit as a sort of celebration. Sometimes she’s even looked extra cool in the outfit. We call it a kind of accessory — and I think it makes her skin crawl.

One of Jessi’s favorite outfits is a raincoat, shorts, and sandals. Our heads are strewn with old T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, and derby sweaters.

Jessi is our newest member. She comes from a blended group of people. You’ll see plenty of similarities in her in a long time. For one thing, Jessi has brown eyes and hair (she’s a pretty dresser too) and is the most absentminded of all the kids I train. We can’t really draw similarities, except that Jessi’s always on the go. We ask her to skip meals, or to take a tiny shower every
