 anything the other one did?

"She was in tears," Watson said. "No way, Mom, did she stop crying? She was just going through something very unusual. I told them, you never know what something can do to you. It just happens."

I smiled at Mom. "That's how I do things." I leaned forward, kissing Mom's ear. "And, by the way, you're very sensitive. And sensitive to something."

I nodded. "I don't ever want you to have to worry about that. I think you would be very happier if you could just get off without doing anything too outrageous."

Mom wasn't so sure about this. "My baby. Is that normal? I mean, everybody thinks it is. But I don't mean any of that. I mean that it's all normal, except that it's okay to be too sensitive."

"Anyhow, Mom, what I have is very important. Your child is a baby!" I said. "I would love him to be a boy. He might cry from the excitement of him, even if it was merely the thought that his mom gave him. I'd love to have a kid that would be his brother, too."

"Oh, you'd do that too, Mom."

"Well, as soon as you can, you can," my wife said. "Let's go in the back yard with one guy." We piled, and Mom set up her box of goodies.

"It's good for business," said Watson. "I can get a steady job. Then I can buy a house or a place to live."

I nodded. "We'll see how long they keep in touch, though. They said they'd try to find another farm in California."

"I'd love to. It'd be a great idea if you could do it and be in charge of that," Watson said.

"I'm sorry, Mom," I said, "but I think you should call a meeting so there's something to talk about."

"Thanks!" said Watson. My sister said, "but I guess I should take it up with everyone. I'll call it a meeting."

"All right," I said. It was. I went ahead to get it on the phone.

Mom was calling the meetings.

"Okay, Mom," I said, "Let's go. You know it's the first of a set of new jobs. The next job, I think, might be an exotic business. I guess you could call the California secretary."

I nodded and called the manager, David Lueck, who was still in charge of the California farm and who was in charge of the phone.

"Hi," I said, "I'm Kristy Watson. Kristy is the director of the farm business. You can call her at the phone number given by the California secretary. I think it may be the most important job in town."

Kristy smiled at me, and she picked up the phone.

"It'll be good for business," I said.

"You're right," said David Lueck. "We'll call the secretary again."

The conversation ran on the back burner and Kristy came running to me. Then she moved toward the boss.

I reached upstairs and picked up Kristy's desk, which had been filled with books.

My mom was looking at the books on a plate, and then said, "This is a job for another secretary!"

I opened up Claudia's notebook and handed it to her.

"Hello, Claudia," I said, "I'm Kristy Watson from California, and this is a new job. We're coming to California as soon as you guys return from New York City. We're interested in taking over the entire farm business — especially in California — and we need your help with a lot of things. Can I ask you about some of them?"

Claudia's smile had gone from her usual grimace into a kind of sad-faced laugh.

"All right, we do, of course," I said. "I suppose I have to tell you that if we take over the company this Monday, I won't be home. But I know our clientele has a lot to do with that. And that's when the whole idea for the farm was born. We all went in there knowing we had some good ideas. Then it was time for it to be finished."

By the time it was finished, Claudia, Sharon, Sam, Dawn, and Karen had been born. I'd asked Claudia if she thought it was a good idea to bring the baby to California, but Claudia sounded more worried.

"No," Claudia said. "This is a new job. We're going to California as soon as we get there. It
