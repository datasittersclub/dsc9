======== SAMPLE 1 ========
’s parents, Claudia, and Mary Anne’s grandparents. They bought Mal's mom and three brothers for her kids, Dawn, who’s seven, and Kristy, who’s four, at a bargain-basement price. Then they divided the money evenly among Dawn’s parents. When they got to Stoneybrook Middle School, Mal and Jessi were taking classes together and Logan Bruno, Mary Anne’s friend and a substitute teacher, was taking French. That had been tough on Logan. He was unhappy and depressed. I think Mal and Jessi wanted to be together way back when they lived in Stoneybrook. Logan is now our honorary member.

When Dawn moved to Connecticut from California, we welcomed her here with open arms. Dawn and Mary Anne had to fight hard not to fall in love and learn how to get married. Then, when they were in high school together, they discovered a secret BSC notebook that was in the astronomy section of their local library. Mary Anne was shocked and dismayed. Dawn and her parents wanted to return to their homelands, but they were too young to try to get them together.

Now that Dawn lives in Stoneybrook, we have another member who really loves her new home: Jessi. She and Mal and Jessi are best friends, probably because they share a lot of passions. They write and illustrate a lot of books, and both agree that their parents treat them like baby-sitters. The only problem is that their schedules get really busy. Jessi and Mal are both thirteen and in eighth grade, which means some of their younger years are at boarding school for real bachelors students instead of sixth-graders.

When Jessi moved to Stoneybrook from Long Island with her mom and younger brother, she was allowed to read again, and that was good. But because of her parents' practice home invasion (and strict rules about no pets in the halls, okay?) Jessi was sick again and required a swim session today and tomorrow.

Now you know the club members. There are ten of us, all thirteen and in eighth grade. We are the BSC, of course.

I am the president. I am the alternate officer. I replace anyone who has to miss a meeting. My job is to fill in for any who might be absent. The BSC has temporarily taken over the official duties of Stacey, Dawn, Jessica Ramsey, and Mallory Pike.

Mary Anne and I run the meeting in Ms. Ramsey’s direction. Dawn is our digital assistant. Jessi is our associate member, which means she comes in handy when we’re out in town for a meeting but doesn’t really have any official duties. Shannon Kilbourne (who is now temporarily assigned to Stacey’s job — as alternate officer, which she also volunteered for earlier this year) is her sister.

Jessi has thick, curly blonde hair, high cheekbones, and wears an old-fashioned way of dressing. When she got it cut, she looked good — for fun. She wants to be a children’s book author and illustrator someday.

Since we meet in her room, Jessi is the only one of us who has a private phone line in her bedroom. That makes our club meetings super-private, since her private phone calls don’t line up with her own personal sitting schedules.

Kristy makes the switch to the phone from her place in Claud’s room. She coaches Kristy and Kristy’s little brother, which is a happy accident. Kristy has the biggest mouth on the BSC.

Like most members of the BSC, Kristy is the shortest, but she’s not stuck in a chair or hung up for the phone. She has brown eyes and brown hair (still pulled to its knees from freckles to symbolize her nose) and she’s pretty (though she was in braces when she first moved here). But she isn’t perfect.

Mal's hair is light, but it’s not long. It’s a perfect length considering it’s dark (Kristy used to wear a cap with a picture of Charlotte Johanssen on it, in memory of Mal). But you wouldn’t guess she’s addicted to junk food, and, well, Claudia is a junk food addict. Fortunately, she’s learned to control her junk food intake and quit.

But Kristy isn’t perfect. She’s single, and it’s funny that she has to spend her whole life with a big, ugly family. Kristy has two little sisters, Tiffany and Maria. Their names are Dawn, who is about to be about seven. Kristy’s mother died when she was little, so their father is extremely quiet
