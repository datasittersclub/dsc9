 officer. I know my mom is still the same very sweet person. She seems to be taking care of me like crazy.

I should start it with my parents. My parents are great. Mrs. Madden has diabetes. I grew up on the health food line, but her condition was so serious that I got used to it, and had to start over. She also has some pretty serious things to do. For example, she takes all her appointments on Mondays and Wednesdays. But her mom is really strict about what she eats or even what she writes on her diary.

I admit you wouldn't expect her to be an excellent food writer. She's very thoughtful and sensitive. She takes her health problems very seriously. She always puts aside her sadness, even though she doesn't want to think up ways to deal with them. For example, recently she was very lucky to get one of the most beautiful legs ever, which she wears out at the moment. If she wore the legs again, she would go ballistic. She doesn't need a belt or anything to wear the new legs. (And she's happy about it.)

When she was in sixth grade, Mary Anne Spier discovered that her mom used to make her wear contacts, but that was hardly ever a problem. So she tried one of Mary Anne's old high-end, baby-sitting projects: one of her favorite projects was called Smartphone and Tablet. SMS is a client-only SMS service in Stoneybrook. SMS is so simple, so simple. SMS is free, really, and you always get SMS reminders. SMS does some of the thinking for SMS. Not long ago, SMS came into being with Mary Anne. She decided that she wouldn't have to pay so much money for SMS. She had already been using SMS a million times.

Mary Anne is also the treasurer of a special children's club called the Kid-Kits. The club was Mary Anne's idea. She collects the club dues, and we use their treasury for things like supplying supplies for our Kid-Kits. The record book is also a big plus, since we use the treasury to keep track of our clients.

I haven't told you much about Mary Anne, just about her friends. I didn't tell you that I'm the only BSC member who lives with Kristy, and I'll tell you who I'm the only one who has the phone open three times a day for baby-sitting.

Kristy, Claudia, Janine, Mary Anne, Stacey, Claudia, and I are the only BSC members who have a steady boyfriend or a reliable, dependable boyfriend. He's Logan Bruno, and he's cute, loud, caring, big and short, but he's the opposite of Kristy. He's a softspoken, easy-going person who is outgoing and won't let anything deter him from being my boyfriend.

Kristy is the most outgoing person we've ever known. She was the first one we had to talk about when we were forming the club, talking about our newest club member, Claudia, whom we've known since eighth grade, and the other members. One day she was sitting at her desk in the director's chair at the BSC office when Claudia said something to Kristy, “You don’t make my desk so small.”

“Well, that’s true,” said Kristy, laughing. “Claudia is very organized. She could make a very big organization like the BSC look small. What Claudia did was open up the floor plan of our club, and she showed us where to put her stuff in the treasury.”

“Awesome,” Kristy said. “The record book can never lie, right?”

“It’s amazing,” Kristy admitted.

“Well, if we can make that record book something a little more private, we can plan for events for clients soon.” Kristy also nodded and grinned.

“Great idea,” I said.”

I looked at Claudia's desk. She was doing the same thing that Kristy and I did: she was writing in her book and reading about events and jobs we could all set up with the members of the BSC.

Jessi, who is in sixth grade, wasn’t present at my meeting. She was in her usual seat, sitting next to Mary Anne, her new best friend, Dawn Schafer, and me. The club was at Claudia’s.

Jessi wasn’t wearing anything except a bra, or a top or skirt. She’d probably had a little more makeup than Kristy was offering.

I thought my voice was just being gross.

“No way,” Dawn said, trying on her top. He was
