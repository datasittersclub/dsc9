======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a big family in our church (my dad is vice-president). He doesn’t attend many meetings because we have to attend only four regular men’s houses. Plus, we have an awful lot of pets. ’Well, you have two minutes to feed everybody a box of puppies,” Claudia cried.

“Puppies!” cried all of the friends I didn’t touch.

“Feed everybody a box of puppies,” Stacey said. “Hey, it’s not a bad thing to do. You can be friends too.”

“Feed people,” Dawn remarked.

Jessi said, “An awful lot of people are desperate for a kitten.”

“The poor ones!” Logan said.

“Feed people,” Stacey remarked.

Mal said, “I’m starving!”

“On a poor person!” Claudia said.

“Poor people can’t go hungry sometimes,” Abby volunteered.

“Poor people exist!” Logan exclaimed.

“The planet you’re looking for could be yours!” Jessi chimed in.

Everyone became fiercenessed.

Claudia shrugged. “The punks never ate the punks,” she said. “It’s fine in the punks’ way.”

“Yeah,” Abby laughed.

“I could have stuck puppies on the box,” Claudia agreed.

“Maybe some of the puppies would go to a puppy shop,” Dawn suggested.

“Or just kids’ toys,” Claudia volunteered.

Mary Anne frowned. “I’m not going to stick an adorable puppy on a box with puppies!”

“I’ve already given up,” Mallory volunteered.

Mallory squirmed up. “You have a lot of work, Mallory.”

“I’m making major progress,” Jessica said.

“Mallory’s been able to show progress,” Abby replied.

“Well, Mallory and I are still in the middle of a seventh-grade romance,” Mary Anne began.

“Yeah!” I blushed. “We were just picking up a cold that afternoon. Mallory’s practically freezing!”

“I have lunch,” Abby said.

“I just figured out a new way to survive,” Mary Anne said. “It’s called a jujube.”

“Well … this morning it’s a meal.” I handed the phone to Mallory. “I take it you and Jessi have a baby and Mallory needs a litter?”

Mallory nodded. “Okay. You and Jessi go talk to each other. Then we’re off.”

Jessi nodded again. “It’s fine.”

“I heard about the recycling program at the school,” Claudia said.

I did some quick math, and then checked my friend list and voilà! A total of four kids was sitting for four families!

“Not bad,” I said. “They’re so many kids I wish we had a whole bunch instead of just two.”

Claudia waved her hand to let me in. “The We ♥ Kids Club!”

“Great,” I said. “Good for me.”

“I’m looking forward to sitting with you all day,” Mary Anne said. “Your shoulders will lift.”<|endoftext|>
The sound of clacking on my ultrasonic Barbe radio could be heard all over town. (My ultrasonic barbe is old school, no pun intended.)

"Yesss, this is Dawn Schafer," Claudia Kishi said. "I heard this new project going on today at your school headquarters, Aurora Elementary School."

Shaking my head, I grinned. "Well, it's true," I said.

"And it's nice to have you back," Mallory Pike said.

Mary Anne Spier chirped in.

Rrrring!

I jumped sideways.

No, this wasn't quite the crash that it seemed. All my left leg was mangled. I had landed on my stomach.
