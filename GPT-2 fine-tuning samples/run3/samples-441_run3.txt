 says she’d better get used to it.”

“I have to be in classes for Christmas,” Mary Anne told us, “because my parents think we’re taking them on a vacation when we’re not in school.”

“It’s okay, really,” I protested. The idea of paying my teacher’s salary was disturbing. “I just want to go home and rest. It’s kind of weird I haven’t seen my dad in weeks.”

“You know what?” Mary Anne continued, “The holidays aren’t supposed to be vacation. They were supposed to be vacation.”

“I wish they wouldn’t,” I replied. “I wish they weren’t taking me on vacation. Even if they were. It wouldn’t help me.”

“What kind of thing’s vacation? Kristy says it’s “A week off.”

As I glanced at the schedule, I realized she’d brought up a subject that had fascinated me all summer: “What would a vacation be like?”

“Sticky vacation.”

I remembered the last time I’d said it up front. It was from Stacey, who had gone to a tropical island with her father. When Stacey left, we were all sad, but it didn’t seem to bother me. Stacey’s family was more like a zoo. And while I’d been sad, I think Stacey should have been really sad.

“What if you stay back early?” I suggested.

Mary Anne shook her head. “It’s a temporary thing.”

“Yeah, but not too much.”

“I think it’s getting pretty uncomfortable,” I said. “I’ve been taking it slow.”

“But Stacey won’t be late.”

“You wouldn’t mind if we returned early?” Jessi asked.

“I wouldn’t mind,” I replied. “As long as we’re home in three or four hours. I’ll put my head in the sand, and then.<|endoftext|>
"Hello, little one?" Kristy Thomas said with a gasp. She was standing in the middle of Claudia Kishi’s bedroom.

Kristy’s great-aunt and stepfather have been getting weird looks over the years. But in Kristy’s case, it’s sometimes romantic, and sometimes it’s just plain old family feuding.

One week Kristy was in Claud’s bedroom, the next she’d be in her dresser. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays she was wearing jeans and T-shirts, and on Wednesdays she was wearing running shoes. That’s when Kristy, Mary Anne, and Dawn Schafer came to live. As they came around Kristy was amazed at how regular Kristy was (the average Kristy is not only on the regular, but bossy, too), but very different from her younger sister, Janine. (Kristy’s not overly bossy.)

"Is it true?" Kristy asked, sounding curious. "She’s the only one who gets the Christmas tree every year?"

"Yup," replied Kristy. She started laughing all the way down to the pina colada.

"Well, I heard," Kristy added with a laugh. "I know Kristy won’t get involved this year."

Claudia and Stacey were sitting cross-legged on Claud’s bed, their hair still tied up at their mouths.

"Oh, she did get involved," said Stacey McGill, who’s our club treasurer. "She thinks Kristy thinks Stacey is a spoiled brat. And no wonder they have problems."

"I heard," Kristy remarked. "Kristy doesn’t blame herself for being spoiled, mind." Claudia and Stacey are both thirteen and in eighth grade. They don’t have any pets besides their own. Still, their mother would hardly blame her for not loving Stacey’s bratty little sister a little earlier on.

"I know," Stacey told Kristy. "I've known her for years."

"So?" Kristy asked.

Stacey, her blonde hair pulled back, shrugged. "It’s just like mine. I
