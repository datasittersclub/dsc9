======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 It was the most wonderful experience of my life.

"Well, I was wondering if anybody was free for that day," I said.

Everyone shrugged.

By about two-and-a-half, the meeting had officially begun. Mrs. Papadakisto had been officially elected CEO. And I thought that was perfect because it was the first time Mrs. Papadakitos had held her own.

It turned out that after a little work at the meetings, she and I began to fall in love. And that's how we ended up together.<|endoftext|>
"That would be Stacey!" Mary Anne declared.

"Haven't you?" I said, grinning.

"I don't see anyone else who would be as lucky," Claudia remarked. "You have the most amazing talent."

"I'll be right back," I said. I was heading out the back door to my room when we heard something thudding above me. I ran to the front door and held it open as best I could.

My dad was already there.

"What the? I mean, Mary Anne!" I gasped. "What are you doing?"

"I did a math test, of course, and I've been having a great time. Besides the test, I had to ask myself the following questions: 'Are you more likely to pass the test if you don't remember this part of this?' If you don't remember this section, then maybe you won't pass the test." He was looking at me. "It would be more if you remembered it, too."

I looked up. Claudia and the others were holding hands. I was staring at the clock. Mary Anne was holding her breath.

"Y-Yeah, it's twenty-four to five this Friday," I said. That wasn't all I told my dad. By the time he finally said, "You can take the test, Mary Anne. You're in the quarterfinals."

The other BSC Members sat there staring at their phones. They all looked at me when I made that announcement, but most of them didn't want to see a big red dot.

"Wow!" Mallory Stoneybrook said. "I did this math test this week. Now you guys have been practicing your test scoring skills."

"Oh, my lord!" said Mary Anne. "I'd like to pass the test."

I looked up with a smile and said, "Pass!"

Mary Anne, who was listening with interest, gave me a kiss on the cheek and said, "That's one more test I need to pass, Jessi. Don't you like it? I'm going to pass."

Mary Anne checked her watch. She paused, then nodded and waved her hand to see who would finish the subject. Who would it be? Someone who had just finished writing in an essay? I wanted to pass the test.

"You guys are really fun," Mary Anne said. "I don't know who's more fun, or not."

"A-Awwwww," I said, turning to her so that she wouldn't hear me.

"Pass!" cried Mallory. "We'll be late. The meeting will take place right here in the room my mom needs to call me."

I grinned at her. "I already told everyone about you. Let's start our math test first."

Mallory said, "Well, you'll test that the rest of us will."

Mary Anne took her test. She sat on the bed next to me, and I drew a blank line. I didn't want myself to be overwhelmed by her test score. I wanted to give her a feeling of happiness and pride. "Thanks, Jessi," I said. I took my hand over my heart. I gave Mary Anne a kiss.

After that, the rest of us were out. In a few minutes, I would have passed.

"What about the homework?" I asked.

"You'll do it," Mary Anne said.

"Well, I'm not sure," I said.

Mary Anne nodded sagely. I took my hand back.

I took my hand free.

"The test," I began. "Have you ever looked at the writing on the wall? They're both big yellow pencil stars." I wrote in an essay that day. My eyes lit up. I felt good. The writing had been brilliant, and I'd be really psyched to write stories in the future. And I was thinking about what I'd write about in the future when I'd be free to write.

"Okay, okay, do me," Mary Anne said. "It's a lot to read, Jessi. I'm going to try to pick it up once, I guess
