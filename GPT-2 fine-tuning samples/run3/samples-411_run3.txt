, a little more complicated than that. One day while looking through Mrs. Kishi's old high school yearbook he sees a girl named Becca Schafer. She lived on the other side of town. Remember that day? It was at Mrs. Schafer's house.<|endoftext|>
As part of the BSC, Stacey is the club's treasurer. She collects dues from our associate members, who — well, they're not required to do so, since they live as far away as I’ll tell you — come to meetings. We have three of us, and two alternate members, so that means one of us earns every dollar our dues pay. (That’s how Kristy and I are able to keep track of all our cash.)

Kristy (who used to be secretary of the BSC but isn’t anymore) has been in the business for years. She used to live across the street from Claudia, which is good, since Claudia lives in a different part of town. Now she lives on the other side of town, the same neighborhood where Claudia works. They have to be separated by at least four blocks. For years, Kristy and Claudia had to work as many jobs as possible. Then, last summer, they came across a movie called The Big Short that starred David Michael and Kristen Stewart as the four main course guests. That was great, but we had to work overtime getting good seats.

As secretary, Kristy keeps our records up-to-date with the BSC. We meet from five-thirty to six times a week, in Claudia’s room. (Claudia was always the only one free, but after last fall, her parents decided to call her during that time to line her up.) She also keeps records for the money we earn. That means we’re responsible for filling out club jobs, and keeping track of our dues. Sometimes, it’s also helpful to see which BSC clients are most at ease with paying attention to our money. Here’s an example, from the official BSC notebook:

“Who’s on baby-sitting jobs?” Kristy asked us.

I’m not sure what the problem was, but I started writing in the notebook.

(By the way, there are seven members in the BSC: me, Claudia, Mary Anne Spier, and the phone number for our club’s alternate officer, Sharon Wyeth.)

“Claudia, how are you?” I asked.

“Well,” Claudia replied. “Oh, I feel so tired. I’m so tired. I just want to get home from the doctor’s appointment and I haven’t eaten for a month. So I guess I’ll just walk out of the Pikes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.”

We all groaned.

“Mary Anne, you can’t go out to eat,” Mary Anne said, “and you couldn’t go to the movies. You’ll walk straight home.”

“And you’re soooooo shy,” I added.

“You’re cute,” said Claud.

“Claud, don’t cry,” Mary Anne reminded me.

“I don’t want to ruin the party by bringing a crayon with me,” Claudia insisted.

“You would, anyway.”

“I’ve told you exactly what I plan to do, Mary,” I added. “And you know what?”

I sighed. I must be making my best friends ever. Claudia, who’s Japanese-American, is super-smooth. She doesn’t make faces. Honestly, I can tell you this. I guess I get that everyone’s best friend syndrome. Maybe it’s because I’m weird about people or that they’re different in something. Claudia’s not shy. I guess I was just shy about being her best friend right from the start.

I felt bad for Claudia’s mother when they got the divorce but’d gotten way over it. They didn’t get used to the fact that their mother, who was divorced once, now works for a company in Stamford, New York. They wanted Claudia back, but I guess I could handle that. Maybe I could live in a nice mansion with a little help from my father. The only bad part was that my mother couldn’t have babies since her grandmother died. Anyway, Claudia was so happy when Mr. and Mrs. Kishi got married. It sounded like heaven.
