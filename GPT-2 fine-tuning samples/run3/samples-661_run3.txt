 and her mother, who is divorced from Mr. McGill. Mr. McGill has been gone seven years and Emily Michelle, Mr. Thomas' new stepfather, is still living with Mrs. McGill, who left him. Emily Michelle comes from Vietnam. Her dad was killed in Vietnam. She’s a dedicated reader. In addition to Emily, Claudia has an artwork project that is going to be a work of art. It was her idea to bring her passion for art into the bureau. It would be a great project for all of us who love to read or write about children’s books.

Claudia loves health food and has a feverish appetite for health food (veggs, rice, beans, nuts, seeds … you name it). Her uncle Joe is a real health-food freak. I bet Claudia’s a lifelong health-food junk food addict like herself. She also has a great sense of humor, and always keeps an eye out for unexpected surprises.

You may be wondering why Claudia would put her junk food collection together. Maybe it’s because she loves health food and loves keeping tabs on her health: her diabetes, the way she has it, or the way she’s treated it. I think she has a lot on her plate that has yet to be decided. But I’m sure it’s enough, considering that she’s the BSC vice-president.

“Hi,” I said, greeting Claudia. At first I didn’t appreciate how nice and friendly she was. What’s more, I didn’t seem to notice that for most of the meeting Claudia was wearing one of her favorite colors: orange. She’s so beautiful, people often forget about her short haircut and her braces. She’s also so pretty, and has delicate features, too. But Claudia also has a way of dressing that no one else seems to understand.

“Hey,” I said. “What’s on your mind?” Claudia nodded. “I’m still thinking about the subway.”

I could tell that Claudia was missing something, so I called my attention to another subject. I should tell you that’s the subject of the meeting, it’s on the day after my soccer practice. That day, Abby Stevenson and Jessica Ramsey were sitting in my front yard, looking out my front door. Abby and Jessica are best friends, and their parents don’t think their parents should let their kids watch a soccer game at their own house. They also know that they should be getting a cab instead of going to the mall with their parents. That day, I had just finished eating dinner and when Jessi came in I was surprised. Jessi is an eighth-grader and the coach of a rival team. I guess she just feels that when her team’s name came up, they needed to attend the game, not just watch it.

“It’s still Sunday,” I said, “but just so everybody knows, we’re going to do a soccer practice tomorrow afternoon.” I checked my watch. “I plan on sitting.”

“Good,” Jessi said. “See you tomorrow!”

Just then the car pulled up. “Foo.” (Foo is a French for "foolishly good" — literally, from Middle English foo — literally from Old French foo.) ”

“Foo?” I said. “How would you know where I can be?”

“I haven’t decided yet, but I’m taking a morning jog tomorrow afternoon, and I am going to take my bike. I could do it on your own, I think, since I’ll be home by myself.”

Jessi did take that morning jog, but I didn’t like going out that afternoon. For one thing, I think I was tired of being in the sun for the whole day. I feel tired all the time. A little tired at night, too. Not like I’d be able to ride a scooter or go bowling.

Anyway, I decided to take some time out from my day for a while. I wanted to talk to Jessi or something. I didn’t want to ruin anything. You know what? I missed both phone calls.

So I found an alternative afternoon job. And that afternoon turned out to be very interesting. I was offered some BSC jobs, and I didn’t take them. After a while I decided that just because I was offered a new afternoon job didn’t mean I didn’t have to replace the days I’d been taking, so I
