 be, although they don’t always dress the way you would want them to. I’m not surprised that Jessi and Mal have been friends long. They are two of the most talented members of the BSC, both talented enough to take on some of the hardest jobs in the BSC. And they both sound incredibly artistic. They dress like they’re going to be artists.

Jessi couldn’t stand the idea of going through with any of her big ideas, and she and Mal both wanted to keep their original outfits. In addition, they both grew up in wealthy neighborhoods, so they want to be independent but don’t want their parents or the city (as a whole) to fix what’t seemly clothes.

Anyway, those are the similarities. The fact that Jessi’s black is what made her the first black member of the BSC is the fact that she’s the only member in the eighth grade (the rest of us are in eighth grade) of a racially mixed school. Not long ago, there weren’t enough black students in the entire eighth grade, let alone full houses. That’s why my family had to have one black member. And I’m sure there’s still plenty of black kids in our grade. That’s why Jessi, by the way, is a dancer, not a ballet student. She takes tons of lessons at a special dance school in Stamford, which is mostly white.

You see, our club used to members. Jessi and Mal, if you watched their first meeting, it was really no big deal just because we had a lot of good friends (and dues money). The girls are now best friends. The whole club — including Jessi alone — was so happy to have Jessi as our BSC president. That’s because Jessi is our California girl, our opposite number, and she really knows how to get from A to B without taking anyone’s sister to a bus, train, or airport; Jessi comes from close to tears over having her hair permed. (She’s not allergic to anything, but the perm gets the grease.)

We also have another girl. That’s Logan Bruno, Mary Anne’s boyfriend. The two of them look sort of alike — they’re both short, but they’re very different personalities. And boy, do both of them have things to do on weekends. In fact, I’m not sure we’re as "offbeat" as Jessi and Mal. Logan says things are a little weird these days because he’s on the short side and he has a lot of casual clothes, but the way I see him, he’s much more sophisticated than Jessi and Mal. Boy, is he great.

I was even in the middle of joking when I mentioned this to Daddy, but he didn’t seem to notice. He’d have something to do with the fact that Jessi and Mal were in the midst of dressing up like boys. I guess he loves boys as much as Jessi and Mal do. That’s true. But he was just as interested in the fact that Logan had overdone the dressing-up as he was in the whole thing.

When we began our meeting, Mary Anne and I thought we’d be swamped with information. But I think my friend Dawn was looking over our schedules and deducing that meeting time would be better spent dealing with Dawn’s various allergies and health problems.

It turned out that I was right — I was. Of course, I was surprised that Dawn’s asthma was so bad. But she’s pretty understanding, and Dawn is, first of all, sweet. She’s our BSC stepsister, and she can be bossy the whole time.

But there was more to Dawn’s problem than just asthma. She’s a diabetic, which means her body can’t regulate the amount of sugar in her bloodstream. Her skin, her clothes, even her hair — those things can’t cope with all that sugar. She has to change her diet and even try something like the stuff Sharon helps her toss in her snacks. She has to give herself insulin injections every day. (Although, Dawn assures me that some people take that stuff very seriously.) Plus, she has to test her blood and give herself all these artificial dosages. Can you believe that Dawn has never gotten sick?

But the BSC has its own problem. To me, Dawn’s a wreck sometimes. For starters, she can’t stand sugar (she’s allergic to wheat, sugar, and legumes — not to mention cats). And she has to deal with diabetes. (I don’t mean to make
