======== SAMPLE 1 ========
How I’d say it’s good to be home before the season started? I felt more comfortable in myself. I’m not worried about what other people are wearing. You might not hear me wearing the same pair of pants a week for weeks to come, but I could feel myself getting more and more comfortable.

Another thing I could feel comfortable wearing was the underwear of other Sea City residents. One of them was a guy named Tom Arnold, who happens to be the treasurer of the club. His name is Louie. He’s a friendly guy from the West Coast, and he has sandy-colored hair and blue eyes. He wears his hair in a casual style (with his tie down at the foot of his bed) and his clothes are simple, really. He doesn’t bring his money to all of us, but he’s pretty sure of it. If you ask him, he’ll tell you that it’s all he has left.

My club’s treasurer is Stacey McGill, one of our two junior officers. Stacey has never been in trouble before. She’s only in seventh grade, but there she was, at a special special special meeting, when our dues were changed to just our dues.

When I called Mrs. McGill back and told her the change, she was kind of happy to hear from her.

“Well, I had a dream,” she said. “That my mom and her brother had just won a big bet.”

I saw my memory flash by. She must have won it.” (I should probably tell you that this dream has happened to me.)

“So my dream was real,” she said. “I would have won.”

“I wouldn’t have gone with your mom,” I added. “We were at the game.” I didn’t think Stacey would like the thought of my dad or hers going, but I knew that she would definitely have liked it.

“The bet went the millionaire,” Mrs. McGill said. “We all spent money on umbrellas and stuff.”

We’d spent money on umbrellas and stuff for Wednesday night. At least that’s how I thought about it.

My dad wasn’t coming home tonight. He’d been thinking of me for a while now, so I told him about the dream and told him about it.

“We were so lucky,” said my dad. “Nobody was hurt in the bet, but I didn’t know who was in the bet. So it was just me and the millionaire.”

My dad, by the way, is the one I think I might have best friends with someday. Maybe next time I’ll have the problem solved. I can tell you that my dad was really jealous of me so he and I went out to dinner and frisky up until the last second.

My room should be decorated with posters of Stacey’s paintings, and with ribbons and flowers. I’ve suggested decorating my desk with colored paper or plastic-wrapped papier-mâché.

I’ll make a poster of my nails and plaster it over my pad. It’ll be a big success.

Jessi, who was sitting on the floor next to me, was a little unsteady. As far as I could tell, she had taken some nice steps before she got to our feet. She was wearing jeans, a sweater, and a T-shirt instead of her regular blouse and jacket. She looked great.

Jessi, who loves to read, especially horse stories, is just starting her sixth grade class at Newton Elementary School. As you may know, the BSC meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty until six. With eight regular members, we can cover nearly all of your day — even if it’s just for fun.

Jessi and her younger brother are something else. Jessi loves horses, and she’s as big a reader as any of us. And like any other best friends, she’s been seeing a lot of people recently. Our club has even had an honorary member, Dawn Schafer, who lives in California with her dad. (She came to the meeting to see how we were doing.)

I’m not sure if Jessi has taken care of herself much. Otherwise, she’d have looked great. But we all knew that was because Jessi’s mom died when Jessi’s father was a baby. Her mom was very strict and thought too much about boys.
