 opened him up with a cold.

“I’m sorry.” He bowed his head. “We have to fly out to Hawaii, we’ve got three days. We’ll all just have to wait.”

“Just so you know,” I said. “It’s just a game, Stacey. You’re going to pick up a little new kids fast, okay?”

My smile faded, but I knew that even I felt relieved. “Sorry, Dad,” I said. “I was just, like, throwing up. There were a bunch of new faces.”

“New kids?”

“Ah. You won’t find anybody else tripping like me.”

“Mmm.” I sniffled.

“Hey, don’t worry. Just tell us. You’ll just be a baby, Stacey, little girl. I don’t care what you do. Just tell us the whole truth. And we’ll laugh!”

My face fell. I was used to being treated like this, being watched and called. But then I remembered. “What happens when you tell the truth?” I asked.

“Well, I can’t,” Stacey told her. “I’m going to have to call Dad and ask him to come clean up. It’s not very nice. I mean, I knew he thought it was funny, but I think he’d done the right thing by telling Dad what’s really going on. He could have called Mom and asked him to call me back.”

“What if?” I cried. “What if he doesn’t say it? Dad can’t have a fair trial. Mom could be dead broke if she thought that Dad couldn’t call her back.”

“Mom can,” said Stacey, “but I’m used to it. I don’t see how he could tell Mom I’d done the right thing. Not when I’ve known him like this all my life. Mom is our only child, remember? We both love kids but she’s used to it. He’s used to this. He asked me to come with him on the road trip, so he could see it for what I was — a vacation. He’d wanted to know how I felt. And I gave him the truth. I was just as dead broke as Stacey. I think I could kiss her tomorrow night at the end of the month. But for now, I’m going to wait.”

I snorted.

“Cough’st ringing,” said Mary Anne.

Stacey picked up her dictionary. “Ew. Exclamation. ”She should have known she’d be the one pronouncing it in French.

“Whaaaat?” I said.

“You okay, Stace?”

“Well, I’m just fine.”

When I got to my feet, I heard a familiar rattling sound. And what I’d heard was … a girl.

Who? Who was that? I checked my desk. It was empty. “Hi, Stace!” I said, waving my arms. “Can I get out of here?”

“Sure,” Stacey replied, looking confused. “Sorry. I was just checking and returning your papers.” She crossed her fingers and the room opened up more completely for me. I realized that no one else was in the room. I had to look in my own bedroom. It’s huge, big enough for four people.

“Hi there,” said Kristy. “Come here, take a look at my paintings. I’d have to go to the mirror.”

“Who painted my paintings?” I asked.

Kristy gave me a look that I’d never seen her give a rat’s nest. “Jackie Rodowsky,” she said. “He used to have a dolphin’s nest in the garage. Tom’s terrier.”

“Who’s Tom?” I asked. I was looking for this little guy in my bedroom. Tom is the one who puts together the best baby-sitting shows. Every week he’s there coaching my softball team. During the week we
