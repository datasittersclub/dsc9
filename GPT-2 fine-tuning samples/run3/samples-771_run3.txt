======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 moved in and out of the club quite a lot. Not only did she grow up in a small town, she already belongs to a different baby-sitting service, but she’s a member of several local clubs and has even had her own radio show.

It was all very confusing at first for Dawn because she has some new experiences that she needs to master, but not too much so now that her parents are divorced and her three brothers (our newest baby, Jamie, is seven months old) live with her brothers and brother’s mom. And she still has a long way to go. But now she seems pretty happy and healthy.

We decided to hold our meetings at Claudia’s because she lives so far away now and our schedules often shifted because of her extra time. Also because Claudia is the only BSC member who has her own phone with a private number (in fact, it’s part of the BSC record book), so clients could check the record book to see who was available.

Claudia makes a terrific treasurer because she is such a good fitter and has better math skills than most of us eighth-graders. She was on hand for Friday, when Kristy and Mary Anne and I found out the hard way that we were going to be baby-sitting for both men and women. Claudia collected our dues and gave us her pass to each meeting. If any money is left over (because we pay club expenses), we throw it at something fun such as art lessons and pizza parties. We put it in our pockets and draw next Monday behind our desks.

We don’t have many regular jobs, especially not at this small club where we hardly have a full head of budget. That was the problem. Our clients would think that, after passing around the dollar amounts on the dollar sheets, we were sitting across from them with paper or pencils, we were just doing our jobs with the money we earned.

But then the penny began to drop.

We became convinced that the problem was too much money for any sort of regular sitter. The club needed someone who could take on more than two jobs, which was right. Claudia joined.

So she was replaced. That’s how things were at the club meeting that day. I had not expected to see such a dramatic change, someone so organized. Now that Dawn Schafer had returned to the BSC, everyone was happy and strong.

But Claudia started dressing differently than the rest of us, and while we’re here as baby-sitters, Dawn is still wearing pigtails, glasses, and braces. She does look sophisticated, though, and I think she’s had time to mature a bit (and is wearing these nice, practical leotards that her glasses don’t really do much about the way the rest of us are).

However, that’s okay. I’ll tell you more about Dawn as soon as I get the car.

Claudia moved to the neighborhood Mall of Ushers. She has three sisters: Mal, her mom, and her younger sister, Janine. Her dad walked out on their family when David Michael (David Michael’s kitten) was just a baby. Her mom got a job with a company in Stamford. Her father barely had a day off. He just met and sort of fell in love. Then he fell in love again with Mallory’s sweet, old boyfriend, Robert Brewster. Then he married her. Mallory and Robert moved into Dawn’s house on the other side of town, which was swamped with families now.

Actually, all the kids live on a different side of town than the rest of us (Mary Anne has two younger brothers and one younger one). But Mal and Claud are very close. They have seven-year-old Jack Sprat and eight-year-old Karen. In fact, Dawn had mentioned that they had some kids in high-school, but Mal and Claud had kept quiet about them in the past. Finally, in the spring of last year, the Schafer-Berkers, Mr. Schafer, Dawn Schafer, and I were all invited to our first baby-sitting job in awhile.

We got our first call from the club one night when a group of kids in their neighborhood had made a party. Everyone was talking about Halloween. We were thirteen and in the sixth grade at that time, and we were calling about six or seven times a week. Dad would come home from the weekend and we’d have to wait until the next afternoon before we made up for him and his mother.

So Dad called us back to tell the rest of us about the party. And right away, we started receiving phone calls and comments about our new job. (Some people were really, really unhappy about not getting a Halloween costume for ourselves.)
