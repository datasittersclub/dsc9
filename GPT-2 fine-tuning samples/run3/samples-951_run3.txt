. It was hard not to giggle. “Oh, I know.”

“And you know what and whatnot,” Mary Anne continued, “but first let me tell you all about the game.”

It was Friday afternoon at practice, and it was my first time playing softball. (I'm the youngest team captain, and I must have been eight, since the coach was wearing babyish-looking baseball cap with these bold designs — like velvety around the waist, like a velvety around the ear — and then big, huge hoopling around the ankles.) We played all afternoon long, but at last I managed to make it to my own locker, the bleacher, just in time. My teammates followed me around, opening my door when I showed up home.

I tried to hide my excitement (which was that I was going to be a free agent after the season) but it just wasn’t there. I mapped out a schedule for New York when I got home. See, I had just come home from a baby-sitting meeting with my parents. It turned out that my mother’s phone number was already busy with calls from parents who needed baby-sitters. So I took down my schedule and called my mother.

“Hi, Mrs. Arnold,” I said when she answered. “Friday afternoon? … Yeah, they’re out at the Pikes. We’d better start at five-thirty.”

Mary Anne turned to look at me in confusion. “Don’t you have afternoon business?”

“Yes, boss … yes … I have afternoon business.”

“Bye, everybody!” I yelled.

“Anyway, it’s going to be five-thirty.”

Mary Anne was speechless. “What on earth is going on?” she asked.

“I’ve got afternoon business,” I answered confidently. “Okay, get back to the Pink Cliffs. My ship has wheels and piers covered.”

Stacey had followed Mary Anne into my room. Just then Dawn emerged from under my bed.

Surprised, I took my watch off my shoulders and said, “Guess what. It’s not five-thirty and I’ve got our second practice run of the day.”

“That’s okay, Kristy,” said Stacey.

“Tomorrow night’s our night to get ready for our Day of the Test,” Claudia reported. “Everyone has their own time now. As it is, all our baby-sitting jobs are conducted in my private office.”

“Oh, right,” said Stacey. “I’m sorry I’d do it, but all I can think about is the Baby-sitters Club.”

“All you have to do is take baby-sitting jobs that we’ve scheduled for you,” Kristy added. “Bye-!”

“This is so unfair,” interrupted Kristy.

“No one is trying to make us lose our jobs and theirs is just stupid,” said Dawn.

“Everybody knows the BSC,” said Jessi.

“The idea is …” began Mary Anne, “to have a real discussion about what should be in our club notebook.

“Yes?” said I.

“Oh, I see. So what’s the plan, then?” said Kristy.

“I’ll write it down in the notebook,” I said.

“How about …” suggested Mary Anne.

“Okay, okay,” said Kristy. “Then we’ll write about our trip in that notebook.”

“Really?” exclaimed Jessi.

“How about if we’re all in Claudia’s bedroom and you all are downstairs?”

“How about if we’re all upstairs,” added Kristy.

It was a simple idea, but it worked. We won more baby-sitting jobs than anyone could have hoped for.

“Kristy, you are the one who was in charge,” said Mal, “unless you want to give me a hard time about this.”

“Kristy?” said Stacey. “What’s the big deal, you want to change the way we work
