 time on that line would've made me feel so awful. She didn't want to have to go through something like that, especially when I was on probation.

"What are you doing?" I asked.

Kristy smiled.

"I'm not having any fun." She answered.

"I suppose," I said.

"And as you might guess, I have to be more careful of myself," she said.

I shrugged.

"Maybe I'm having fun too!" I said.

"Maybe you should try to get a job at a bowling alley instead of the bar you go to," she said.

I went to my mom. I looked around my room to see who was going to be downstairs.

"Hey Kristy, don't be surprised if I do end up being the girl I was with. I'd be glad to work at one of those great clubs that's more club meetings than anything else!" she said in her little voice.

Before Kristy had any inkling that I was feeling awful, I thought, Maybe I shouldn't go to that bar and sit at the other side of the aisle, which was the nearest one in the house.

Kristy was sitting in the back of the bar. The nearest one is the nearest one in the mansion. Kristy and I have a lot to talk about. (Kristy is the newest of a family of thirteen kids. They live in an older house, which is bigger.) She's been married to a man she met when she was a little girl, and they have lots of siblings. Plus, her older brother, Philip, is president of the United States Olympic Club. I mean, who doesn't love a football team? And Kristy has kids. And Kristy has pets. And her little brother, Andrew, is the president of the Ringling Bros. — a family called the Ringlingans.

Kristy's parents (two brothers and two sisters, and her twin brother, Charlie) live in a mansion on Long Island. Their house is a little over a mile from the house where Kristy and I lived in the first place. Kristy is tall, but she has brown hair, glasses, a big nose, and dark circles. I think Kristy might be shorter than Kristy — maybe her twin brother is too, and maybe her hair is not long enough for her eyes to line the way the rest of me is. She looks much older than Kristy, though — she looked nearly identical to me in black and white. She wears jeans, a T-shirt, and a sweatshirt, a sweater, and a black top, which she shares with a white blouse and sweater.

Kristy's hair, which she puts to braided, long blonde, is short and curled, and it's almost like it's raining. It doesn't matter what the weather, if anything or not. She just does everything right. Her hair, in turn, has black, curly, curly-haired, brownish-brown hair. Kristy's eyes are dark, and she also has dark brownish brown eyes with pale skin. (Her skin looks a lot like mine.) Kristy comes from an older family. She's our first baby-sitter. She's her mom's best friend. Kristy used to call Kristy, like, "Hey Mom!" when she was younger.

Kristy's room is decorated with stickers she likes. She also has the only phone she can use, and she has to call in advance to reach anyone. They all know whom she is, and when they call they give Kristy a number. On top of that, they advertise Kristy's allergies. They tell Kristy that she should eat something free of wheat, that her allergies shouldn't be the way she eats, and that Kristy should give herself food to cope. Kristy wants to be a health food addict. She's not, but she's going to try everything she can to be a health food addict.

The only time Kristy gets sick is during bedtime. Once, when she was having a little nap, she was just thinking of her favorite movie. Suddenly, she remembered how awful it is to be sick. She turned to me and said, "You better go. You're going to be fine. You're being very careful."

I grinned. "If I'd known that, I wouldn't have called you. We're still sitting in the living room, and there's one thing Kristy said. She said, 'Do you know what's best for you and me, and what's good for pets and your kid?' She said: 'What else could you say?' That's when Kristy said, 'I think I know. You're the nicest girl in my world. And I love you enough to do something for you. But I'd like to tell you what I think
