 being a BSC member. But she also comes from a small family.

The club she grew up in is bigger than any other in the whole state of Connecticut. We're in a great club. We even have a president, Mary Anne Spier, who is from Long Island and her mother, who is from Vietnam, visits so often that they can be very, very close.

In fact, Mary Anne and her grandmother, Nannie, moved into our farmhouse just three miles away when the Spiers were transferred to another family. That house was a very small one as far as Mary Anne and her mother were concerned. Then they discovered that Mrs. Spier was raising a huge family that included the two older ones: a twin; a baby brother named Charlie (his real name is John David Ramsey, Jr., but Mrs. Ramsey calls him John; his real name is David Michael; and a grandmother named Karen). She even adopted a puppy.

The best part about having a whole family running around the house is that none of us lives in a mansion. This is true of most of the BSC's activities. For example, our meeting at the house was a mess. As I mentioned, Mrs. Ramsey never does her own laundry. She also puts the house up for use. Even though they have a great looking farmhouse, it wasn't particularly warm. The heat made the house seem practically a torture chamber for our two pets. Sometimes the heat can kill.

Mary Anne also has a brother, Charlie, who's a professional ballerina who has a steady boyfriend. I suppose Mr. Spier wouldn't mind.

All of us have a soft spot for Mary Anne. She's a good person and a good mom to come here with us. She has a good quality of life, but she still has to deal with the constant problems of the family. For example, Dawn lives with the Spiers, Mary Anne and her sister, Anna, but it's not always easy. And because her parents are divorced, Dawn's brother Jeff is not allowed to visit her.

Dawn has a younger brother named Peter (actually he's eight) but they live in her old house, meaning they don’t have any pets. They also don’t have any pets besides puppies and kittens (not far from the twins).

Mary Anne is constantly coming up with new ideas and new ways to hold things together. For instance, she’d like owning a zoo (maybe even a health zoo) in which there is plenty of room. As long as Jeff is around, she could make her dream a reality.

In terms of personality, everyone has trouble keeping each other happy. I don’t know anyone who can do that.

It was also a problem for Mary Anne not long ago when Mary Anne’s father, Bart Taylor, fell down a pretty difficult passage. Mary Anne’s parents had separated. Mrs. Taylor didn’t want someone to hold her with her younger brother (actually, they only talked about it on the phone because they were divorced). After Mrs. Taylor realized that her father could still be incredibly protective, even if he had a steady boyfriend, Mrs. Taylor decided to change her mind and let Mary Anne move in. (That’s how Mary Anne became so close to Mr. Taylor.) Then Mary Anne discovered that Mr. Taylor had dated a guy named Jeff Brewer and they dated on the phone several times, even though they were pretty similar.

At that point, Mary Anne really came into her own. She had started out by wearing a button-down shirt and jeans and running a little more in style. But her style continued to change. She became a more sophisticated dresser and more elegant fashion model, and she gained so much popularity that she finally made the move to Stoneybrook.

That’s where Mary Anne comes in. As president, she doesn’t let any of the usual things get in the way of the good things, including her involvement with the Barretts.

She also coaches a softball team for little kids. (Our first softball game, a game she and Anna played in when her younger brother and sister were in the big league.)

And as I said, Mary Anne is a BSC member.

So that’s Mary Anne and her brother Pete. But they weren’t all bad things. As I mentioned, Mary Anne and her father are both very strict, very proud and very loyal. She even has to watch what she eats. Mary Anne loves sports. She likes to read, especially horse stories. As hard as she is on her clothes and habits, there’s nothing wrong with it. Mary Anne loves art. She’s always in the process of coloring and sculpting and drawing characters, or putting up posters or something. And she tries to make herself available for schoolwork.
