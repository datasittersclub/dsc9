======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 sit on my bed (and my room), to give me a good looking look. (Of course I'm not wearing black. I really like it.) I do wear my vest occasionally during visits to the doctor, which I usually wear on Mondays (but not in the evenings since my clients ask me why I wear my vest). And I have a bunch of other things in my life, but those are my main activities.

Before I get into this, I should explain that today was my best day of the week. The job was one that was not easy, and I was nervous. I had to deal with the fact that one of my jobs is a very special one. It's something that, in a certain way, I am part of the family. (It must be very special, in that my parents are very good at it, even though they disapprove of it.) And, as I mentioned, I have two younger brothers. That was kind of weird, considering that I have the same mom and dad. And they are older than me, too. (Mum, I know I sound like a bit of a cork.)

So, when I got the news that Logan Thomas, who is the BSC's alternate officer, had passed away, I wasn't the only one looking forward to Friday, April 17. But I was the one concerned with Logan's health. I asked my brother Charlie to attend the funeral, and Logan, who had just been transferred back to California two weeks ago, came on to tell me about Logan.

"I'll call you tomorrow, Mr. Porter," I announced, saying farewell to my friends. "We call you in here tomorrow afternoon and call you back in five minutes."

"Uh…. Bye," Charlie said.

I didn't have to tell him about Logan. Charlie and I are friends, and he has a little sister named Janine (who also has a younger sister). Logan is a baby-sitter, and we do our best to listen to him. (She takes the steps very well, though.)

"But he was good to Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thomas!" my brother Bart said. "All right. But he died one fateful afternoon. Mr. Thomas was a good friend of ours who was a good friend of mine."

"Maybe I should write Logan's parents up," I said.

"Uh-huh," Charlie said. "No, no, Mr. Thomas will write Mr. Thomas. He needs to know."

"But it won't take much, will it?" I asked.

"No, I'll see what Mr. Thomas can do about it," my friend Bart replied.

"Oh. Well, he died this morning, so he didn't take a nap afterward," I said. "No, he's in too deep for a nap."

"And Mr. Thomas said he would call the doctors, too," Claud pointed out. "He died today after a little nap."

"And it's because he died in the heat of the moment," I added, as if I were being kind of ironic.

"That was a good time," Claud replied. "But it was the worst time I had ever been in California. Mr. Thomas had just been transferred to this hospital to give himself some rest."

"That's right," I said. "Maybe he still has some time."

"But Mr. Thomas would want to go to New York," Claud replied. "He just can't go there. I think he's already thinking about what to do."

"What about California?" I asked.

"That's a serious situation in California," Claud added. "I wonder if he can leave to go to a school like Stoneybrook. Can you tell him where those places are?"

"Maybe we could go to someplace in Manhattan. If he's all right, we can go to Stoneybrook."

"I think he is, Mr. Thomas," I added. "So he does. But I think he's still trying to think through what to do with Mr. Thomas, either — leave New York to go to Manhattan, or go to another doctor and see Dr. Thomas."

"Oh, please," I said. "I thought you didn't know me. I meant, you'd be glad to know — to know — that Mr. Thomas was going to the hospital because he'd probably come back to Manhattan and visit. If I didn't know him better, he'd be there and he'd be here and he'd be right back. That's all very important in Mr. Thomas's case, anyway."

"All that information is a shock," Claud said. "We're not sure if he'll get the attention that we need that day. It goes away if he visits a mental health crisis center, though."

"I know
