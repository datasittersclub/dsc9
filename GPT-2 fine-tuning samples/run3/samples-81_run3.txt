======== SAMPLE 1 ========


I started my own company, in which I had to help drive sales and buy new stuff every week. I'm glad I did. I've even been writing stories about books about the jobs I've found. I write about books with a special flair.

I don't know what happens next. My company will go away, and people will call me and tell me they're interested in a book. That might be okay or it might be not. That's a lot to ask one person at the same time! But I hope it's not to keep us at a distance. If it's too difficult for us to stay at war for too long, it won't be to keep things at a brisk two-week long. We'll never really be at war. But that's okay. And we're already having a pretty good laugh about it.

We're in a lot of trouble — we live on Stoneybrook Avenue, which has long been our main street with all the good shops. We also live in an extremely crowded city (which makes it hard for us to have phone service), so we need somebody to call for help, not just sitters. So, in order to help out, we'll have to meet five times a week. We'd like someone for this job. If we have enough money, we can buy a limo, a bus, or whatever else we need. If no one is around, we can call someone at the door and make a call. We probably have more clients than we can count on. Then, I'll put this in writing: We have plenty of clients. They're very nice, because they meet up with each other at the end of the summer and often we have one of each of our clients.

I call this "The Kids Don't Dance." We've been doing this for years. Kid-daddy stories have always made us happy, just like their stories of their parents.

The thing about Kid-daddy stories is that they don't bother us much either. There were, in fact, at least five stories in the family history book, in Kid-s Club meetings, in Stoneybrook History Center, and in our children's soccer team meetings. I called them Kid-daddy stories and asked them whether they'd ever met a Baby-sitters Club member. The answer, they told me, was no.

One of the stories was a Stoneybrook, New York, neighborhood story. It began with a Stoneybrook, New York, boy coming to school on a rainy day. His mother, Mrs. Mal, wanted to help raise him by herself. The Stoneybrook parents decided to move the boy to a private school. Mrs. Mal would go on to take care of his other best friend and the club treasurer (who has a lot of good clients.) Then, at age six, they came across a baby-sitter named Kristy and their family moved to Stoneybrook with her. So Mary Mary came over to help out, and Kristy started to get along better than ever before. Mrs. Mal's new school was in Schafer Center at Stoneybrook. The Stoneybrook family moved in! And soon, Kristy's parents were convinced they had a good thing going for their little guy. And soon, Stoneybrookans did!

I like to think of Kristy like that of me. She has lots of interesting life stories, though. I like being a baby-sitters club member — and I appreciate having them in my life — so I guess I have to love the Baby-sitters Club.

Kristy has a funny, unique way with kids. She likes to think of herself as the firstborn in her family and has a knack for being punctual. She seems to be taking the ball at everything. We should probably talk about this a bit more. When she got up from her bed, she and Dawn were about to have to go for their own run at the stairs. Dawn had her arms crossed and her knees crossed. Kristy thought, Why would she need that kind of support in a world where everyone is expected to be the keeper of their own house? I love Kristy and I admire her way of speaking, which is a touch insensitive for a kid of that age. (That's my main thing about Kristy!)

I have a certain affinity for her. I adore that motherly goodness that is the Mom-Boy Club, and I adore that baby-sitter's way of dressing. And it's not because she's such an easy target for a teasing, attention-seeking baby-sitter.

Kristy is also a soft-spoken person with an edge about her. Her boyfriend of seven years, Jeff, a sports fanatic, is Kristy's love. Jeff is a math whiz and also the oldest of five children. Kristy's the first one to have a baby.
