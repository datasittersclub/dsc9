======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I think some of you guys knew that the kids were going out to New York, so we took them there. (We always do, huh?) We ended up going out with them. It was great. We spent a long weekend there. In New York, if you think about it, we have another club of our, um, own called the Baby-sitters Club....

The BSC is a kind of unofficial baby-sitting club. They don't come to meetings, but we keep regular meetings. Kristy is not one of them, but she is definitely the Queen of the Bloke. She has to have some kind of organized scheduling problem, as if having a club organized in advance by one sitting baby-sitter is any different from having a health club. She's great, though. She keeps our meetings organized and well in control of herself. She also has a secret pass for all our junk food. (I just can't seem to find anything to like about it.) Plus, she invented the Snack-Kits. They seem so small, and look neat, but we hardly ever eat them. Besides, we complain that she stashes them, since they are stashed everywhere. That's not surprising, given that she and I have been best friends all this time, despite the fact that the Junk Food is everywhere.

Besides being BSC secretary and co-organizer, Kristy is also our treasurer, and while I love the fun part of it, I also love to mooch up funds. Stoneybrook is rich, and wealthy is good as well. So my personal budget in Stoneybrook is pretty low. But when my parents got divorced, I ended up splurging on the whole house. I had to splurge way more than I paid back then, but I was pretty happy.

Anyway, back to my regular clients. Mary Anne and Charlie are the two best friends I have right now. They are so close. I can only imagine what a day's work might be like, and how they'd feel if they saw their parents go. But nothing like the experience to tell them that they have to replace me at the table.

Mary Anne and Charlie are very different. They both love the outdoors and especially horseback riding. But they also feel that their families are a bigger part of their being than other kids do. Mary Anne is quiet and shy and does not wear too many clothes (she used to be blonde and pretty), and she always has one pair of jeans over her regular clothes. She has no brothers to whom she belongs. She seems older than the rest of us, which is why she is the alternate officer.

So, that's the regular members of the BSC. The junior members are Shannon Kilbourne, Abby Stevenson, and Mallory Pike. Jessi Ramsey would probably be a Kwanzaa. We might, as a club would, call it “little things.” Mal has long, curly blonde hair, which is bunched up like a Kwanzaa, and big blue eyes, so she would look terrific on a daytime TV special. Jessi’s is almost white, and she is from a big family. Her mother runs a meat processing plant here in Stoneybrook, so Mal has to deal with that. Mallory has a big personality and is outspoken and opinionated. She can be very bossy, even at school. If something was a problem for her, she could manage to squeak it out without letting it feel like she was doing all wrong. Jessi, on the other hand, is an only child — she was only born there. She grew up here.

The main thing Mal has going for her is her baby brother, Andrew (well, he’s a boy, I guess, but I like his personality too). That day, when she had returned to the club, she was holding onto one of Jessica’s shoelaces to gab her toe toe back to the ground. Mal, on the other hand, was about to gab her toe to the sidewalk when she remembered that she had a stroke! (So do most of us.)

“Hi!” she said, peering over her shoulder. “Did you just ask me to?”

“Uh, yeah. Was I supposed to ask you to go to the orthodontist,” Mary Anne replied. “I was hoping you could talk in-between appointments.” Just then, she heard a terrific tune. “I’m going to be amazed.”

Mary Anne grabbed her shoelace from her desk and began pacing around the room, her toe curling around the sidewalk.

“Dawn,” Mallory said. “It’s going to be amazing!” Mary Anne was not expecting this. “She can take
