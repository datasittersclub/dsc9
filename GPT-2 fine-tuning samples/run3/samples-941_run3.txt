 from the mansion and the BSC itself, a great idea. We call the club meeting on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons from five-thirty until six. The club meets the week after your wedding unless it’s a temporary arrangement, in which you’re at home with your children.

I have a feeling that most of us have. But when you’re in the BSC, the quality of your baby-sitting is the clear front-page story. That’s because the California club is known as the Baby-sitter’s Heart. And if you thought holding your kids in your lap was just some kid-club thing, think again. The California club has more than just a big budget: The California club has more than enough regular clients, and one good sitter is David Michael, the great guy.

Okay, enough about me. I’m the club treasurer, and you already know me well. I came in second place in the BSC when my mom bought the Mal's cat, and I still sit at the mansion, where everyone has their own bedroom. We started out with ten people, changed to eleven last year, and we’ve been getting more and more work. (I’m about to say so.) We got a ton of jobs, thanks to my big family.

For every official BSC job we take on any family, there’s a Kristy Thomas job. That’s because Kristy is one of the greatest sitters on earth. She’s responsible for paying dues (which we use for club expenses) and giving our money to help Claudia, our vice-president.

For every official BSC job we take on any family, there’s a Kristy Thomas job. That’s because Kristy is heartened to death that the club meets in her room.

Kristy, for example, is the one with the bad news. She can’t spell for chocolate or milk or cheese. (She makes her own dyes.) Also, she’s terrible in math. If you’re in her room, I guarantee you there is a hundred ways to make one number that doesn’t do one thing. You can throw together complicated designs, for example. But if you really think about it — and you should — if you threw together this great assortment of markers and stickers, you’d find several hundred entries that didn’t go exactly what Kristy had planned. No wonder our meetings usually turn into mass-fries. What’s so great about Kristy? Nothing. It’s awful.

And as you know, Dawn is back in California, and Stacey is out, too. Jessi has a baby brother, brother, and sister, which is crazy, but it also means her parents can support her, even if it means skipping a few crucial meetings. They’re best friends and they’re stepsisters. Jessi moved back to Stoneybrook from her native NY to join the BSC, and to help take care of the Thomas kids. Then, when she was in New York, she and Mallory were involved in something entirely different. They were involved in something worse — a car accident. Luckily, nobody was injured, and the children’ families quickly became homesick.

So — that’s Kristy. But we all started out at the same house, and now it’s the same family. That’s how we all fit into the BSC. Kristy is casual about her appearance. She wears what we call her uniform: jeans, a T-shirt or turtleneck, and running shoes. (Now, she’s the president of the Baby-sitters Club. It’s hard to believe she doesn’t come to meetings.) She has an unusual fashion sense, too, although not surprising. You’d never guess her clothes were made in Stoneybrook. She has shorts, a short skirt, and little-kid-friendly clothes. But these days, she looks more like a fashion model.

Mary Anne Spier is the BSC secretary, which is the perfect job because she’s also Kristy’s best friend. After Kristy, they’re going to be in a new neighborhood soon, but before that they’re very different. For one thing, Mary Anne is pretty ... and even though she’s white and her hair is short, her appearance is very serious. Her parents always disapprove of her appearance because she looks like she was born with a giant hole in her forehead, which was pierced just by thinking about it. She has to wear as little as possible of the conservative sort of jewelry, and she has to make sure she looks good in the outfits she creates for herself.
