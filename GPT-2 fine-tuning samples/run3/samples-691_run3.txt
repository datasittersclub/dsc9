�” I said. “Oh. Great, that’s right. We’ll finish it and we’ll report to my office one by one after dinner, okay?”

“Yes.” The phone rang. Kristy said we’d call one number and then hung up. “This caller is from Charlotte, North Carolina. They say they need an art lesson.”

“Nope.” The person on the other end had provided the art lesson. Kristy hung up. “Thomason’s Shannon, see? They gave her the art lesson.”

“I’m making art.” Kristy told me to stop. “That reminds me. I’ll look into it.”

“I’ll see you then.” Shannon called back just as the meeting was ending. She had just finished making art lessons when I hung up.

After the meeting I got a call around five-fifty. I was inside the Kormann Club meeting, waiting for my friends to come up with ideas for improving the Kormann Test. Kristy called me a rat, and Logan and Shannon were calling my boyfriend.

It was just before five-fifteen and I’d already thinking of the idea and being creative. I was listening to a radio program on my own, thinking up some imaginative way to test someone else’s word processing skills.

I looked around the room. I was amazed at how creative my friends were. But I hoped that by studying the idea and testing it out in real life, they’d come up with some other good one as well.

“Let me know at noon Wednesdays,” announced Logan.

I did start to plan a few things about test day, though, when the phone started ringing. It wasn’t until six o’clock that the call stopped.

“That person is new York City,” announced Shannon. “She needs someone to sit for Dr. Johanssen, and she needs someone to take care of her son David Michael.”

“Yosh, I think this might be an interesting test.” I said, looking around the room. “Would you mind helping out?”

“Sure,” volunteered Mary Anne, who was listening attentively to the caller. “Just call me if I have a problem.”

“Great,” suggested Logan.

Kristy turned to me and said, “I’ll call them right now. All right.”

As soon as I mentioned this I wanted to move on to Kristy’s other business. “Business is business,” I said. “Speaking of test days, I’ll start it up!”

With a smile, Kristy jumped into the phone receiver drawer and took out a sheet of paper. “This is Dr. Johanssen. He needs someone to sit for David Michael, Kristy’s little brother. Would you be willing to sit for him?”

“Sure, I’ll test him out on Wednesday,” I said.

Claudia and Mallory lined up the money. Everyone else followed suit. The appointment day was on.

My other big idea was test drive. As the phone rang, I had a brainstorm.

“The public could call this number three times a day, from five-thirty till six o’clock, so as to reach a zillion phone customers in a matter of hours — that’s the idea. The more people we have available to the test drive, the more chances we have of reaching a lot of people. It’s simple: if a person has a certain interest, we can reach her, just like if we had a certain passion. So we put together tests to see who can make a certain number of available calls, and we each collect the money — just for you.”

The kids in my front yard were excited. It was their day, after all. They’d been waiting forever for their brothers and sisters to show. They’d been waiting since the beginning of seventh grade.

“Come on, boys, you have a test drive, you kids!” I said.

“Yay!” shouted Karen and Andrew.

“The test drive will run from five-thirty till six o’clock on Wednesday, and it’s going to take almost an hour!”

Claudia and Mallory stared at each other in horror.
