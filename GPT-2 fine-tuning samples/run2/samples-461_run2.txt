 minutes at the office.

By two o'clock at night, there was hardly any time for anything else in the morning. The phone was ringing steadily, and the two of us talked for a while, then each of us turned to look at the other.

As soon as Jamie’s voice was on the phone, Abby called Mallory and Stacey, who were sitting in the director’s chair instead of Mary Anne’s chair. I was thrilled to see a new girl in school.

“New Girl,” Mary Anne replied. “I saw your math homework at a special class that afternoon. It’s called Preacher. You may be ready about this soon.”

We all smiled. “Aye,” Mary Anne said. “Yes? Well, I guess you know everything there is to know about the kids in math class and what is going on in science …”

Shaking her head, I said, “I guess I am, but I have to study stuff in a different place and then I just don’t know exactly where I’m going. I love math.”

Stacey nodded. “A good grade,” she said. “You may be able to earn a new grade in English again soon, since your spelling is in the right place, but stay with us for this one. See you soon.”

And that was how I met Shannon (now Mary Anne’s other best friend) and Kristy. She is so full of energy and enthusiasm for schoolwork.

As the months went by, Kristy (and I) got more and more used to each other. The last time Dawn met, she brought her a bag of potato chips and said, “Good, we’re friends,” so Kristy put them on a plate and gave Shannon a potato chip. Shannon was going to be a “foodie.”

“Thanks, Dawn,' said Mary Anne.”

The phone rang. We were in luck when our club meeting fell a minute late.

I called Dad, who was sitting by the receiver straight away. “Baby-sitters Club.”


As I got on the phone, Kristy Thomas made me go back to bed. “Wake-up call.” I picked up my homework on the same day.<|endoftext|>
I've never slept through a movie in a night before — and never even seen a director or a director's chair. On the other hand, I've been dreaming about this for over a year now. I was planning on writing a book about my little brother Richard's bedroom. In it, I'll tell you how to write and illustrate kids — my own stories. I also plan to bring a children’ book by my best friends, called The Richard Babadir Life.

I'm sure I'll have to tell you more about my dream when the time comes.

Maybe you already know about it. I still live in this old farmhouse you can call your own. Dad and I were planning to move into this house in the middle of the night when the old clock turned from five-hundred to five-thirty. Suddenly the house seemed awfully full, and all my friends began laughing and saying "bye" and heading on.

But then the house didn't slow down. It nearly exploded. My brothers, Sam and Charlie, raced out to it. "The Babadir Life?" asked one of them, just as the flames exploded across Mr. Rutherford’s house.

"No!" I said. Then I sat up and looked around the room. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

He looked at me in the doorway. "I've just finished reading Your Royal Life," he said. "I’d like to write a book about it."

"The Babadir Life" is the story of Richard Babadir, the little boy who was eight. Before he was Richard Babadir, Richard lived in a barn near here in Rutherford, New Jersey. Suddenly he was so old, he’d left this wonderful house on some farm and moved into our neighborhood just west of here.

I was so psyched to be coming back. I already had this amazing ghost story told to me in the barn.

“All right,” said Mr. Rutherford softly, “how about an author-illustrator book of your own creations?”

“Wow,” I said. The author-illustrator seems to come in handy in ghost stories. I don’t think we’re too old for the jobs, but I like the idea.

Mr. Rutherford smiled and told
