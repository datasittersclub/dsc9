t’t there, I’m sure we’ll meet in the cafeteria when we need to be.<|endoftext|>
"It's good to be back in this neighborhood again, okay?" said Stacey.

"That's it," I said, waving at her.

Stacey nodded and nodded again.

"Okay, good," I said.

"But what about this afternoon? You’ll be here all day, I know, but you can still take care of yourself and everything. Everything." A soft squeak sounded from the corner of Mary Anne’s mouth and I missed it. "Okay, thank you very much, but I’ll take it. It will be okay."

Mary Anne was looking at me and, like some kind of super-protective, hyper-protective mother, she couldn’t believe it, but she was going to do every single workday, night, and every other weekend. She’s probably the most talented baby-sitter she knows, and when she does she can’t be shy about telling me something about the baby-sitting experience she has.

Mary Anne, by the way, is very stubborn and shy and also happens to be a little bossy. She hates being in the way of other baby-sitters at all times. She’s the one who convinced me last summer that my dad was breaking up with Emily Michelle. So she took me and Kristy and me and Dawn and Jessi and Stacey and Claudia and, of course, Claudia and Stacey and Emily Michelle to a meeting of the Baby-sitters Club, my best friend and the founder of the NPS.

Our meetings ran from three-thirty until six, and during those minutes I always felt very, very alone. I’d been thinking about a simple solution to the problem of missing work; that was not how our business was running. I had wanted to do two things at once, work and play. One of them would be to make the afternoon even more fun, the other would be to get back home. But I didn’t know what, exactly, the solution would be, so I just sat there, staring at the clock.

Mom and Dad had discussed a lot of stuff over the years, but I had never discussed it with them about whether they were going to have to bring up another baby. But I was worried that it would be too late. I guess it’s hard to imagine having a second baby, right? So I had to start a conversation.

The moment the conversation had ended I stopped working. It was early afternoon, so the whole place was quiet. As I turned toward Claudia, I heard a knocking on the door. "Hi, Mrs. Brewer, would you be willing to take this job?" I asked.

"Sure," said the blonde-haired girl.

"Mrs. Brewer, I’d like to have someone go home with one of your kids," said Kristy, turning to go inside. We all did, and we found ourselves the happiest two minutes in the whole club. Claudia was in her usual place on the floor, sitting in the director’s chair in the back of my room, writing down all the information about the kids she was going to ask for.

"You mean, you and I would like some help with a little mess?" Kristy continued. "I think my family would like your help."

"You don’t make me a problem," I said. "But we want to have someone take care of this children’s problem. Wouldn’t it be better if you could do the job as directed?"

"Sure, I can do it." (I couldn’t believe it, since I was in my usual place. I looked at Kristy.)

I had the good news — a new client with a couple of kids. My family had come to see me, and Mary Anne gave it to us, too. (The BSC is so helpful.) When the phone rang, we looked up, and we found that Mrs. Brewer was available to talk. The girl was Kristy Thomas.

We talked about how much Mrs. Thomas missed us and how she missed her three kids. Then Mrs. Thomas asked if she could take a second child, and it was very helpful, because she knew Kristy would say yes. We also talked about how important it is for us to help out with the kids, especially the little ones. We talked about the work they can't do with the kids. Then we decided whether we should do it.

We were all so pleased to hear that we were almost sure to do it, but it was a hard decision. When they asked the person closest to take the job, Mary Anne gave us a
