======== SAMPLE 1 ========
s’s got a bag of cookies coming. I don’t have to wait in line for them to come around anymore, which is why I’m the last person to line up a pizza party. I’m not too far away from Kristy’s, right by the train station.

The last thing I’d thought about was Stacey’s. She and I had sat, but the last thing I did was stand still, staring at Claudia’s digital clock. I was worried that I’d miss an appointment, and I didn’t think Claudia would pass out during our meetings.

“I’d miss,” cried Claudia.

“Did you know,” said Stacey, who was sitting behind us as well as Claudia’s mom, with her long blonde hair and blue eyes. (Isn’t that red? Why does it always turn brown? I could tell right away. It’s because they’re all incredibly shy with their personalities. Stacey is. Her hair is really pretty. She wears glasses, which gives her a hard time and makes her appear more mature.) But Stacey was not alone with her thoughts. The rest of us were more interested in Claudia. I was.

Claudia’s father used to live at Stoneybrook Elementary, but he left when school started, leaving her here to take care of Claudia and her family. The only time he left her was at the beginning of junior high, when David Michael was about to be sent to California. It was the beginning of Claudia’s relationship with Claudia, and it was one of the happiest times of her life.

The reason she moved to California right away was because her dad had decided to stay in New York City. That made California a perfect fit, so he transferred David Michael, his younger brother, and Claudia to Stoneybrook, and they have remained there ever since. Claudia and David Michael live with their parents in a farmhouse across town. When Claudia gets away, they take David Michael’s older brother with them, but it doesn’t bother her much. She’s happy, though, to live there.

“So,” said David Michael, “you got two jobs,” and Mary Anne said, “now” and then I said we’ve got jobs to do.” (Well, one, two, three jobs. That’s what happened at the meetings.)

“I don’t think we should call a meeting again about that,” said Claudia. (Claud does go back to New York to visit her dad before he gets sent back.)

“I think I’m going to stay here with your mom as long as it doesn’t take too long,” said David Michael, “and as long as I don’t have to worry about moving back to Stoneybrook. I have a new baby coming, and we can’t let you get the most out of it. You can take care of me.”

“I don’m leaving,” said Stacey.

We all took a deep breath. Then I saw that David Michael has a job. David Michael, to me, is the only one who does a lot of the baby-sitting. His job is to help baby-sit and be ready for their mothers. His job is also always busy. So the problem is the same with David Michael: He doesn’t love to take them all. But Mary Anne and Dawn seem to like him. Dawn is a nice, friendly girl who’s a tomboy on the beach, so he takes care of her well. He has two older brothers (and a younger one) and a sister with her. And while Mary Anne has a boyfriend, Dawn has a baby brother, Squirt. (He’s a baby-sitter! Whew, the BSC!)

Mary Anne grew up in Stoneybrook, so she’s the closest thing to a sister in the city, which seems weird to her. Plus, I guess that means that everyone keeps in touch. (The BSC is a little brotherly toward the end. But it’s not too loud. We like each other.)

If Mary Anne was sitting in Dawn’s room, Dawn might be feeling a little rushed. She's on the phone with one big boss, Claudia (my other two brothers).

I glanced at Dawn. She was standing in front of the computer.

“Let’s do this,” said Claudia (she didn’t say she was sure, but she was right. Claudia isn’t that guy, after all …
