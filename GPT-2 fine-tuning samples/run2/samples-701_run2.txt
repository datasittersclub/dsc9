======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Dawn I’m about nine years old.

“Here she is, Mary Anne!” Claudia cried.

“Hi,” Jessi called to the others, who were still standing watch.

Mary Anne climbed onto the bed and reached behind her night table against Claud’s, careful not to push Claud around. She picked up a box of red polka dot nail polish.

I thought, if my friends could make one thing, one thing only thing at this stage in a life cycle, I’d say nail polish goes in a nail ring, just like a wedding ring.

I got three polka dots right out of the box. One for every hair, each dot marked a baby with a different name. For each of my friends, I’ve got two different names for a bunch of other things, and one of them is probably a little late to the party. Lazerzy, clear, almost shiny, with dozens of tiny shiny ruffles.

The name — LUV! — came to me naturally. That means it describes my use of it.

Here’s some more club stuff. I love sports, but coaching a pro team for fun is no easy job. It takes too much commitment, energy, and dedication. (Some kids say I have to do the Impossible Three Impossible Things a Day.) Plus, if I want to be competitive in the gym, I have to spend hours training. I hate being in the smallest detail in a project. And I hate the long stretches. Luckily, as far as the club goes, I enjoy the extra work.

But the hardest part of the job is probably the club notebook. It’s a sort of diary in which we write up every single job we go on. Then we read it up on repeat jobs. Usually everyone caught on was delighted to receive a promotion, so they wrote in, saying they were so delighted that they went on a new family vacations, and baby-sat at our houses. (Which is a little like saying you’re in the sixth grade when all the new girls come to visit instead of eighth and tenth grades.)

Each club member has at least one other important notebook or diary, and that is where Stacey comes in.

The club notebook is where we write in it all about what happened on our club business.

What was the baby?

Who made the dinner table chair?

Who made up the chalkboard at the back of the room?

I just finished writing in the club notebook. (I was not doing it because I am more of a business student than the rest of the seven people in the class, but simply because I love writing in general.)

Did anyone else play baby-sitting?

No way!<|endoftext|>
I sighed, and looked at Momo.

She shook her head. "I think you guys are ridiculous," she remarked.

"No! What funny?!" I wanted to tell her. I stood up to be enveloped in the warm glow of Mother's Day. "Sorry, Momo. I had to take a few photo ops before I made my announcement."

Momo gave me a big hug. "Good luck with your baby-sitting commitment," she said.

I stretched. Momo is a terrific person for baby-sitting. You know how you sometimes tell her she is a genius?

She smiled. "You did a pretty good job on that one," she said. My sister, Nannie, who was with me, took another photo of me standing at Momo’s place. Then I stood up and smiled at Momo.

I felt relieved. What other kind of person would want to have a sitter with me? I mean, Momo is my sister, and even though I have a very private nature, she doesn’t want me to take any of her sitting jobs.

And, of course, I am a professional baby-sitter. I try not to take jobs I don’t understand so well; Momo isn’t dumb. Nor is Claudia, the eighth-grader who is the club secretary.

The only person not to mind a bit overworking her shoulder is Stacey McGill, the club treasurer. She needs money to pay her bills, and that afternoon she sent two raffles for it. One for a pizza party, and the other for a Halloween treat. No one had ever received a raffle ticket before, so she was glad she got them, but it wasn’t the sort of thing to go shopping.

Stacey is also a math whiz. She’s the only member of the club who knows the numbers at the end of a number, and she’s also excellent at keeping track of numbers.
