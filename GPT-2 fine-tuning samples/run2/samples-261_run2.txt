, we'll have pizza for every job.

Okay, enough talking. Let's call our next meeting — and we'll have lots of business — about the upcoming meeting of the Baby-sitters Club, which will be held on Saturday, September 5, from 5:00 to 6:00, at the BSC booth at our house. We'll start off by ringing the doorbell to Stoneybrook’s oldest private school, the BSC (ahem, probably not), and giving kids our first official hello. We ’m very friendly, but a little nervous.”

“Hello, Mrs. Stoneybrook?” asked Kristy.

“Uh … yeah?” I said. “I'd just got a new baby in town. See, I’m the president of the club.”

“Oh. Well, I know the club doesn’t come to meetings, but Mrs. Stoneybrook, as president, you have her card.”

Mary Anne was waiting for us with wide open arms. “How is she doing?”

“What’s wrong?”

“I’ll check with her.” (We usually do. And when we’re on the phone, we usually tell her about club jobs.)

We sat down. “Mrs. Stevenson is just arriving today, and she’s wearing this wonderful, really cool, big, black shirt with blue ribbons all over her body. “In fact, I’m convinced that she’s wearing a super-sport uniform, and she’s in the middle of some sort of ballet class. And that’s all she’s wearing these days, with her tight-fitting black boots and her long black hair.”

“I love the outfits.” Mary Anne nodded. Her eyes were just as clear as Kristy’s. “She’s wearing what used to be her hair, and there’s this big-print skirt. Her hair is a mess.”

“Great, so what else?"

Mary Anne shook her head. “But you’ve never seen her hair, or even seen her blush.”

“Oh, no!”

“It’s red, but …”

“’mash!”

“I love red, too, Mary Anne,” interrupted Kristy. Mary Anne, who had just gotten settled right in, wore a very sophisticated outfit (mostly black and tan) with black and black-and-white-print ribbons flying all over her skin. “Like these big orange hoop earrings, with these little yellow star-shaped beads, shining blue ribbons above the yellow stripes underneath. And, of course, a big red tassel, which hangs all over the tiniest of people. (The tan could have melted my love for red.)

Mary Anne looked at Kristy, who was still staring down the TOTW card Mary Anne had been writing. “Okay, Mary Anne,” she said, trying to make herself appear as genuine as she did. Her eyes were shining and her mouth was moving. “You know what outfit you would like so badly? You wouldn’t make a bad outfit.” She glanced at the other members of the BSC, then to the president of the club, and said, “Yes, Mrs. Stevenson? Mary Anne, I’ll call you back shortly. Bye.”

When Mary Anne and Richard hung up, I said, “I don’t know, Mary Anne. But I like you a lot, Richard.”

“Hey, Kristy. I don’t think I’ll ever be the only person Mary Anne would like. But I do think we’re all pretty different.”

“Oh. Well, I guess you should call Mrs. Stevenson.”

Mary Anne cleared her throat. “I miss you, Richard.”

“Good-bye, Richard.”

“Thanks a lot, Mary Anne and Kristy. I miss you the best.”

“Well, Richard, that means I’ll call you during your trip to visit your dad, not today.”

“Yes. That’s all I ask in that situation.”

“Your dad is sick. Is he going to come back to work?”

“Yeah, but I don’t know. … Well, Richard might be, but he’s
