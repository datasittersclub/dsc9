 putting a lot of work. She's had a lot of time to prepare and develop a great attitude. She is quiet and collected — but very assertive. I suppose she has to be. She has the biggest mouth on the planet.

Mary Anne is the eighth-grader. She's the only one of us with the same number of friends as everyone else. And she's the only one of us who has a steady boyfriend, Logan. Why? Because her family moved here from Connecticut in time for Thanksgiving Day — before the Ramseys. And not because Mary Anne has a boyfriend. That's a different story. There are three friends of Mary Anne's who stay in the Ramseys house. They're Kristy, her brother Charlie, and Shannon, whose father's job suddenly became a job of theirs.

They're pretty different, I guess. Both are more sophisticated than the rest of us. For example, Shannon is white, Shannon is tall and slender, and Shannon is slender and athletic. But she is not a professional soccer player. That's because she's out in California playing for a softball team. And she had to compete every day, even to death, because she was so hungry.

But the Ramseys did not let their black and brown people get them down. They let them get in — and out.

That's because their family moved with them into the Ramseys house. There, their mother and father still live in the Ramseys' mansion, but the Ramseys keep it close! The rest of us live there too. We all like it.

Mary Anne is also outgoing and very understanding. She's an excellent writer and an inspiration to people of color. She even has her own private jet. But she doesn't have a private plane, only a flight to and from Connecticut.

That's why she's our alternate officer. It's a job she does for the rest of her family. At first they thought she could do it, since her father is on vacation. But as time went on she grew and she got used to her responsibility. So she's been on the plane, doing more things than just sitting for my friends in Connecticut, though.

In addition to her acting background, Mary Anne plays sports, especially track, and she's an especially good student. She's a member of the Honor Society, the Astronomy Club, and the Honor Society's Honor Society. She takes ballet and is one of the dancers.

But, as I said, she's quiet. She's a hard worker. And she's not particularly good at sports. She would rather be at school than attending school, but, naturally, she'd rather get to her B.As than go to Stoneybrook Middle School.

She's a good student too. She also has her own phone line, which is another reason she's our second-grade sitter. We have a good idea of our sitting schedules, though, so we're all pretty organized.

Also, not long ago, the Ramseys' other high school friend was getting her hair cut in a competition. But she tried on a blonde wig, which wasn't cut very well, so she let her hair drop to show off. And, as she walked down the aisle, it was raining. Her hair was in a big pout.

One thing that Mary Anne can do well is be herself. She does everything in her power to be an official BSC member. That includes getting to know all the BSC members. I'll tell you about some of them later that day, anyway.

But I'll tell you about Claud, and about her family, first. She’s a big baby, with eight tiny ears and brown eyes. She has red hair and pale skin. Her father’s company, Claudia’s company,’s parent company, has been bought off when Claud had to take a job with a new company. Claudia’s father also moved back to Stoneybrook from California. The company was required to pay him back in cash, so he had to pay Claudia back for doing her homework.

Claud’s parents moved back here because their old house was sold, and Claudia’s dad still lives there. And they’ve been moving in since Claud started school. (Claud has a new room and a whole new phone line, and her brother Charlie’s.) They’ve kept Claud and Claudia on their street, except for one time when they were living across town from one of them. In the middle of that move, Claud had grown up here after her father’s company left her in California. She’ve lived there until now, but she’d decided that it might actually happen. So once again the house was sold. I guess that’s a good thing, because there is still a lot of soul in the house.
