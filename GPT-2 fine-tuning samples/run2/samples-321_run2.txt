I sat for a second in the dark. Finally, the phone rang.<|endoftext|>
I was right back in my bedroom that night, when my mother had gotten home from the office. I couldn't tell him that. He didn’t. I told him about it just then, in the usual way: “I’ve got news. Mr. Ramsey’s going to be getting another baby. I haven’t even started to think about him.” As my mother got home, I hung up and looked at my clock: 5:28 P.M. That’s when Claud asked, “You know, Mom, will you be available, please? You’ve got to help.” Claud gave me a knowing look.

“Haven’t you guessed? I just got a really big baby-sitting job.” I asked.

“Yeah,” replied Claud. “Well,” (I said this with a slight smile on my face, as I think I’ll have to do some research before I say it) ’I’ll be home by five.”

I was already in the dark, waiting for my own brother to call. But when Mr. Ramsey called, the phone rang.

“Hello?” I said.

“Hello?” answered the man in a loud voice.

“You’re right.”

“I’ll be right back, I promise.” (Mr. Ramsey never seems stressed about anything.)

That shocked me. I almost choked. And just then, a voice in mine said, “Come on, call me.” (Mr. Ramsey always answers my calls at once.) I looked at it. It had this huge bald eagle with a big mouth, and it was calling. “Aha-ha!” It sounded like a baby.

Okay, okay. I guess some of this made me forget to think about it right then.

“Aha-ha!” said the voice, “I’m getting a baby-sitter for you.” I looked at the clock. 5:29. I knew that when I got to 5:30, I was at least ready for home.

So I knew that it was only right that I called.

I hung up. “Hello, Baby,” I told him. “Baby-sitter,” I suggested. (By the way, that means whoever’s home at 5:00 — the only person who can take responsibility for holding my baby.” I always take what I have.)

“Good idea.” (Yes, Mom listened.) I told him why.

“Well,” he said, “I’ll have several hours.” I hung up. “I don’t think I’ll have an hour.”<|endoftext|>
I was waiting by the bus stop right across the street from Kristy, when I heard the first call. Whoosh. Then Dad! I cried. That’s when dad put his phone away.

“Hello?” Dad asked me.

“Hi, Karen!” I said.

“Hi, Shannon!” Dad called to tell me to take off my shoes.

“Hi, Shannon,” I said. “Hello, Baby-sitters Club. Just to give you a heads-up about what is going on,” Papadakis said.

“Uh-oh, yes,” I replied, trying to hear my dad's full name and address.

“No need to worry,” he said, “I’m not making a deal.”

I looked at Shannon and cried a little. Then we sat down on the bed and waited for Dad to call again.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club,” he told us. “Hi, Shannon. I’m calling you right now. My name is Logan Bruno, and I just heard that Mom and Dad are going to be having an emergency baby-sitting meeting.”

“What is that?” I asked.

“I don’t think so. It’s just a surprise.”

“Not an emergency?” I corrected him. “Nah. It’s just me.”

He gave me a quick rundown of his plans,
