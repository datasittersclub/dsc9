fish, carrots, cucumbers — you name it. Stacey would have the lead in ballet. She would have the lead in ballet. Stacey is also gorgeous. She has silky red hair and freckled skin with freckles. And, lest I forget, she’s a real knockout. She dresses like a professional ballet dancer — with head-to-head combat. Her moves, which are really artistic, are her ballet lessons. She puts them together in real time and adjusts to them. She’s even asked to do dances several times a week.

Mary Anne is my best friend in the world. We might even even be best friends, if we weren’t so serious about each other. But for now, I am.

Okay, back to business.

It was six after school and I was taking some family trips. I was staring down at my desk when Kristy grabbed it.

“Come on, Kristy,” she said urgently, “we’re taking vacation time. Mmm, oooh, so nice.”

“See? I better get organized.”

“What?” I blurted out.

Kristy pulled another bag of Doritos from her bag. “Doritos,” she called.

Mary Anne started to search her desk again. “Doritos,” she repeated. “I better get organized.”

I was on the verge of a huge brainstorm. I was trying to think of something to show everyone, and then I heard Miss Rutherford say cheerfully, “Doritos,” without looking at me.

“Who’s that?” I asked Miss Rutherford.

“Everybody!” giggled Miss Rutherford.

“I’ll pick up some,” I began to explain to my teammates.

“You guys are not picky,” said Miss Rutherford.

“Yeah,” I managed to say. “Come on, all the way. We can relax. We’ll just leave you hanging.”

“Okay,” said Miss Rutherford. She hung up the phone and turned to me. “Come on, Kristy, relax.”

I don’t care who is taller than me, Claudia does. That’s the way we operate.

The idea came to my mind a lot. I wonder if it’s a good idea to be doing a family business like the one we were doing today.

Okay, I’ve found a few other ideas. The one I was thinking about is called the Baby-sitters Club. I found their great idea some years ago (that was just me), but it was probably the most heartening to learn they needed more help from parents.

The club was originally my idea. It was just something I had seen a lot of people do — but now I see parents taking steps to fill in the blanks. Like the appointment pages in Stoneybrook Public Library. They keep track of available baby-sitting jobs and have even created a club ad on the Kishis’s official We Love Kids page.

It’s important to mention that I am sometimes in the middle of planning the club and always planning things for kids. It was my idea, too. And I just happen to love children. What could I have done without children?

My Baby-sitters Club baby-sitters meeting. (The meeting started at about five-thirty to me.)

Hi, class, it’s me. I’m the secretary of the club. I’ll keep this short. In this case, I’m running the club record book. I also hold the treasurer and the meeting the next day. During those meetings, which are held during meetings, I keep an eye on the budget of the club. If it’s a weekly family allowance, for example, that’s a requirement. I plan to contribute that money to a rainy day fund for our charity. I put the money toward a pizza party or a trip to the movies. Sometimes we get really creative. I put aside this money for a fashion shoot or a trip to the mall. I also plan out our Kid-Kits or box cars.

Here goes. At this meeting, we’d been talking about the budget items. What about the Kid-Kits? I told them about their special features and stuff. Then I told them about the theme of the week — aero rides or softball. I suggested that each of us take a Kid-Kit and turn it into a bike messenger. And what were they going to
