 was a natural anyway; she’s short, with brown hair and brown eyes. I guess she was worried about looks, maybe because her parents disapprove of her interest in sports (her hair is permed and she has no interest in anything else). Or maybe she had a good time with her older sister,” Dawn added. “What else happened?”

“I met these kids,” I said.

“Can’t you imagine that?”

“Me and my friends went to a concert in Stamford. We were wearing black shoes. Then the lights switched from blues to white.”

I smiled. “They were making a song called 'Duh-huh-huh' in which I’m the lead…. It wasn’t very good,” I said. “Now guess what — the lights switched back to blues as the song ended and we played the entire concert again.”

“It went great,” I said. “I could hear the blues playing in the background."

“Dawn, that’s one of the things I hated about the school year.” “How many more classes will this school be in?” she asked.

“I think I’ll take a second to think about that.” (Dawn has to sit a hundred different ways a day, and it seems like a long train ride) “Two hundred and fifteen,” said Dawn slowly, quietly, “I think. Three hundred and eleven,” she began slowly.

“Great,” said Kristy. “The music was good, but there was still just nothing left over.”

“We played the whole thing from about seventy-five to seventy-seven,” I told her, with some rehearsal help from Mary Anne. “I hope I’re lucky to find some of that stuff.”

“If that is the case,” Mal said, “you might want to go to Stoneybrook Manor and search there for some of that stuff.”

“Where did I tell you about it?” asked Dawn. “I wonder. I guess it looks like a haunted house.”

“It’s a haunted house,” I said.

“What kind of place is that?” asked Mary Anne.

“It’s a haunted house,” I said.

“Well, it’s full of stories, you know, stuff that’s old, hearsay, ghosts, stuff like that.”

“Oh, I knew about that,” said Dawn, smiling as hard as she could. “I don’t know too much about horses.” She pulled her hair back from her face. “I’ll just ask Dawn what happened.”

“Just telling the truth,” Mary Anne said. “Who put that?”

“You know your parents,” said Mary Anne. “I meant what I said. Why did your dad bring them up?” (Their parents had been friends all their lives, and had fallen in love with Mary Anne and Richard.)

“You meant it too, Dad!” I said sharply.

“I know what,” Mary Anne said. “I just wanted to tell you, Dad, all this.”

“It’s only fair,” said Dawn, just as sharply, “I’m allowed to talk.”

Mary Anne lifted her eyebrows a couple of ways up. “Don’t you want to talk?”

“Oh, yes.” I did. “It’s not fair.” I didn’t expect her to back away or anything, but she did. ”

“How old were you then?” asked Dawn.

“I guess I was seventeen.” She looked worried. “Did you want to talk about it?”

“I’d like to talk about it,” I said. “I don’t know how to talk.” Mary Anne smiled and smiled back with some rehearsal help.

I was disappointed. It wasn’t like “real,” I realized. “There’s no real old-school.”

“Well, there was,” I said. “I guess then, anyway.” I was looking at Dawn. She was
