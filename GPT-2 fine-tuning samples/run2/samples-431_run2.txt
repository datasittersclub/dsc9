ies and her mom. The rest of us — except for Claudia and Janine and Logan Bruno — are thirteen and in the eighth grade. Why? Well, because my dad works as a secretary at a publishing house in New York City. Plus he's so weird. He doesn't let us talk on the phone interfere. Anyway, Claudia (who is very interested in mysteries) is one of five kids in her family who are older. Her parents are not — you know, very advanced. They are, however, very reasonable — just like Mal's parents.

Claudia is the shyest, nigglest, nicest one of us. She can dress any way she wants. She has long blonde hair that she wants cut to the point of obsession and pierced ears and, like Kristy, she loves sports. Claud is also a soccer player. She played a little less than perfect soccer at school, but now she's used to it.

Claud is one of our two junior officers, which is Kristy, since she's the other. It seems fitting that Claudia, who is very quiet, would have a private phone line, since her parents don't share that private phone line. Her sister, Janine, has a phone line, too. Which is great, since there's another sister that Claud never had a phone call. We have two associate members — Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne. They aren't allowed to sit for the same boy too many times a week (unless he's off sick), especially not at night.

By Monday afternoon, we had about four people left of us, so I guess we’d all be overrun. I’d promised I would list those people (the BSC meets on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons), and here’s what they are:

Jessi Ramsey, our junior officer. The other members of the BSC are Mal, Stacey, and Claire. They’re best friends. We call them just about anything, but I guess they only talk about art when they need it the most. Kristy is artistic, so I guess she and Jessi are alike in each other’s way, which is why they dress like an artist. Plus there are them right here — in Stoneybrook’s finest clothing. And they have the most interesting kids — Mal and her eight-year-old sister, Janine. They’re two and a half, and they’re very smart — but they’re different in other ways too.

For instance, they have opposites petiole and cartilage, and the difference in the cartilage. Janine is short for Emily Michelle and tall for Jessi. They’re only best friends, and they are different in so many ways.

For instance, Jessi’s skin is medium blue and clear, and she has light blue eyes with dark, freckled freckles. She’s our jock, but she’s also a terrible liar, as well as a terrible ballerina, as well as a good dancer and an excellent writer and a well-bred writer. (Her best friend is Stacey McGill, who has an older sister who also loves to write stories.)

Anyway, Jessi and Mal are best friends because they both have brown hair and brown eyes. Mal likes to dress very cool and sporty, and Jessi is very sporty, too. She’s a great girl, in her own way, and she’s a good student. But Jessi and Mal have had some fights, because Jessi’s a diabetic and her body can’t process sugars correctly. So Jessi has to monitor the nutrition in her blood, give herself daily injections (ew) of something called insulin, and watch her diet. She’s lucky to have that kind of care and nutrition. Jessi is also a diabetic herself. She has to breathe poison dart clouds through her nose every single day.

Finally, Dawn is Mal’s sister. Dawn’s the only member who is older and blonde, and she’s as smart as Jessi. The two of them know each other better than the rest of us.

Dawn, who is originally from Long Island, was our alternate officer in high school. She had to convince the rest of us to join her at all times. Dawn is the most sophisticated, most brilliant girl our club has ever had. She has blue eyes and a complexion that is as red as Mary Anne’s. Her clothes look fantastic (except for Doc Marten hats) and she has thick, brown hair that she keeps in pigtails. She wears jeans, a sweatshirt, and a turtleneck shirt. She’s the oldest kid in her family, so she is used to her appearance. Mal and Dawn are very different in other
