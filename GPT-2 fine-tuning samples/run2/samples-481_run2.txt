======== SAMPLE 1 ========
The girl who coaches a team for little kids called Meals on Mondays is about to have all the fun some callow girls can give her. (Maybe that's why she’s already been sitting at the local table all week.)

In fact, Jessi has the fun and attention-grabbing qualities that make her perfect for the BSC. You see, the girl in the picture at the top of this page was Stacey McGill, the BSC’s secretary. She is also the inspiration for the BSC notebook. This is a book that we each write in and out during meetings. We each read the notebook once a week to get up-to-the-minute information about our clients. When a call comes in, Kristy will write a summary about the meeting and everyone can “crawl,” she told Kristy. Kristy is what Kristy is not — funny, funny, sophisticated and full of energy. And a complete junk food addict.

You haven’t even told me that Claudia Kishi is going to have a baby! She just comes at me like it says: Claud, what is it? ’Oops! I ran out of milk!”

“Oh, well, good luck!”

I smiled. If Claudia’s milk was still on the table, all the way down to her tapering off position, I knew we had a baby.

“Oh, please, Mary Anne,” Claudia said.

Mary Anne looked surprised. It was the first thing she said when Kristy and Stacey announced that Dawn Schafer, who was already looking surprised, was back to tell us her baby was born. But then I took her into my arms and kissed her. Good-bye, Dawn. Thanks a lot, just remember to bring your valentines and T-shirts by Monday!

Kristy looked pretty happy, after taking down the flyers, which were filled with the BSC’s official greeting, and then, as always, he smiled. It was good to see him.

We were about to ring the bell when the phone rang again.

Kristy checked the BSC record book, which was sitting in the room next to her (the last one was opened up) and behind her (the other one opened up) and said, “Hello, Baby-sitters Club. ’All right, we have more business. ’Bye.

“Order.” She picked up the phone. “Hold on, let’s just take it. It’s my turn now.” She picked up the record book, but not fast enough. Kristy called back Claudia and suggested that Kristy and Stacey talk about their baby-sitting jobs. Then they could schedule new clients. They were both late, so Dawn pulled her car up, pulled her car off the road, and began driving the car around the city. One after the other, they did a bunch of these scheduling stuff.

Eventually (I should probably say it was too late), the BSC realized that the club was in need of more great sitters. As it turned out, the club had formed a new club, the Baby-sitters Club, and we were the first one of its kind in Stoneybrook.

This is how the club became successful. We each had a sitting job and met on several regular afternoons, and other regular times. The club works as described, but we concentrate all the time on holding regular business meetings.

Claudia is usually the one to get all the phone calls. You know, the one who just wants to call us and not make stupid, late phone calls. Then she does it twice a week and once a week and twice a week and seven days after that. I always have to tell her what I think. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the last time we were in the basement of the Basement Club. At five o’clock on the first Tuesday of the month the club was flooded with calls. We’d had enough calls. We called Claudia back to tell her that there had been a job offered. This was at exactly the right time, on Monday, and three business days after her letter was addressed that Monday. The baby-sitting had officially come to us.

I don’t know if Stacey has ever done this, but she usually does. Usually that Monday she writes to Claudia and she gets back to her usual appointment times. Stacey and Claudia have known each other a long time, and always treated each other with respect.

Anyway, in my picture, Stacey is sitting at a table with the other members, Dawn in the backseat, and Claudia and Anna in the front. Stacey has long, long, long blonde hair and dark
