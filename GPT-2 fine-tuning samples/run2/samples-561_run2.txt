 girlfriend for the first time. In the beginning, it was just Dawn, Mary Anne, and her dad, Richard. As time went by they began to see each other. In the beginning, each of them loved kids, but when Dawn's dad fell in love and married the wonderful Karen and raised the family himself (he's a millionaire) he got married and that was Dawn and her mother and her dad.

Then Dawn's mom married Watson Brewer, a great guy. He fell in love with Mary Anne and she and her family moved across town into his mansion. It was crazy! How amazing that they finally got married! It was so romantic. They had Dawn, Mary Anne, Karen, Richard, and their dog, a cat, and a puppy. (Oh, and then there would be Kid-Kits, which are boxes full of stuff we bring along on our jobs, but we don't take them with us on jobs that involve little kids.) Soon they were all living in a mansion (their stepsister lives in California) and Dawn and MaryAnne joined them. They even became a little kids' book-club friend.

At first, Mary Anne just couldn't believe it. Watson and Dawn were best friends, but soon they discovered that their love of books stemmed more in part from Mr. Spier's wife than from their marriage. Mrs. Thomas remarried. (After that, we didn't even have to talk about our long-term families.) Mary Anne and Watson got divorced (Watson leaves her on top of things, and now Mrs. Thomas works full-time) and Mr. Spier moved back to Stoneybrook, with his business next door. Now Mary Anne's been through the same thing. She gained new friends and an older brother, and a little help from her old one.

Mr. Spier says she looks and acts the same as he did when she was a baby. That's because he gave her a steady diet of vegetables and grasses, and she has a little bit of a "fair share" of her strict, but responsible eating habits now. He looks that way because he doesn't go around being a complete bag-grabber or making sloppy ear-muffs and calling Dawn fat. He also wears his long, white-blonde hair "fairly" and he has a smiley and tawny-looking face with sandy brown highlights. (Boy, do I miss Mr. Spier and all his clothes.)

Now, on to the BSC. I'm the vice-president.

Yes, actually. That's how we form the club. Well, we're the only club members who are all baby-sitter and treasurer. (Because of that, we can't do phone calling or collect dues.) We don't need to bother with lots of official club business. We can take the phone call at will and make a definite, definite, definite call.

We meet three times a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from five-thirty to six. Our clients have seven or eight available. We arrange for phone calls and use the club treasury money for special events. That way, during the club years, we have plenty to spend. We don't have to give up the occasional pizza bash or party at the beach, or spend any penny on a Snickers bar (the BSC does that quite a lot).

We use the treasury money to contribute to Claudia's phone bill and to pay Charlie gas money, to pay for part of the gas money Claud needs to be on call all the time so she can help out at this very minute.

I'm the alternate officer. That means I have the same duties as the regular officer. I'm the alternate officer when anyone is away on a school trip, or during a meeting, or otherwise not at the club meetings.

When I'm absent or if something is terribly important, I'm the alternate officer. This means I have the same responsibilities as the regular officer (except for babysitting, of course), except for one important difference.

The BSC has rules, you name it. The rules. But they're pretty confusing. In case you've wondered, I've explained them in the last few pages of the club notebook, so keep an eye out.

Okay. That covers everyone. But let me begin at the beginning. The club is very simple. We're all in it together.

At our meetings we only use the money for sitting and paying our expenses. That covers club dues (which never wear out the treasury), and we use it to buy my phone and an earpiece notepad, plus new supplies for my mom and brothers (her invention). Plus I keep up a fund-raiser for Kid-Kits for our charges.

How is it made? Simple.

Our dues money goes for meals. Kids love kits. Mom and Dad love the Kid-K
