’s always nice, but if I wear my hair long or change my hair way too much it can get out of control. I also have to spend a lot of time on my Look. Mostly, that’s because my mom lets me do a lot of makeup and stuff, too. (Before I began taking my Look, I couldn’t stand the fact that Claudia couldn’t help it.)

Sometimes I have a Look I just couldn’t stand, too. For example, at thirteen or so I really got into the Look I love — the summer sitting season in general. Regular sun and cool weather just keeps my Look fresh. This summer I was wearing a gray day shirt, a red wool jumper with a white flouncy chapeau patch on the shirt, purple Doc Martens on my sweater, and purple Doc Martens under the skirted blue pants I’d bought in the baby-sitting contest that Friday. Towel stuffed with fabric that looked as if it were from française, not soft. Underneath the flouncy chapeau patches were two white Doc Martens that were much warmer than the soft fabric. I pulled the underthings into my large bag of clothes and pulled off a gray striped blouse with gray china print on it.

The blouse was one of my baby-sitting experiences. Like my two cents about Deb's color, I’d been "correct" about Deb's hairstyle; I’m dumbfounded by Deb’s dad’s dumb stepdad’s! But then I saw this picture of my little brain wedged between a pile of tissues (Van Doorn and Shea, Kleenex and Pringles) and a manila envelope. It made me super excited.

Soon I was in my own bedroom, which is where my brother and I usually hang out. (He drives us to my meetings.) The front door to my secret passage, the double doors that lead from my room to the train station, are locked, except for a few members of the BSC, such as Claudia Kishi and Stacey McGill. As BSC secretary, she has the very important job of keeping the record book.

The record book was my idea, too. I don’t have many baby-sitting jobs, even though I do a great deal of work, and I’m very responsible about keeping track of the numbers we go on after we make our first appointment. That day, for example — and it was five-twenty strong — I raced off my bike and made my way to Claudia’s bedroom.

“Hi, girls,” asked Stacey, as I entered Claudia’s room. “Friday? Oh, right. Friday afternoon. We’ll let you know.”

“All right!” Stacey yelled. “We can jump right into Saturday’s game.”

That brought our next stop. Our morning jobs: those of Stacey, Dawn, and me.

Our morning jobs: Stacey’s number one (if you can believe that’s not a bad way to begin with) and Claudia’s (I’m sure you’d agree that’s not one of your basic human qualities.) Stacey is a talented artist who does a lot of things that make a person’s “appearance, appearance, appearance of course.” She is the person I would have picked over as the “baby-sitter” at SMS. That means her creative room is her gallery, and her bedroom is a work of art exhibit hall.”

Claudia was already working on her “art ‘in‘ ” and creating ‘pop culture” ’ herself,” Kristy Thomas, our club president, was saying that after the meeting ended, Stacey asked Stacey about her “art in’ and ‘art out’.” (That’s saying a lot, but not a bad word to use if you want to know what’s really going on in her bedroom.)

Mary Anne Spier (who had just come in) entered the room around noon, just as Kristy finished telling everybody about the Baby-sitter Special. “This is really interesting,” she said.

Stacey McGill said after she talked to Mary Anne that afternoon. “One of the things I wanted to ask you guys is … is how did the BSC come to the decision to start handing out fliers these last two weeks? I know we have a lot on our plate but I figured they’d be a good idea,” she informed everyone. “But before we go any further, let me just say that we
