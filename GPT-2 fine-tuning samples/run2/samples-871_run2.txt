 blood on both arms.

I looked at her.

“I can't wait to see your face in the mirror, Mal. That’s what happens when you wear the wrong outfit.”

“It isn’t so bad,” Jessi said sternly. “I don’t believe this outfit says anything about me. Everything I wear is carefully chosen. I wear my hair the way I want it. Sometimes I wear my hair the way I like it. I wear my hair the way I like it. I don’t change my mind at all at first.”

Kristy raised her eyebrows quizzically.

“You know,” Jessi said, “that’s not a big deal. You don’t have to worry about who’s wearing what — it all just clicks.”

“I didn’t think so,” Kristy continued. “I just do things a little differently than what some of the other girls think.”

“Abby, you’re our medi-angel,” Abby corrected.

“Listen, Jessi and I are both a little nervous about their outfits. Don’t worry, though. I’ll be here for them.”

“I’ll get mine the old Seventies style, ladies and gentlemen,” Abby suggested.

“Newer look?” Claudia asked.

“I like mine with a fresh heart,” Kristy replied.

(Or a heart of new yucky, if you prefer the French name. Guess where the similarity ends.)

I glanced at the clock on Claudia’s bed. Eight o’clock. “This meeting will now come to order.”

“This is Stacey’s call,” Kristy said. “Any new business?”

“New business?” Claudia said.

“You know what?” Kristy called out.

I didn’t know what the new business was, but as soon as the clock turned from 5:30 to 6:00, I started to plan for it.<|endoftext|>
Stoneybrook Middle School, on the other hand, might actually be an easy school for a five-year-old to advanced. The English unit is pretty much the same as it was when I attended it. Except that there’s a big difference—for example, math in the English language, which is a second nature to most Americans. Stoneybrook is no exception to that fact.

“Look, let me explain some of what I know,” Kristy said. “We have a drama club, a French club, I know a lot about fashion, and a drama school is one of the most important subjects for a student to learn.” She paused, and I knew she meant “mainly” the history of the school. Which is why I was so excited when I first called the elementary school. But maybe the school was going to change soon.<|endoftext|>
When I finished cleaning up after our last class of the day after our homeroom, Kristy was at the table behind me, reading a bag of Doritos. After I'd eaten them all, I went over to the second floor of the school. I looked around the corner, and everyone was there.

“Look out!' said Claudia, waving her hand. “We’re going to need a sitter for tomorrow. Mr. and Mrs. Kishi will be here to take care of some business you know….?"

“Mary Anne!” Claudia called from behind me.

“Uh-huh, Kristy? Um, maybe … maybe this afternoon I’m taking care of a job you don’t want to take, but which requires some kind of advanced manners — math, spelling, punctuality, good manners — you know, manners that … you know?”

“Oh, you mean the word ‘good manners?” I said weakly.

Kristy, Claudia, and I go on interweaving afternoon jobs right now. We don’t usually like them together, but since we’re best friends, let me introduce you to Kristy and her staff.

Good morning. How was your morning? Did you have a quick rundown of everything that’s happening today? Any morning business? I told you I might answer the door to your room in a minute. And when I did, I was met with clapping and shrieking.

No, it’s nothing compared
