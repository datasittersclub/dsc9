ister for several years and her younger brother, Jeff, who is a junior officer. Jeff has asthma and has been diagnosed with an asthma attack. (It wasn't until later that Jeff spoke to Dr. Andrew and asked for medical assistance.)

Jeff has had a lot of help with his asthma lately, since he has been very good at sports. But I love him for being a responsible, responsible parent, and he certainly has helped me a lot. My favorite athlete is Mary Anne. She was very careful about what she ate, especially chocolate (which she can make herself). I adore her. As club secretary, she makes sure that our records are up-to-date and up-to-date every job. Her job is like a club secretary. Every once in a while, I like to ask her to join another department.

I know she's smart, but I don't know her opinion on things like punctuality. She's not perfect, and she has a lot of opinions. For example, she had my opinion on baby-sitting for Abby and Mallory, but I didn't understand it. Her opinion was the exact opposite of mine. She thought Abby is a little shy and a little loud, but I was a lot loud and clear about her feelings. I didn't know what Abby or Mal thought of Stacey McGill's boyfriend, Logan Bruno.

Anyway, Mary Anne is totally understanding. She and her brothers and sisters are like a little bumpkin on my bike. No pun intended, anyway.

Stacey is Mal's older brother and sister, and his younger brother, Jeff. His name is Charlie DeWalt, and Mary Anne met him in high school when they were junior college roommates. Stacey grew up in Stoneybrook, and he went to practice in California before he was in the Big Five. He was then transferred to an older school. But Mary Anne and her friends were so wild about her, they came to the club for one reason or another! We all like to sit on our own jobs, and Stacey was thrilled when he was transferred to another school.

Stacey is also very creative. He likes to write in pencil and Nancy Drew books (and sometimes he even makes a little notebook full of pictures and stories), and occasionally he makes art for his own projects, mostly sketching on walls or other surface decor. Mary Anne is also not into old-fashioned clothes or junk food, but she does have a strict diet (mostly fruits, nuts, and legumes).

Jessi and Mal are two other junior officers in the BSC. The rest of us alternate members, which means we don't stay much longer than necessary. Jessi, another junior officer, is on trial with the BSC (a BSC trial began recently). They're the only other BSC members who are able to take nighttime job after nighttime sitting jobs. Mal's the only other member with steady job after job after job after job after job following her sister, Shannon. I think it's fair to say that Mal has made it very difficult for her father to raise her baby. She misses her dad so much that she hardly ever visits him.

The BSC was founded by Kristy Thomas (who, according to Kristy's story, is the only BSC member who can remember her name and her family), Mary Anne Spier (our vice-president) and two associate members, Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne. They're Kristy's best friend, and they both take summer jobs when the kids are at school. During summer they're out of California getting baby-sitters for their families, and Kristy's family travels the world for visits. The rest of the BSC members use the club funds we use to pay bills since we live in their house.

Kristy's family moved to Stoneybrook from New Jersey, where she grew up. She's not used to living in a typical neighborhood, but she definitely takes it one seriously. What's Kristy thinking about her new neighbors? I feel like I've been saying all along that she can make one mistake and everybody else be perfect … but I hear from everyone else. What's Kristy thinking? Is she crazy? Or are she just too stubborn?

It's hard not to be the only one with the little one.

It's hard not to be Kristy (although you might have to be if you're a real person). She always has clothes on (mostly designer, I suppose) and always has her hair in a ponytail. She dresses in a lot of different clothes, but the ones she chooses are very sophisticated and cool. Kristy is a member of the Honor Society — one of the oldest, most successful, most interesting and fashionable clubs in Stoneybrook.

I guess I have to leave you with one line of saying you're not allowed to do things Kristy doesn't wanna do. The rest of the BSC members seem to
