 we sit for only half a day and then come back to the room.

“I’m so sorry to hear about the vacation,” said Stacey, rolling up her sleeves.

“Well,” said Mallory, “there is more work than you guys can do. I miss you.”

“Uh-huh,” said Stacey, laughing.

“I was hoping you guys could help me deal with the kids,” said Kristy. That was a compliment I felt myself blush at.

“Hey, it isn’t like us,” I said. “Even though you and Kristy are different, you’re pretty close. You know that in some ways I’m jealous of, and I miss being with you. I miss meeting you all.<|endoftext|>
I was the first one to tell you how excited I was about the upcoming Valentine's Day. The idea had hit me so fast I almost forgot I was going to mention it. So I took a look at the calendar and decided it was for me. All the way back then, I was looking forward to seeing Lynn, the first one of us to go to Valentine’s Day Mall. She, along with Ashley Spier and Mallory Pike had arrived. Lynn, who was my stepfather, had invited me to his party. It wasn’t too late, though, since I already knew all about him. I knew everything about him. He’s cute and kind and quiet and sensitive at the same time. He’s an associate club member.

That was the beginning of my Valentine dream. My dad would have to approve. He would have to tell me he couldn’t believe I wasn’t there, and be mad at my sister. I’d have to admit I could have calmed down. I hated being reminded that Dad was upset.

I took some pictures. The Valentine portraits would show Lynn and her family, and I’d show them in reverse order. This wouldn’t be bad, and I was sure Valentine would be happy about it. I couldn’t wait to see what it would be like.

I took out my phone and set up some appointments. Then I put on my tuxedo.

When I came home and found my phone ringing and my stepfather already calling back with the date for the new date, I imagined it was Lynn calling back. I wished I could talk to him first. Then I’d guess what he was thinking. I could predict his response later, when the phone would ring again.

I knew the answer, and sure enough, it was Lynn. He was kidding. He said, “What the f—k is this?” and pointed to it.

I looked at my own picture. I’d seen Lynn when I was a little kid. In fact, when I’d seen her in that bikini, I’d watched her as she watched her stepsister.

I had hoped Lynn could explain to the older woman what a Valentine was, or maybe it would help me see her stepmother's date. I hoped he’d give me the hint that maybe since Lynn had gone to California with her stepfather several months ago, she was thinking of looking for a good local guy. I hoped she’d call me back soon.

I knew what I was looking for.

I got to my front gate. I looked at the valentine.

“Yyyyyyyy!” I said. It was Tuesday afternoon, and the staff had only just started to call me up. They were filling my room. There was no way I could wait. I knew I could make my Valentine impression in this city I grew up in. No way!

I made my own picture and wrote it on the wall. I was surprised I ever made my picture big enough for everyone to see, but now I didn’t mind. I love to tie up a collie with my picture. It’s very cool.

I closed my door. I took a picture of a collie and put it on the wall. I hoped people would understand how important the Valentine symbol is to me. The pictures are really special. I know it’s special for every single reason.

One reason I love pictures is that they offer a deeper understanding of what a character is. Something I’d come to know so well. I was surprised I’d seen it before. I looked at the poster I’d bought for the Valentine contest. It looked good on the arm of my arm. I took a closer look at the picture of what Valentine said. All my best Valentine pictures.
