 math of art. And math is a pretty big field, and I would never dream of being the vice-president of the eighth-grade class.

Mal was at that meeting, making her points about teacher evaluations, but she didn’t stop the rest of us from looking at her. We were amazed. And also, very pleased that way back when we were in eighth grade, Mal was never allowed to eat sweets. It was sort of a fashion thing — the same thing she was wearing the night before — and we liked her for it. But when she was wearing candy bars, we thought, What a joke! So we let her eat anything. She’s not allowed to eat sweets, except junk food, so she’s become very sick. Now, in the seventh grade, she can eat almost anything, even sweets: pizza, ice cream, fruit, meat. And she can’t eat sweets at all until she’s older. Her parents don’t think it’s fair for her to be treated this way. Maybe they don’t want to be Mr. Perfectionists, but you know what? I think they’ll never let her eat sweets. And even if they did, Mal would eat chocolate. She’s the shortest kid in our class, and she and the rest of the BSC members are pretty far along in the grades they don’t have to offer.

Mary Anne Spier is the club secretary, and she’s Kristy’s best friend. Like Mal, Mary Anne is short. But she’s allowed to wear whatever she wants, and she and Kristy are pretty alike about style. For example, in math, one of the neatest things about being a girl is that she can do anything. She practically has to do her homework and she gets to go to the movies pretty often. Maybe that’s a good enough reason for having her number-one-girl club.

Actually, Mary Anne is a real go-getter, since she’s the only one in the club, and she hasn’t abandoned her home life. In fact, she’s grown up in it. For instance, Mary Anne’s dad ran out on her family back when she was six. Now I know why. He saw how hard it was for her mom to find a sitter for David Michael (that was her only true blue on the whole). He took her to a tutoring session, taught her how to read a book, and even made her go out with guys before she knew it. Plus, he made a lot of adjustments at the beginning of seventh grade, which gave Mary Anne a lot of freedom. She can choose to follow any of the men she chooses.

Another great thing about Mary Anne is that she doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, only her mom, who gave birth to their baby boy, Andrew, this Wednesday. Maybe someday, just as baby-sitting is done, Andrew will be able to walk. Mary Anne is also very pretty. And I think the best part about her clothes are the original leotards she bought for the evening shift in the closet. Now she has the Look, Andrew has the Look, and Kristy has the Look. The trendiest of which is probably her blonde hair. Looks! And it’s beautiful. This is what Mary Anne looks like:

Here’s what she looks like:

Here are the four officers of the Baby-sitters Club (our club):

Club secretary, with only one associate who doesn’t attend meetings

Career-oriented, opinionated, and sometimes bossy

The hardest worker at the BSC (aside from being treasurer) is Claudia Kishi. I think I’m going to be queen of the hill in the next two weeks. Claudia has her own talents, her own personality, and she runs the club like a business. She’s a really talented artist, and she spends a lot of her free time drawing and sculpting. If her school friends could send her a telegram, she’d probably catch it. (The President of the Baby-sitters Club doesn’t.) She also coaches a softball team made up of kids who are the exact same age as her. That’s Claudia, and it makes her a sad movie star.

Claudia’s not really a sad person. She’s a really talented woman. She has two passions — art and ballet. Arts are math at age ten, and French at age seven. For most of her life she lived in New York, where she was a brat, having father and baby brother, along with her mom and her brothers, her father and her brothers’ father. But when Claudia moved to Stoneybrook with her
