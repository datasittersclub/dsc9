======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I sit in the director's chair.

The Brewers have had several business calls but have held steady. They call Claudia all over town to arrange sitting dates. (Claudia is one of the few people in the club who lives near Claud's, though.)

Claudia's the BSC's vice-president, mainly because of her position as treasurer. She collects dues every Monday and keeps track of how much she's earned: a spread of our money goes for Claud's phone bill. Kristy insists that we pay her brother Charlie to drive her across town to buy our occasional souvenir craft beer, and part of that price goes for occasional phone calls from the Brewers.

Claudia's one of a kind. As the oldest sibling of eight, she has a duty to represent the four of us. She needs time to prepare. Her first job as treasurer is basically to look after the kids we sit for at SMS. Claudia collects our dues each Monday and pays our bills. She also keeps a club notebook in which we write up every one of our jobs. Each of us has a notebook in which we write about our baby-sitting experiences. I have a real talent for writing entries that are long and suspenseful. For example, the notebook is where we write about a baby, who we are, who the baby is, who the dinner date is, who took our ballet class, who the evening spent sitting for Jenny.

Claudia is full of energy, but she is also a little bit casual. That doesn’t mean she isn’t a good baby-sitter. For a long time her parents were determined that Claud was too old (and too clumsy), and too young for school. They decided to get a real sixth-grade education, and Claud went to Stoneybrook High School, but somehow school really proved too hard for them. When they finally got together, they found out that Claud was a romantic. I’m sure they got along well enough. I remember the first time we went to a movie together, and we instantly became friends; I’ve been totally blown away by Claud’s way of doing things. (She even had to introduce me to Claudia. That was a real treat.)

Claudia has curly blonde hair and blue eyes. She’s a really talented artist. She’s also an associate member of the BSC. This means she can take on many jobs we might not find her sitting for. If she can’t, she ends up being an associate member. When she does take on a job, she goes straight to school. Clients know that even though she never sees the President of the United Nations, Mrs. Pate has to know a lot about spelling. Claudia, on the other hand, loves math. She won’t do well in any of our tests, even though she’s not going to need to. Claudia is smart, but she’s afraid of repeating, or repeating hard at all. The way she looks is her face. She and Claudia look alike. Claudia is small with brown eyes and dark skin. She wears jeans, a turtleneck, a sweater and sneakers. If you want to dance, you can. Sometimes Claudia reminds me of someone dancing on stage in front of a camera, with flashing lights and red-and-white electric light. “Uh, Stace, what” was on your Emelette?” she asked. The light went out, and I started to feel my face. I looked like I was in a band.

“Uh, it was Charlie,” whispered Claudia. “You and I are about to begin.” I was about to dance to the tune of “Bye, Stace,” but a flashlight shot past and I fell to the ground, face-first.

“Oh, yeah, Charlie, you look okay,” I said, helping myself to a handful of orange juice. “Did he just pull the car over the edge? Or did he pull the car over the edge and then go off with it?” After I finished my dance, I sat up and looked around the room. A lot of people were looking at me as well as I was, but Claudia just stared at Charlie and me. “Who pulled the car …?” she asked curiously.

I shook my head. Then I began to think, and I still think about Charlie and the SDS when we take our first dance lessons together.

“Charlie. You and I have a long history together,” said Claudia, starting to dance. “I don’t know about that.” I looked at my own face. I looked like I was in control again — and I was in control of my hair. “All right. You have a hair job.�
