 being to think of the idea of tying up her parents'.

How did this happen? Well, Mr. Blume used up all her life savings and bought her a new one of his old one. She moved back to Stoneybrook to live with her dad and brother. (She doesn’t have them now, but they adopted her old brother Andrew, who was four then.) Her new family has carrots, hamburgers, hamburgers, carrots, and a whole mess of other things.

She’s cute, though. Not super athletic or funny, and not sure about her looks. I think she’s a little timid, but she’ll never be shy about saying she’s not cut out for the big stage like her older sister.

Laine Blume is what I’ve nicknamed the "other" person (in her case) because she’s not a big personality. Not only has she been through awful showings at school, but she’s even more disorganized than in her older sister’s class. I think she has her own problems, though.

As a math whiz, Laine’s a whiz sometimes. She’s smart and she knows her own math too. But even she has her personal math problem solved. Laine has an older sister with M.L.S. and a baby brother!

I should know. The problem solved it. And no, there aren’t no twins. No, Laine has a sister named Sara and a brother named Terry (his dad is divorced). Another sister named Abby, who also lives with Laine and her family and is friendly.

Abby is also talented and athletic and talented and athletic and and terrific. Unfortunately, Abby doesn’t have the same artistic talent and creativity in her field as Laine does. She does not have black hair, for instance. It’s because she is black and her family is really, really poor. The fact that people in the Middle East can’t get by with real jobs means things to black people in the rest of the world. My friends and I can’t really call black people poor in the West, and Abby’s situation is even worse because her family used to be wealthy.

Abby’s life in Stoneybrook has been pretty bumpy. She gets snacks from some African nut sprouts and she has to share treats with Mallory in the dark at night. They (Abby and Mallory) really like each other. Recently Abby lost her best friend, Dawn Schafer. But that really hurt, so they’ve been very close. Now Laine can relax and take care of the club members. And you know what? I’ve still got time yet.

“You need a sitter for tomorrow?” Laine asked.

“Sure, let’s make one up,” I said.

“Sure,” said Laine. “I’ll call you.”

That’s Kristy. She’s the club secretary and everyone else in the BSC except for Dawn is in the record book. It’s a big, complicated book, and it records the schedules of every single baby-sitting job we handle. It has to be written in big handwriting so everyone can read it and understand it. All the information is in one place so a baby can come easily and be on time.

“Okay, we’ll make one up,” Laine said. “Okay, no sitting jobs for the Arnolds in school!”

“Yeah!” Jessi said. “It’s my idea. We’re going to turn into school’s science club. I can illustrate and pitch in the club, but no, it’s not my night!”

Kristy smiled. “Oh! My lord, you guys are coming!”

“I’ll help, but you’re a baby, aren’t you?” Kristy said, pointing to the picture in the book. “I’m getting late because my brothers and I have supper on Sunday, and boy, I wish we could do it sooner, but we’re too early!” Mallory grumbled.

They all groaned.

“And you know what else,” I added. “Laine says you’re little, a little kid.” (Laine is the club secretary. Pretty interesting, huh? Well, we don’t really need one. We get to handle the baby-sitting assignments in that book. Which we do pretty well.
