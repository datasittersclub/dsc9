 into my face like the BSC. We have stickers, we have a baseball cap, and we wear makeup and other things. We can't compete with the rest of the BSC members. But we've grown a lot in the past few years, and it's kind of been a good thing that this club has gotten so popular.

The BSC members were our first to join the Boy Scouts. They were so used to us that they started joining us in the club a little later on. We met right away, and since then we've grown and worked together really well as a family. Now our oldest brother, David Michael, is a member of our club too, and we call him Mr. Barrett because he's the oldest guy in our class.

We also have two African-American members, Kristy Thomas (Mary Anne's boyfriend) and Shannon Kilbourne (Jessica Ramsey's adopted sister). You can call Kristy the most beautiful person in the world right now, because she has gray hair and she's a tomboy who wears everything. She's super-trendy. And with her wild style, she's got a lot on her plate.

Kristy is an artist. She's had many projects, but she does her best to keep them under control. Her most recent (and, fortunately, least successful) project is making a stuffed animal. That's something she's very artistic about. She's a brilliant, passionate artist, but she also has some things in common with our other members. First of all, she has a million little steps, which she makes with her two-year-old, Claudia, who's the director. Her mom died when Kristy was small, which is why she's always doing stuff for the little kids she visits. Even though she's so shy and shy, Claudia is really sweet and kind and supportive.

Kristy's a great listener. She even has one of my favorite songs. She sang it to me all the way from California back in seventh grade. "If you can even listen, you are better than me."

Darn, Kristy!

Dawn, who was the first to jump right into the club, fell in love with me and fell deeply in love with Kristy. When Dawn arrived, I was the one who introduced her to everyone. Well, then, the club was born.

Kristy and I lived in Jessi's house for a while, but she fell in love and started our own business. Jessi has two little sisters and a dog — Boo-Boo and Jessica; her boyfriend, Mallory (Jessi's a real junk food nut); her older sister, Tasha, whom she loves (especially carrots); and a baby sister named Watson. And when Kristy and I got into the Baby-sitters Club, we decided to have two more members (Mary Anne and Logan Bruno will be kids).

Mary Anne and Logan are identical twins, but unlike the other members, Mary Anne is a little more outgoing. Mary Anne has curly brownish-brown hair and brown eyes, and she loves sports. She coaches a softball team called Kristy's Krushers.

Kristy’s the club treasurer, and she charges dues every Monday. Since Mary Anne moved to Stoneybrook, she has to be responsible for keeping track of all our expenses: our health insurance, Kristy’s Krushers lessons, and Kid-Kits. We also use our fund to pay Charlie Thomas, who we adopted because he'd turned out to be a really sweet guy. (Kristy and I have been adopted by a good friend of Kristy’s mother.) We also give one of our treasury bills to our treasurer, which includes Kid-Kits, supplies for our summer camp, and an occasional pizza party for our kids.

In some ways, we are the oldest families in Stoneybrook. Mary Anne and me (we’re eleven years old and younger) look like little brothers and sisters. Our housekeeper is pretty nice and I like her as much as Mary Anne. But Mary Anne (yes, she’s the oldest in the family) has a deeper connection to people than most people realize, and I like to blame her for that.

Claud. Mary Anne’s nickname for her was "Claudia." Claud is Japanese-American. She lives in a huge house, but she has more energy and fun than anybody I know. Claud, too, seems to grow up on the fringes of the family, but she’s grown up through everyone's mom — her grandmother, her stepdad's wife, her great-aunt Karen, and her four brothers and sisters. (If they can even remember their names, so can we.) Claud has her own way of dressing. She has tons of fun, and she also likes to be out in the neighborhood — just so Dawn doesn’
