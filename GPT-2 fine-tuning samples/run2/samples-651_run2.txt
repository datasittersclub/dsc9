 in my bedroom. Before I’d moved in with her, she’d lived way across town. Now we have a pretty close animal-sitting club!<|endoftext|>
“You’re sooo cute, honey,” said Stacey McGill, who’s eleven years old and the oldest in her family. “You look so cute too. Just thinking about how old you are.”

“What?” asked me.

“How old is she?” asked Kristy.

“Five-year-old Vanessa. Fifteen-year-old Nicky. Fifteen-year-old Claire. Fifteen-year-old Margo. Well, we’re all here. I’ve got my bike, Mary Anne has her bicycle, I’ll get my valet, I'm going to ride on this, and then you’re done!”

I don’t know how I’d know what I’d done without the good grace of God.

“Great. You’re welcome.” Dawn said. “Mm-hmm. Great, thanks a lot.”

We watched the big green sign flash across the street from our house. The sign said only a handful of people could visit. I felt relieved.” I always feel when something big comes up, the most important people arrive, the way people with hair (don’t ask me — I always prefer curly, dark brown hair) do with welcome guests.

“It’ll surprise me!” Abby suggested.

“It’ll surprise you.” Mary Anne suggested.

“It doesn’t hurt that we have a super-early bird who gets a whole lot of free rides with all the kids he rides with. So I guess she still has plenty of work to do. Even her little brother is nice, huh?”

We laughed. This was cool. Even though we’re all eleven, I can’t ride on my own. I’m all-company.”

“No big deal,” Jessi Ramsey suggested.

“Thanks a lot, Dawn,” Mallory volunteered.

“Thanks, too,” Stacey noted.

“Oh. Well, I mean, let me introduce you. You’re Dawn Schafer, and you know —” (Mary Anne cut in, making contact with her bottom lip) “I’m twenty-one, you know?” (Mary Anne opened her mouth to address the assembled members.)

“Hi, everyone. I’m Jessi Ramsey,” she said. “I’re not even going to try. I’m driving over five hundred people just trying to eat lunch.”

“Gross,” Abby mumbled.

“Hey, that’s a busy week.” Stacey pointed out.

“No. I mean, I don’t mean any of this. I’m just trying to help out Mrs. Schafer.”

“Oh, you guys?” said Abby, leaning over Claudia, who was sitting in the same seat the rest of us were.

“I’m helping yourself,” Stacey said.

“If you’re busy,” Claudia suggested, “you might be able to do one thing for us.” Claudia said that without looking at me.

“Hey, you guys,” I said.

“Hey, I was talking to my mother today. She wants some of those steaks. I think she bought one tonight. Mrs. Ramsey likes steaks, and she wants to raise them here. I’m sure we’d make lots of them.”

“I’d like an apple,” Claudia said, reaching for the cupcake, when the clock switched to 5:30. “It’s a meeting of the BSC.”

We were on our way upstairs, just as the meeting started to turn around.

“Hey, Mrs. Pike said we’d like to come see you and my brother tomorrow afternoon. It’s all good.”

Then Mary Anne came in. She’s in the director’s chair, where she’s always sits. It’s always her turn when she doesn’t come up with a ton of big, boring questions. But sometimes she makes a point of being
