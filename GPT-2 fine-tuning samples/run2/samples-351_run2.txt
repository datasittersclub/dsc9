 anyone with her.”

I felt better. Besides, my life had been more interesting then I’d planned.

The phone rang over and over, almost as if all of us had had a countdown to it.

Kristy answered it and looked at me with an expression that felt like someone was about to kiss her, too.

“Hello?” she asked with a concerned expression.

I answered, just as softly as Kristy would. (Kristy is quiet and shy.)

“Um, hello?” she asked.

I ignored her. I knew Kristy and Abby had been looking through their schedules and discussing what to do next. But I don’t have time for them to grovel that much. After all, we have a job.

“I’ve got two baby-sitting jobs up in Stoneybrook,” Kristy explained.

“Well, you know, I really like you, Abby,” Stacey volunteered.

“I’ve got a new job as an editor with this nice family company on Long Island,” Abby said.

“Oh, no!” I snapped, holding up the brochure.

Abby was floored. “This is really cool! I’m going to become a professional photographer, too. I’m going to try to make all this money.”

Kristy wasn’t interested in becoming an editor. Abby decided her parents would rather take a trip to France than have to watch her mother get patted by paparazzi.

So the conversation was about to move to a meeting of the Baby-sitters Club, which was where I was now.

But I could feel myself drifting out of the meeting. I couldn’t help it. I guess I should get the best of me.

“The club is going to have to call Mary Anne off the bus,” the caller said.

“What kind of assignment?” I asked.

“I hope she’s okay,” Abby replied.

“You’re telling the truth,” the caller said.

“Why don’t you make a list of all our officers and call Mary Anne off the bus, too?”

“Assignments,” Abby replied. “I’ll make it happen. I get the job. I’ll show up for the meeting, find out who to call, and then call Mary Anne off the bus!”

“Can you make it happen!” I cried. “I’m on her! I’m on her!”

The phone rang and I was back in the meeting. Everyone stopped asking questions and just waiting for the meeting to over.

“Okay, everyone!” I said. “I’ll call you right back.”

No response.

“Where were we?” Mary Anne asked. “Is she still there?”

“I’ve had plenty of time with her,” I said. “Is she still a baby? What’s that supposed to mean? No?”

Mary Anne is the youngest member of the Baby-sitters Club. Her mom is the oldest. So that means Mary Anne lives at a very, very different place right now from any of the rest of us.

Maybe that was because I hadn’t been at my meeting that afternoon with my parents. They seem more settled in the city than they used to be (with their condo in Manhattan). And they seemed to be pretty busy.

“Any more business?” Claudia asked.

“Well, my boss is, like, a million different places,” I said.

“Oh, I know,” Mary Anne said. “But wait a minute.”

“Hi, club!” I said. “This is Mary Anne, the club secretary.”

Mary Anne looks like she’s really in charge, not just in terms of the record keeping, but in what she does.

“Mary Anne, can you do some of this sitting?” asked Kristy, after she’d started. “Hey, are we going to have to do this in a minute?”

“Oh, no problem. I should start with the money. And then, like, we could spend some time on something …”

“We’re going to have to put the money toward paying Jenny for
