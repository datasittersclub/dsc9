 room a bowl of pasta with a big sauce pan for the sauce, and then pour myself a dish of noodles and cheese.

I wasn't the only one. If there wasn't some other one, I probably wouldn't have had to wait long. Or I might have moved to BSC because I'm not one to drive or get up late to parties, but as I sit back, there would be no need for any of you to be sitting over me.

When we finally did sit down for dinner, I wanted to set the record straight. That's the reason I'm so excited about having one of my own. I think I have a secret … I had it planned. I couldn't have gone wrong with my idea without you — and the rest of the kids. And I'd like it if you had it better than I did — just by myself and a little with one of my friends.

But wait, there's more. Now we have a baby. It's called Aisha. We have four of us at the moment. So far, all four of us are pretty good friends. We all have a favorite job: running. The best part? Well, we're in charge. We're all at the same table. I like our jobs better. And that doesn't hurt. Anyway, since I'm in charge of a record book, I guess I can look ahead a little.

Oh, well, I could go a little overboard and say that all we have is two little girls, who are very shy and very special about business. And I mean that in a pretty cool way.

"Shaggy-goosey!" I say.

"Yup! You are!" I go on, wiping my face. "You're the baby, then. Why not go in next?"

"Mm-hmm! Then what," I say, rolling down my arms and flogging my legs.

And I think the baby-sitters club might be as awesome as the baby-sitters club.

"Shaggy-goosey!" I repeat.

I look away. Stacey is still giggling, and I look away on my phone:

Stacey Schilling!

"Oh, you have a baby, do you?" she says.

Yeah. She has a baby and a puppy at home. I smile. "I was wondering if you could join for a while." It could have been a lot easier if this would just be a phone call and I knew I wouldn't make a big deal of some kid who's totally in the wrong place at the wrong time.

But here's the rub. Stacey is a very quiet, thoughtful person.

"Oh, you?" I call back.

She flickers her arms and her mouth opens, but it doesn't move. She's giggling.

I guess Stacey would have a better idea if she had told me about her secret to life. Her parents divorced. They both moved to Stoneybrook. They've lived next door to each other since they were babies. We married after their marriage, and we've grown into a very successful family with good-natured, very successful people. But we now live separate lives in Stoneybrook from her. And though Stacey lives a whole lot like a baby, she and I both know the best way to talk about our lives is by getting her used to us. That means I have to tell the kids that sometimes she's really mean — and we're not talking about it lightly.

Stacell, you might recall me, is the first American girl to enter the Baby-Sitters Club. She's also the first child adopted after my baby-sitters club meeting. She also has to admit to being a little shy. She thinks a lot of different things than the rest of us; she even has a really good boyfriend (who can wait to have an even girlfriend) who's also adopted. She's cute; outgoing (and not afraid of being a little weird) and funny. But even though she's so shy, I think her mom is so sensitive about her. I mean, the only problem is that her dad is a big fan of the baby-sitters club, which, of course, is not a big deal to her.

In order to see this baby-sitters club together, you have to know how sensitive Mrs. Schiller is to sensitive kids. For example, I have to admit, Stacey's mom has a very big crush on our little sister, Vanessa. (Stacey, we say, is the baby-sitter club's newest member, after the club. She's not sure she'll be a good choice for the BSC, but she sure does like Vanessa.) You can bet her heart she isn't one of the shyest kids around. Of course, she's not a
