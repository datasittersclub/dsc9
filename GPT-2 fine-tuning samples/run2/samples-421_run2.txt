 as the only two members of a BSC), and Kristy, Abby, and Stacey.

“Hi, it’s me,” Jessi said as she took Nick in her arms, her blonde hair flying back and forth. “Where have you been? Where?”

“Oh, well. My father’s in Connecticut!” I told her. “I guess it’s a dream, because all I’m doing now is running around town.”

“You’re just as fast as I was and as efficient as anybody else!” Jessi said. “What if you didn’t know? What if I’d taken the day job and turned into a pretzel?”

“What would that have been like?” I managed to say.

“I know. But I don’t know what it would have meant.”

“How would you know?”

Maybe I would. Maybe I would. Maybe Kristy would have the answer.

“What if I lost my bike?” asked Stacey.

“Who would have lost their bike?”

“I don’t know.”

“If you want a clue,” said Kristy, “this is the worst car wreck ever. I mean, really. I don’t know if you can imagine.”

“I’m a teacher and I’m going to be …” said Stacey, reaching out to stroke her pencil.

“Help!”

“Help!” Kristy shouted. “I’m being taken. I am taking my bike. See? I’m taking it with me. It is my only class of the day.”

I knew Kristy was talking about me, but I couldn’t tell who was really mad. It’d be like seeing the last of my friends. Kristy, which one of you wants to be a star ballerina?

Luckily, the others were convinced me at the time. Kristy has a flair for dramatic effect. She is an idea leader — her words are always moving and exciting. Her family has always been bold, but now her father is a star. She’s also smart, but she wants her parents to think of her as a baby (it’s a great idea, though).

Kristy’s family may have been bold, but now her stepfather is a millionaire. He doesn’t live in a mansion. She has an adopted younger sister, who’s from Vietnam, and a son. She lives with her mom, brother, father, and Watson (his dog, a Bernese mountain dog, named after Kristy). The Watson kids are all short and brown and, if the kids aren’t tall, Kristy knows they’re too young for her. Her stepfather is a millionaire too, so she gets to be the vice-president of the world.

What does Kristy do well, besides take her meetings to meetings, visit her best friend Mary Anne, and give her her honorary degrees? She makes up junk food for a living. When the money is coming in, she stashes it somewhere — on her bed and in her drawers or in her drawers in the books and in her drawers in her drawers in the glasses and in her glasses in her bedroom or in the pillows in the linen rooms.

When her stepsister, Mary Anne, decided she liked horses and had put one in her blood, Kristy asked her parents to replace the horse in the blood with an authentic horse from the movies. Her ancestors used to live near the Kishis. And before they left for California, her grandmother lived nearby. I’ve already told you about Mary Anne’s family. Now you know about Kristy’s!

The BSC is also very interesting, since we have seven regular members (three associate and three permanent) and seven vice-president (including two associate). Seven vice-president (that’s a big word; we count six regular members, plus one vice-president who doesn’t attend meetings every week). We meet three times a week, since it’s a family business. During lunch, we’re overflow seats for parents who need an extra seat for their children. During club meetings, we’re running phone meetings. When there’s a problem, we solve it. No one ever says, “We solved it!” (No one could agree with that; Kristy’s father was a genius.)
