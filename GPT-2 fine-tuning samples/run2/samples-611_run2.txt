oporyd. It was nice to have her back."

"And her best friend, Dawn Schafer," added Stacey.

"That she'll never get used to her," Sharon remarked. "The rest of us are probably going to be downright creeped out by her. But she's the only one who likes kids, and she's totally addicted to them."

Maria nodded. "I'm just surprised that a grown-up like her is going to let a kid go on a vacation."

"I'm not, either," Kristy said. "It's just her habit. She's always kind and caring and funny and understanding and caring."

"Dawn is a bit of a wild girl," Abby remarked.

"I suppose. The rest of her friends are too," Kristy admitted. "She seems happier sometimes than usual these days."

Abby turned to me. "Hey, Claudia, it's only fair that way."

"I can't live without Dawn if I'm to ever need her," I said. "And I think it would be better to live with Dawn now."

"It would be better," Abby said. "And not to mention let Dawn go and become her own person again."

"Like the rest of us?" asked Stacey.

"Well, we'll find out in a day. But I think it's all worth it, I think."

"If Dawn does decide to go away," Kristy went on, "it will have a very, very bad, awful, horrible, lasting effect on our family. And I don't think Stace or anyone will want to live with it."

It wasn't just Stace who wanted to live in California. Stacey had arrived. She's the treasurer of the BSC and, as club president, she's responsible for collecting dues every Monday. (We use the money to pay for things like our day-to-day expenses.)

Stace's family lived in Stoneybrook for almost as long as Abby's. In fact, the BSC originally set up the family in Stoneybrook. In fact, we were just looking out of the window when we first moved into this old farmhouse and it seemed like the only sensible thing for Stace to do before moving. We're still haunted by her family's first love at this time.

Stace's dad was killed in a car crash when she was nine years old. Just like her mom, Abby and Stace are very sad about her passing, but they haven't given up hope on their daughter. Stacey and her younger brother, Jeff, live with their mom in the farmhouse. They just moved into the farmhouse because the BSC was built for work. (Our main office space is in Jeff's room, the way it was in Stoneybrook.) It's hard to imagine the house being so rundown and messy, with only a few rugs, a closet, and a dresser in the barn. The inside of the farmhouse is also much nicer, with a bed, linen table, and a barn that once stood over it.

In addition to Stace and Abby, there are Emily Michelle (yes, her real name is Nannie) and Nannie, one of our other members. They're just another two people we have on the team. They're our backups and we don't need everyone.

Meanwhile, Shannon and Boo continue to fill in as alternate officers, which means they take up any extra sitting duties we have left over.

For those who don't know, we're all associate members. That means we don't have to come to meetings but only sit if a job comes up, or if a club call comes in and no one is available. We are also good baby-sitters, which is a good thing â€” we know that sometimes our brains get in the way of other kids' good ideas.

At this point, you probably already know the members of our club. The title belongs to Charlotte Johanssen. The BSC record book is where we keep the club's official schedules. The club record book was the one we established as an independent agency, while also keeping our club notebooks.

In case you're wondering, there are eleven regular members, six of whom are associate members. They don't come to meetings, since they're not required to attend. They are all excellent baby-sitters, especially Boo, who isn't much of a person until she's in the sixth grade.

Besides regular members, there are Claudia, Stacey, Claudia's mother, and Stacey's father, who are all animals. I'm really excited about seeing Claudia again. They used to live in Connecticut, but the Stevensons moved to New York City when her parents divorced. Claudia misses New York terribly, which is why she's been there so much. She's been an
