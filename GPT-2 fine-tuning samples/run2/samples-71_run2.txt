 about how much they hate the idea of spending the last six years alone on a baby-sitting job; how they really hate the idea of spending the last six years together as a mother. It sounds like a lot of work.

It's sort of not an easy time to be a parent. But I have the greatest sense of humor, or at least my best sense of humor, and at least a million hours in the world, of all parents who find out they have to come to a meeting each day.

Well, Kristy was pretty strict about it for awhile, and the meetings started very early in the summer, when I had a couple of weeks on the job. She told us she wanted to be a full time parent for the rest of us.

I thought of being a full time parent, but Kristy told me I'd be free to go back to school. She agreed. Then Kristy invited me back to her house and told me I should do my homework. That's how the summer ended. Kristy and I were practically married.

My parents are divorced. I'm married now.

Kristy and I are both thirteen. That's what I call an adopted family. If it doesn't work out for you, then you can come back whenever you want. But, if the situation sounds like you know how to make things that way, then you may want to look it up, if not, we'd love it if you could do something like that.

I don't know anyone with perfect English. I was born in the English language department. But I learn new languages and I get my hands dirty. Sometimes it's hard because in the first grade, I don't have the right vocabulary for the language I'm studying (which wasn't too hard, as I was the only student in that class). But then things improve as I get older, and all of a sudden I can even write for the English-language magazine I'm studying in. Just about everything I read, except for a few in the BSC. (This is important.)

My mother died when I was a baby and my dad was at the age of thirteen when my mom's parents split up. But it was okay. He still lived with his grandmother, who still lives in California. She was still a total baby-sitter. That really helped. I think that in the end everything worked out for me and the rest of the Scholades.

So, I have three steps to the family business (my other two are BSC members and Kristy at the moment).

Step 1: Find a reliable and reliable man whom people like. This is a huge business if you know who, and how your kids are supposed to act. Kristy calls it the club. She's the president. I call it the associate members.

Step 2: Find someone who is ready to work on something (I've just said my name again and again). It'll be hard work, but you can get it. I'm a little on the easy side, since Kristy and I can't live without a steady clientele. But I'm not really a total junk food or anything. We're just people who like being in charge of something.

Step 3: Find someone who will be your alternate secretary. That's the club you have for all of us. Then you can form the alternate.

Step 4: What is alternate duty? It's the oldest part of the job, and it was important to Kristy. I'm the secretary with the most days (every other part of the time). But we all have lots of other duties, such as the writing, the scheduling, and the checking in of all of our dues.

I know my boss, Charlie Ramsey, and he's right across town. I guess he would be much more comfortable with my job than some of my friends on the street.

If the next steps didn't work out for you, or if something didn't work out for you, just leave a comment with your favorite and maybe someone else's would be happy to help.

It all comes down to the right situation and the right job. If you can't do that, don't complain. But if you're sure something has gone badly wrong, you can contact the Scholades.

Nowadays, I write about my new friends on the Scholades. We usually have one sitting job, but we can sit all the time if we need somewhere to sit for a whole new group of two kids.

In the old days, when Mary Anne Spier lived by herself and Charlie, we had to go through the regular meetings and do the club jobs. I think that's because Mary Anne's family doesn't mind working at any other job. Sometimes she just likes being part of the club. But she and her mother lived on the edge of town. They were too busy living with Charlie and
