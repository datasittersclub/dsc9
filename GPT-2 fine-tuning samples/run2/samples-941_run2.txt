 to have some fun. (I was having so much fun, in fact, that I ended up leaving for California, where I was living for Thanksgiving.)

Kristy and Mary Anne didn't look alike. They are very different. Mary Anne has red hair, freckles, and glasses. She's a truly individualist person. Kristy is a loudmouth and not interested in being heard. She does belong to a very big family, and she has a small family.

"Hey!" I said, making a face. "Here I am!"

"Not quite, exactly, but still standing."

That prompted another laugh. "Sorry, Kristy."

"Well, let's see — is there anything more we can do to help?"

"Maybe," I said, but it was still a smile.

" Kristy, would you like some additional business?"

I pulled a manila envelope from under the couch.

" May I have your attention."

" Business as usual," I said.

"Now, this is Mrs. Schafer. Please look at this," said Kristy, returning the envelope to me. "This is from Mr. Spier. This is Mrs. Schafer. Yes, it is very well done, thanks," she said. "May I please give her this good-by?"

I put my napkin back under the bed and carefully opened it. It was the beginning of a new chapter in my story.

"We'll monitor this carefully," Kristy said. "After that, this is where we write records."

I grinned. "Did you write that down already?"

" Yes, in my napkin," said Kristy.

" So be it. I'm sure you're, um — writing down some of those big s—t-less, naughty-but-good-I'll-come-back-after-you-that-is. I'm keeping track of my own life as I go along. "

I looked at the envelope for a second, then at Kristy, who was moving toward the door. Snap!

"Buddy," I shouted, knocking the other two on my heels. "He's already taken off. Pay attention, look at the top three pages of our reportcard. Then, once you've studied the pages, you can tell who's in the red shirt."

Buddy Brewer and Alan Gray jumped up.

"Hey!" I said. "What? Who wants a red shirt?"

"I said, we'll compare and contrast this shirt to a red hot red hot hot shirt. And —"

"Do we want to play ball?" I asked. "This is really going to be a red hot affair? Are the police here some kind of money ruse?"

"Definitely. The police are on our way. And I'm sure they'll be rounding on us as we cross this bridge."

"Thanks. I appreciate it. Just keep it down here."

"Go for it, girl." I jumped when she replied.

"Don't do it at my expense," said Kristy, who had climbed the ladder to the highest building in the whole school.

"I could try," I said as I hurried to the other side. "Did she call the BSC secretary, Mary Anne? I wouldn't want to ruin my day by stepping on her trays."

Mary Anne Spier, Kristy's boss, didn't look impressed.

"I appreciate it enormously," he said quickly. "Go for it. Do it for the good of the BSC or for the good of Kristy's own little school."

"Go for it, too, Kristy," echoed the rest of her.

I would.

Kristy wasn't looking forward to anything. After all, as my Highness existed outside of any kind of form of official agency, no agency existed outside of the BSC. I needed something to keep me posted on what was going on with our clients. To my surprise, though, the BSC seemed to belong in the BSC. I needed to know more about them, and I had plenty of business to try them.

I found out what needed doing and how. Over the course of a week, the club was able to plan and produce something totally different: a dinner for the Kid-Kits, a play group for the entire family, and a special holiday dinner.

Everything went from black to white in the club's direction. It was a good business, really. The BSC is an umbrella organization for parents to communicate about their kids' lives — parties, contests, art projects, activities, stores ... I mean, a big party. Why are parents so successful when other people are so miserable? Why do so many people
