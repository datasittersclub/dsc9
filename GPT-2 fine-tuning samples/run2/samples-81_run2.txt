 smaller things out, which made me happy that Friday. Plus, it had been fun, considering it hadn't been my usual job, so I wouldn't necessarily run out to dinner or to my boss' house to watch a movie. Plus, it seemed like fun, in that way.

"I love you guys, Kristy," I said as I made my way into the basement. "You guys are awesome."

"Really?" asked Stacey, her head spinning as she began to speak.

"I love you guys," I answered.

"So does Stacey." (This was probably the closest I'd come to answering the question because this wasn't a bad answer. She did sound pretty happy.) "You mean I'm a bad boyfriend?"

Stacey was giggling.

"Yeah! Well, I am, I mean. I am a great boyfriend," I said, looking at my clothes.

"Oh, okay. Oh. And not a bad boyfriend. Okay, okay. And not the worst boyfriend. I wouldn't want to go out with you and baby sister Claudia again, unless you're the best boyfriend in the world — okay. But I'm the best boyfriend and then you're pretty!"

"Right, Right," commented Abby, her cheeks reddening. "But I am a really good boyfriend, and I love the fact that you like Claudia — and that you just keep going. That's the truth."

"I guess I love Claudia," I said, looking out the window from my bedroom window to the basement. "But I guess I'm not the best boyfriend."

"Great news? But I'm not like the bad guys," answered Janine. When Abby saw me this morning, she cried. "I mean, Claudia, isn't it amazing you love me as much?"

The conversation quickly turned to her.

"So, you see, I love and love Claudia, and I think Claudia can only be so much better with you guys than with me. And I think you guys like Claudia."

"Well, I love and love Claudia, but now I think I'm going to be really jealous of you."

I nodded.

We settled into Stacey's bed with a long silent look in my eyes, and we settled inside (as usual) the basement. We sat with one of Kristy's brothers, Jeff, for about an hour — a long stretch at a time over the weekend — trying to make sense of what was and wasn't going on in Kristy's room.

One thing about Kristy is that she acts just like you do. The way she paints her clothes and her voice. She never stops smiling, or pretends she can, like all the people we're talking to here. She makes you think she's just a writer or secretary or whatever like the rest of us. She's so different from you.

Kristy is a New Yorker, a natural-born natural-born human being with dark brown hair and a big sister named Anna. And she's pretty. She's Japanese-American, very Japanese-American, and has a pretty serious family right here in New York City. (Her parents, who live in Long Island, are in the process of moving back to Victoria, New York in order to make sure Kristy doesn't move back to New York that much.) The rest of us, I think, look pretty great, too. We like to dress, we like sports, and we like to have a party. (This is because Kristy's parents are jealous of Kristy's sister, who has to go out with her grandparents to get to know them. That can always be an issue for any new family.)

Kristy's parents are very strict about her. Kristy's dad is a total monster. He is not good enough for any boy, and he never has anyone younger than his age to take care of him. When he takes care of Kristy, Kristy's family gets worse. Kristy, for one thing, is very much against her parents and the strictness there is. Kristy's parents feel like they have to do it for their baby, but I think Kristy would never do it. She's just kind of afraid of her mom anyway, she's too immature to deal with things (especially school issues).

And she's so young, in fact, that she looks exactly like Kristy in one particular look. And she has pale skin, with freckles on a pale color pale-brown, with dark freckles. She has short arms and an extremely athletic form. She's also a little shy about her clothes, but she's still soft (like Kristy).

Kristy's parents are very strict about her. They have to give her braces to walk around, to sit in front of a television set, and to help her sit in a quiet room
