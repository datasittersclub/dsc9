======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 For things I know, I was a fan of Mallory (I was), but I didn't know her very well until I got to know Mal. Then, as you probably know already, my family moved into Watson’s old house. (Kristy and I share a house, by the way, that is pretty far away.) Anyway, when I got to know Mal, I was stunned. She’s a fabulous ballerina. She takes lessons in Stamford, and she works with a whole different kind of company (Claudia’s dad is a ballerina himself!) It wasn’t that surprising that we became friends, because we both have very different interests, but we got to know each other pretty well as we worked together as a family.

Mal is our club secretary and I’m responsible for making sure we have a neat, fresh lunch schedule. (I love scheduling baby-sitting jobs. In the morning I bring a box of Milk Duds to sit for a group of little kids who are in kindergarten, or a cardboard carton to take baby-sitting assignments.) I keep a record book in which we have entries, including client names and addresses, rates paid, and any important information about the children. (In my heart, it says “Order, please, Madame President,” but it takes some doing to make it really organized.) As secretary, Mal has no fewer than six personal duties:

1. Keep an eye on every baby-sitting appointment. When a client requests a sitter, she has to know the time, number, and date. Her record book records everything we do at the house, including our baby-sitting jobs.

2. Plan our activities. Kristy wants us to have organized, so we have lots to do during the week. Plus, during the weekends we hang out, eat together, and do things like We ♥ Kids Club. (Boy, does that sound fun.)

3. Know when to call the club, set up phone lines, and coordinate jobs among ourselves. (I don’t know where that office sits; we probably use it at other offices.)

At any given moment, we have somewhere between seven and ten people; in our case, it’s probably two. Kristy always looks out for the quality of her staff, since there are so many different kinds of baby-sitting jobs. Kristy is organized, too: in handy, since she is the club president.

Mary Anne Spier is my best friend. She goes to Stoneybrook Day School, like I go to — if there’s anyone left in the school gym. Mary Anne can’t be bossy. (I like to think of Mary Anne as the most immature member of the club, and I’m the shyest.) I think she’s the opposite of scheming. She’s very sensitive and will anywhere and whenever. She’s part of the genius/math community, so she is lucky. (I think her idea of a great accessory is a school ballerina.)

If you thought Kristy’s mom was really strict, stop! It’s true. It was almost as if she grew up without a dad. Not only because of the tests, but because she had to raise (and maintain) a younger version of herself after her father died. What was really remarkable about the family dynamic is that everything was put on hold until Dawn moved back to California. And when she came back, she was so devastated that she even threw herself into high school. Not that she was trying hard enough. It just wasn’t worth it. For one thing, the move was difficult and incredibly difficult, both for Dawn and her family. For another, even though Dawn and her younger brother Jeff were pretty far away, they were so close by that I could almost feel my father was away. So it was not the only difficult decision for them. (Once, a while it felt as if we were watching a ghost movie.) For other people, such as Dawn, it was very scary.

The BSC has two younger members, Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike. Mal and Jessi are junior officers, and they’re eleven years old (the rest of us are thirteen) and in sixth grade. They are also best friends, and best friends because they are identical twins. Unlike most siblings, they have very different names (Mal and me both hate the oldest one, so “Let” set that aside.) Mallory’s real passion is writing and drawing, while Mal’s devoted to studying and coming up with great ideas. This is a really strong bond, and they both are the oldest among their siblings.

Okay, back to business. The BSC meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, after school. We use
