======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 to do things on Mondays, which we call club meetings. In fact, after Mr. Cummings moved out of Stamford — and Mrs. Stacey did drop off the Baby-sitters Club — we needed sitters. How do we arrange the jobs in our houses? Simple — just say one person, call one number and get an even bigger job, and keep the same amount of people.

Okay. I'm off. I get a little worried when I hear the word "sit." I don't blame her. I know Kristy doesn't like me to feel guilty. I know that feeling is mutual. But there are times when you have to feel guilty.

Kristy's full of it. (And this is saying something; she was hoping I'd told you all I know.)

It hasn't been easy in the lot. But I think it's been worth it. Even now, I can see how Kristy's family could grow.

Kristy's family is not only complicated, it's pretty. Kristy's mom has three brothers, Charlie (seven), Sam (seven), and David Michael (ten-year-old brother). She also has a stepmother, Sharon; a stepfather, Watson; and a stepsister! Plus, her father is divorced, and Sharon has two kids — Karen, who's eight, and Andrew, who's seven.

If Kristy, Watson, and Kristy's mom became perfect, they'd throw Kristy under a bus and take her back to our household, just like a famous fashion designer did after the wedding.

Kristy's mom is a total take-charge. She'll crank out whatever commandment is left in the book. She's very sensitive, and laid back. Plus, in a big, strong household, she'll tolerate almost anything. She has a mind of her own, too.

So would my father, in fact, be Kristy's mind at SMS? I think so. (Kristy's father just left, obviously. The Junk Bucket has only one half hour to spare before we meet in Claudia Kishi's room.)

"I think we do," agreed Kristy. "I think what we're trying to do is get together and have a good time. That's what I love about Stoneybrook. I think it has to be a good time."

I felt that way just thinking about Stoneybrook was enough to make me want to gag, but I knew that wouldn't last. And even if it did, I'd have to say that it was a good thing for Stacey to be together with her father. You see, my mother and Kristy's mother had gotten married just like nearly every other old family in California. (See, the woman in the photo above, Dawn Schafer? Had just gotten married!) And Mr. Spier and Ms. Schafer had gone through so much change that the Bradford Court they lived in seemed like home before Kristy's parents remarried. (Kristy's mother remarried too, to this neat guy named Watson Brewer.)

Still, Kristy wouldn't say that it wasn't a good thing for Kristy's mother and her three brothers in particular. Well, maybe it was because she'd grown up in a big, noisy house, and now her parents were divorced? I had no idea. But if Kristy's parents had grown up too fast, maybe she'd have married someone other than her mother, and the Thomases might end up with a pretty rotten family.

Kristy's father had already left when Kristy was really young, when his company transferred him here. And now their home was split across two states — Kristy's father was gone for good — and four people — me, my brothers, Karen and Andrew, and four women — Dawn, Claudia, Mary Anne, and me. One of them, Dawn, had moved here in the middle of the night after I'd gone to college, in the town where my father used to live. So she went back to live with the Brewer/Schafer house (which was probably where she'd grown up). (When Dawn got her hair cut, for example, the whole thing went downhill, but she's managed to turn it into hair, despite the fact that she and her mother love each other.) Dawn's mother had once lived with me and the Brewer/Schafer family, but she's long since left. I guess it's because her new family is even bigger now.

I could never understand how some people could have so much trouble. But sometimes you just have to help one another,” Kristy said as she looked up at me.

There’s nothing like it when this happens.

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat. I can always count on Dawn for help — and always will. I tried to think of a solution.

I thought one way would be for
