! And we were not the last to arrive. The car pulled away from Palo City Airport and into the distance. Our house was packed. Sunny used to live in the house next door, but now she had to move out of the way to survive.

Sunny used to live across the street from my house, next to Jessica Ramsey. Sunny used to be the oldest kid in our family, but now she's older than Dawn, Kristy Thomas, and Mallory. She has chocolate-brown skin and dark eyes, and she's tall and graceful. She's pretty, with cream-colored skin and white as the lightest tint in the entire universe.

Today we were sitting at the Rodowskys' house, with Sunny, Jessi, and Josh sitting in the director's chair. Jessi is a talented ballerina. She takes lessons every other week and practices every day. She has thick, curly blonde hair (usually pulled back in a bun) and she's a real knockout. She moves fast, too. In fact, she's one of the best athletes I've ever seen. She even studies ballet.

The next house we were in wasn't from Sunny. It was a little mansion on Bradford Court, across town from the famous Pikes'. Jessi and Mal are best friends, but they're also just a couple in this crazy group of people they run. Jessi is a very talented ballerina who looks just like Jessi, but she has real, shiny skin and beautiful dark skin. She also wears glasses and braces (which she hates because they make her brown skin look gross). She wants to be a writer when she grows up.

We were on our own when Jessi was put on the Long Island slumber party. We were too busy playing video games and having parties for our charges to bother. That's because Jessi's family only lives in the house, which is integrated — because the family is integrated! The rest of the members are part of the Long Island chapter of the Pikes, the only ones who don't belong to the BPI.

Like Jessi, Jessi is the oldest kid in her family. She has seven brothers and sisters! She also has two younger sisters, Becca and Gai. Then there's Mallory, who's seriously cute with a red hair cut at the cut-line and who's totally accident-free. She has pigtails, pierced ears, funny eyes, and a knack for makeup — both things that the BPL likes.

Mallory’s parents got divorced two years ago and her father still lives in New York City. But Mallory keeps her cool as far as her looks go. She’s the most fashionable dresser in her class at Stoneybrook Middle School.

Mallory and Jessi are also best friends. They share a taste for trendy clothing (like I’m sharing about Nyquil and Yiddish today) and are both great friends (like me). But Jessi is the shortest girl in the eighth grade, and she wears trendy clothes but doesn’t care much about trendy-colored china or jeans. She’s totally cool about her looks. Jessi is one of the best ballet dancers I’ve ever seen. She takes lessons as often as the rest of us.

Jessi and Mal are each the oldest kids in their family. Jessi has seven siblings, including half a litter! She’s small and light, with curly blonde hair that tans but doesn’t go on forever. Jessi has a mom, father, and younger brothers. She’s a real take-charge kind of person, almost like Pete, although Jessi’s style of being a loudmouth is more casual.

The Pikes have a dog, a cat, and a dog-friendly dog-friendly cat. Unfortunately, Misty, Jessi’s friend and my friend, has to turn her down.

You may be wondering what Dawn's stepsister and stepbrother, John Philip Hayes, was. We thought we’d never meet again. We’d be thrilled to have reunites with Mr. and Mrs. Winslow, who are also Matthew and Carrie and Andrew Marshall, the couple we used to baby-sit for. But Dawn says she didn’t feel she had had enough of them. Dawn says she wanted to move back to California with her father after she and her brother Jeff (who had returned to California) were born in California. I have to admit that after living here for so long I did feel a little guilty for marrying someone the Petersons disapproved of, but I knew what had really happened.

During the summer after our wedding, a new girl, Dawn’s sister, Anastasia, had appeared in California. She’d been an associate BSC member, which meant
