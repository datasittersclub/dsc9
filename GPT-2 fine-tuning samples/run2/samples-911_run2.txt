 we can take their kids on trips, too. We also use alternate members to fill in when we're swamped with jobs. Some of the girls I've talked to don't have their private school names carved onto their chests, but they always look decent.

Now, with so many regular members, how can we meet? That's the main thing. Meetings are held in Claudia's room, and parents can call anytime. We always keep up-to-date with our charges at home. We also keep up-to-date on their families — their kids' birthdays, their kids' vacations, their pets. We also keep up-to-date with their house, too. In fact, we were elected president when she lived in the SDS (when her dad took over).

I'll start with a brief description of the BSC and the family. We keep them very much together. Mrs. Thomas works hard, and we have a lot in common. We are all family-minded. We pride ourselves on having things we love, and we're always up-to-date on the latest trends in house-cleaning and diet-monitoring. We also know how important each member of the BSC (and our families, too) is to the club.

I promised I'd fill you in on the various members, so here goes. First of all, each of the girls has a special talent or interests that really interest her. She does both dance and drama. She plans and acts about her beloved family — step-siblings, parents, a kitten nicknamed Tigger, a baby-sitter named Mallory Pike, a pet dog named Boo-Boo, assorted other passions. She also dreams up fun activities for the kids. One of her hobbies is sports. That's the best thing about being a coach for a struggling child, and it's the thing the BSC has been great at for ages. In fact, in the BSC — as opposed to most of us regular members — there's no such thing as the quiet kid. He's usually the one who answers the phone when someone calls, takes an interest, or comes in for a sitter.

The second member to gain entrance to my brain matter is Mal. She's our alternate officer. Unlike the regular officers, she can fill in for any of the absent officers. Now, I can't pretend I'm good with children. Being an expert at remembering people's faces and handwriting is. well, it's certainly a plus. But there's some serious math involved in knowing who's where on a day-to-day basis. And knowing who's free on a night-to-night basis doesn't always happen.

For example, Jessi and Mallory can't sit together on Wednesday and Friday afternoons at all. (Why? Because they're sitters themselves.) Neither can they if they're away from home. (I'd have to go home and shower and pack a suitably heavy bed, since neither is allowed to skimp on club functions.) That leaves only Dawn, who takes all afternoon sitting jobs. Plus she'll be working with a foreign boy (we didn't see him in the meeting), with a strange name (Dawn wanted to be an orthodontist and would like to do that kind of thing, but coach never made it easy on her), with an equally strange (Lindsey told us so) personality (I think Jessi refers to Kristy in the BSC notebook), and then with Mal's baby brother, Squirt. We'd all like to spend some time in Squirt's tomb, but Mal had trouble keeping up with her sports routine.

Speaking of Squirt, I should mention that he's really, really cute. We adore hearing his favorite sport, and we think he has the perfect personality for it. He reminds us of Squirt almost constantly, and sometimes we can tell when he's on his way to a meeting or something. He even wears his nose cutters on his fingers sometimes!

The BSC vice-president is Claudia, of course. She's the only member of the club who doesn't go to the movies. And as I mentioned, her phone line is at every meeting. That means she keeps Mary Anne's junk food — Ring-Dings, Tootsie Pops, pretzels, Hershey's Kisses — hidden around our sandwiches, salads, and on awnings. The snacks are low-calorie, healthy, and yucky.

Not every BSC member comes straight from school. You see, our meeting place was Kristy Thomas's great idea, and hers was a little out of step with the rest of Kristy's idea. Kristy's idea was what we call the Baby-sitters Club ...

A baby-sitting idea. Here's what Kristy's idea was ...

A club to meet on Monday afternoons from five-th
