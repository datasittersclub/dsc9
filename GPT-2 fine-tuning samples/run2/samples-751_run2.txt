 would be fine. She doesn't want me to go to a dance class again, but it still isn't the same as my ballet classes. If I sit for the Ramseys, or perform at a sleepover, there certainly are lots of jobs we can take. That's why Kristy was so busy as president and the club treasurer. She's as busy as anybody else professionally, and it's not surprising. She's also a good editor, good at spotting interesting ideas in people's lives and then working them out with them to come up with more great ideas. She has lots of experience managing people — baby-sitting, publishing, baby-sitting for kids — and she sees how they fit in with her own lives and with the world around them. One of the reasons Kristy grew up this way is that her mom died when Kristy was a baby, and there's nothing left over from that, so Kristy's mom lives over all her old life. She was a caring, kind, caring mother, and Kristy knows that. She's still a little sad about what happened.

For a while at least, Kristy's mom was the chief boxkeeper. She checked outfits out of people's hats and left boxes labeled T minus S, plus one for each artist, writer and children's book author. Then she stashed her stuff all over her room, and she was just about to open up some drawers in case someone were ever murdered. Her grandmother, Nannie, lived with her family, too, but Nannie was no longer just a grandmother. She was an incredibly generous member of society. In fact, Nannie was willing to have Kristy's old car plop the front yard again.

"The only people I ask about are you guys," Kristy said to Mary Anne, who was in the director's chair. "If we could just drive a girl wild and drive her wild all year, we'd just pass those monuments to your ancestors."

"The monuments to your ancestors?" Abby asked her mother as she adjusted her seat belt. "You know, the ones where the White House and Capitol building are two monuments to your ancestors?"

Mary Anne nodded to Mary Anne, who had just sat down on the bed with Mary Anne and the other two, Kristy and Jessi, when the announcement rang the shots. As soon as Jamie told everybody the news, everyone started laughing. It was great! And it was true. The “Great American Sports Park” has been an excellent part of the Connecticut professional sports experience for many years.

Since then, there’ve been some rough patches, but the positive and the negative have been very positive for Kristy, too.

I think the biggest positive of the year has to be the announcement of our associate members! Abby Stevenson, Mary Anne’s neighbor, is our newest associate member. She joined the BSC not too long ago, and as I mentioned, although she’s only a minute long, she’s a lot shorter than Kristy.

So now we’re in business.

I never know where the next meeting will take me. But I feel certain that it’s somewhere in the middle of my brain. The day was never about meeting. Every day that passes, I fill in my calendar and guess where I’d be when Kristy called it a snap.

“We could start the meeting now, Kristy,” I announced, but I didn’t schedule a meeting in advance. I knew it would just feel good to wait and see what would come next. I knew the BSC needed all its members, and I knew we’d have to start a club to help solve our problems now and in the future.

Most of us were pretty happy to be sitting at Claudia’s, though. Our clients sometimes asked if we could help them find a new business to take their kids to a new neighborhood. We were glad to be able to do it.

I glanced at my watch. It was almost five-fifteen yet I was almost at the BSC’s BSC headquarters, across town from Claudia. For one thing, the time was still four minutes. We were just getting started — and there was one more meeting scheduled for three and a half weeks from now.

“Can I have a cookie? I need one today,” Kristy insisted.

That made me feel good. I could look this cool today.

I opened my bag of Cheez Doodles and bought six, evening. I put one in my mouth and another on the floor.

“Hey, Claudia, how was your meeting today?” Mary Anne asked as she looked at the clock.

“Great,” I answered quickly. “I will call you next.
