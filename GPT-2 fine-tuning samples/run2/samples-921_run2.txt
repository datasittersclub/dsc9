 with it.” And when she asked, “Are you feeling all right?”

I was feeling really cranky. I had a heartworm check, and a fever check, and an asthma check to make sure nothing was lung-damaging or deep, too. I felt so warm inside.<|endoftext|>
“Hi, you guys,” I said as I ran up the stairs to Claudia’s room. “Of course. I was thinking about being a little late to go to the Rodowsky’s for Christmas.”

“Late?” said Mallory.

“I was thinking about doing something fun, like hanging out with the kids.”

“Maybe having a football practice, like last week?” I asked.

Mallory shrugged. “I guess I’m going to stay up all night and watch football. If I go to sleep, Dad’s going to let me go straight home.”

“Stacey and I are going to have to go to a practice —”

“A football practice?” Abby said.

“Yeah!” I said.

Abby shrugged. “I don’t want to participate in that. I mean, I don’t want to watch any football games, but I don’t want to watch Stacey’s practice. I want to watch Claudia practice.”

“That’s good,” I said.

“Good,” said Abby.

I sat there, thinking for a moment. I know Abby would have a practice if she had to watch every single football game. And Stacey would have practice, too, if she weren’t sick.

“No worries,” I said. “Just one thing. I’m getting crabby about Stacey’s homework.”

“It’s not so bad,” said Abby. “I just had some bad news.”

“What?'s bad?” I asked. “What bad news is bad?”

“Nothing bad,” said Mallory. “Just what I wanted: homework and summer.”

“I don’t want summer?” I said. “You are part of the summer program.”

“But …”

Abby leaned toward me. “What — you mean, you don’t want homework and summer?”

“Yes,” I replied. “We always have it on Thursdays. And we also do some summer stuff, too.”

“I wonder,” Mallory said, “If you were to pack a school bus with our kids, which ones could you expect to meet?”

“Me, at least,” said Jessi.

“Me, at least,” said Stacey.

“It’s Monday,” I said. “I have some business.”

“I’ll get to know some people in a minute,” said Jessi.

“Me neither,” I said. “Who are you kidding?”

So I did. I told Jessi what I had planned. I told Abby what I had said, too, and I told Stacey about what I had planned. And on to Claudia, who was already studying with Mrs. Stone.

I had hoped I’d tell everyone about the meeting Mrs. Stone had with Mr. DeWitt, but no. I knew there were other things I wanted to tell. For instance, we’ll never know what happened between Kristy and Claudia about the toys Kristy can play with? (Kristy can play with toys and things, but Claudia can’t.) And when Dawn and I went on any of our trips to England, Stacey left the house for a while. Why? Because her school life was taking a turn for the worse.

I was still waiting for answers when Stacey called again. This time, it was Dr. Patels, not Sharon. They didn’t show up to our meeting, but they were out of town for a while. (Stacey missed the Patellis’ visit, and Kristy wanted to visit with a friend.) We both knew Dr. Patelpather would probably come back to school and try to help out, but then her boyfriend, Logan Bruno, had already left.

There was more to the story than the phone call
