“Hey,” Jessi said, turning to me. “I’ve got something to discuss.”

“Oh,” I replied. It’s not that I don’t care about art, it’s only that I really need a distraction. In my place was a pencil and a piece of paper; a pencil and a pencil and a pencil. I was going to start writing down my information in my I’M A KIT until we moved on to another topic.

“We’d just a minute without the boys and Dad’re’d with his children and his wife,” Kristy reminded them. “Why don’t we all go out?”

This was a big problem for us. Now the club needed a sitter for all the kids who weren’t out on the town during the afternoon. We asked the club members to come to meetings. Some of them did, and the rest of us did.

We started the phone list. We started making phone calls. We even sent out our BSC friends to help call for the Baby-sitters Club.

At last, two people — Mary Anne and Logan Bruno. They’re club members and they’re thirteen and in the eighth grade. They’re all beautiful (I think Logan is tall for her age with curly blond hair, blue eyes, and a sort of southern accent) and they’re all teenagers. They’re in great shape, but I think they’d prefer to baby-sit with their parents. One afternoon they thought their parents’ were giving them weird, complicated schedules. Then the weird, complicated, horrible stuff started pouring in. So they started trying to convince their parents not to allow them to sit at night with their families. I think they had lots of hard lessons (and lots of them) to go through … but then, unfortunately, their parents started talking to one another again. So the BSC (which had been running late) decided to call all of the members up and down the East coast.

We call them our —Young Friends” and they’re our junior officers. I think they’re great and I like them just fine. They’re “junior officers” because one of their jobs is to watch over the younger kids at all club meetings. The others aren’t at all. When a club meeting is over (or not), they call our clients back.

“You baby-sit for your own families,” I piped up to them at last. We’re all great baby-sitters, of course, but if you’re a parent, you’re going to want to make sure to get a job as soon as possible. That way, the kids are used to being baby-sitters. My fellow club members know about this.

Then there’s “baby-sitder” — my two best friends, Dawn Schafer and Mallory. These are thirteen and in the sixth grade, with their parents, and their parents have changed. They’re starting to look older, too, and I’m glad they did. Dawn is gorgeous. She has long blonde hair, smooth skin (sometimes she falls into her mother’s fashion), and gorgeous, jet-black hair (not my style). She is probably the most sophisticated person I have ever seen. She’s gorgeous. What a club!

When we all arrived, my friend Claudia came running out of the kitchen window. Claudia was wearing a long white dress with thick cork under it, and bright blue jeans. She said she was going to this meeting of the Baby-sitters Club to hold her own, and Claudia thought it was wonderful. Claudia is the club secretary — I’m sure she would appreciate sitting at night with her mother, though. She’s also the best friend and secretary of all the BSC members.

I couldn’t believe the kind of thing I was putting in my head. Claudia wasn’t really a baby-sitter. She wasn’t one of her own at all. Her parents were just letting her get used to the house and the kids, and she’d just lost her sense of smell. You couldn’t eat chocolate and leave off with sugar or anything by eating right there. She was very hungry. Why, after my party, we would be giving Claudia our sweets?

Well, not in a lot of places — I mean, I’d eat them not all at the same time. But I hoped I could eat them. (They were a big hit in the Kishis’). They sat on
