======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the house was kind of quiet. In fact, you'd think that was a big enough secret for her to keep quiet about it, except for the fact that she wants to be a writer and illustrator of children's books.

She keeps two books on her back, one of which is a children's book, and, although we don’t know quite what the sixth grade book is, she tries to read it whenever she can. She has a short younger sister named Becca, and a baby brother named Robert, Jr., whom she calls, in addition to a little sister named Becca and a aunt named Janine. She lives with the family all by herself, although she and her parents work very hard to provide for her in-laws and other responsibilities.

What they don’t know is that her mom died a long, long time ago, and that Mr. McGill has been raising Miss Universe. I guess it was because Miss Universe wants to be totally cool, and she is totally gorgeous.

Mr. McGill is a pretty nice guy, Mary Anne’s idea of a cool person. He’s not a very good one, at least in my opinion, besides being the one who was dating the guy who was in high school, Bart Taylor. That was Mr. Spier, who’s kind of a jerky jerk and who doesn’t care what other people think of him at all. And he didn’t. Not one bit. That’s not why Mary Anne was upset, though. She’s just been kind of unhappy lately.

One other thing about Mary Anne. Her family. Her aunt. Also the Pike house. Mary Anne’s family also consists of her mother, father, and her stepsister, their pets, and their mother. Mr. and Mrs. Pike are always pushing over a pile of junk food because it’s so darn confusing.

When they first got married, Mary Anne had just wanted to be Mary Anne. Then she began to crave attention. It was hard to resist, especially after all those years. But when her parents got divorced and her dad moved back to Stoneybrook, she started to crave Mr. and Mrs. Schafer’s attention. Somehow, though, Mary Anne managed to stay away from other people and keep her distance. And when her parents got remarried, they decided to get really, really together. Which is not to say that they couldn’t. But they didn’t feel there was anything they couldn’t do about it.

That’s what made them do it. Mary Anne and her father decided to reach out to other people, and to reach out to Stoneybrook, too. Which meant, naturally, that Mr. Spier made arrangements with Mrs. Schafer to meet at Mr. Schafer’s house every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and to go over some of their wishes about being best friends.

You’d think that some of the best friends in the world could have so many different interests would be shared by two people who are very different.

Here’s what happened. First, Stacey’s mother got remarried, and Mr. Spier married Mrs. Schafer. So Stacey was the new best friend. It was a great thing for Stacey to happen at the beginning of a new life. (And it also meant that, once again, we were all new clients.) Then Stacey’s grandmother, Mimi, moved in to help out. And in five minutes, that old big house had already been completely razed.

Wow! That was so true. I was so impressed that I wanted to leave it there. I was looking forward to the day I got to live in Stoneybrook.

Things turned out great for Stacey and the rest of us. We got a great club job, which was very impressive. We were invited to the BSC (Big Show Is On Me) Baby-sitting Camp, and Claudia got a great set of her really cute little black kitten cat ears. All that said, there was still a little time left, and we were making up our schedules so we couldn’t attend every BSC meeting. I was excited. But I wasn’t so excited because I didn’t think I would ever be able to take that bus to the local supermarket and buy some instant-classic books — because I guess that would be a lot more work than just taking a picture every day. So I told myself that I wouldn’t need to worry about that. Maybe I was being generous. But I was hoping that some of the other BSC members would be too.

Anyway, there was still enough time for an announcement. Everyone had to gather around the kitchen table — my parents, Claudia, and Dawn, and
