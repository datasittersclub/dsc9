======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 down about my room

My phone's ringing and calling, I'm reading from my room notebook with two crunches attached. I glance at my phone, and see the handwriting on one side of it: The date is Monday, and my phone is dialed on Monday as I write my phone book. That's five!

What on earth is going on, I ask myself. What is there to know about the club that I haven't just discovered? Or the information to know about another club that I haven't yet discovered? (The first one I know of is from the BSC.) It's called the DSC, or Devil's Club.

Oh, that's right. I was going into the club's official records, when I remembered the names and the schedules. And now we don't even have a BSC official record anymore.

Why are we holding down our meetings? I can only guess because we don't have a BSC record. I guess there is an exception to the rule in the New York offices. (At least I know who happens to be in that office.)

There are several members of the club in the BSC. They are all junior officers, which means they aren't required to pass muster. Their jobs are to be junior officers of the club, sitters on our meetings, and, sometimes, treasurer and officer of the BSC. They are also responsible for checking on the club's activities, running our club's official record books, and keeping record notes.

Like most members of the BSC they have very, very little experience. They spend about the entire morning playing with baby-sitters or playing with kids. As I write right now I have five friends, all of us in the club.

In addition to the BSC members, there are a dozen new members coming to our meetings every Monday and Wednesday. Those new members come because of our new meeting schedule. (I will admit to a feeling of déjà vu, of course, but my mind is pretty clear about it.) And I know who's coming. The BSC's members have a lot of interesting stuff to do on Mondays during summer. Here are some ideas.

Get the club's calendar straight up and organized from the top. (As if a club weren't great enough, a calendar book is a great way to organize information. For instance, we'll be looking at a club meeting on Mondays, Wednesday, and Friday.)

Get your schedules in order. We have a club schedule for the Mondays in our calendar. You'll need to book your meetings by telephone, and get them with us.

If you're attending Mondays, have a notebook. It's in your notebook. I would call the club and write the details down every Monday, and I have it ready for you to write down in a notebook. Then I will write your schedule in the notebook. Then I'll find a way to send some calls to clients with the details. (One way is to write a notebook, just with the information in.) Then you can find out who you should call or when you should be to arrange the meetings.

I hope this information helps a little. I guess that's what our calendar has been all our lives. Well, now we are all about to make it our business to write down what we do and what we hate to share with the world. And that, I promise you, isn't about to end. You'll see.

The club is organized to the highest of our abilities. That's because most of the members have family lives — they're not the most successful kids, but they're the most successful adults. I know these families better than most of you. I know them pretty well. I can tell you how successful they are by listening to my stories and having those stories out before I have to look them over by the eyes. (I used to do this just to show you who the kids are.)

The best stories come with the kids. Not the stuff that happens in the homes they live in, but the stories I tell (or tell about it). The stories are all true. The stories are real.

I know this to be true, too, whether you're a kid, a dad, a mother or an officer of the club. That's the great part of the club — the whole truth about who we are. We believe in everybody, even those around us, and our members know exactly how to sit, what they eat, what their parents say, and everything else that comes along with it.

Everyone's an artist or a musical instrument. We believe in the use of creativity. We believe in the art we make and that includes creating. Everyone has to be talented. We've all made good decisions.

But we all do good things with little to no effort. We just know what we want to do when necessary. Plus, we all always have the same idea
