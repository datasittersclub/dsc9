 to be a special sort of person. She’s easygoing, sensitive, and (to me) very romantic, with blue eyes and long, curly hair (it’s almost like her body). I like her a lot and really do (everything she does).

As secretary, Mary Anne Spier’s job is to schedule the job on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Sometimes, after meetings (which are usually club meetings), Mary Anne finds a sitter and has the entire job booked. Then she gets to take a few jobs, which don’t interest her. Sometimes, being secretary isn’t so bothersome because she is tough and smart and loves kids — even kids!

I think Mary Anne’s love of kids is what keeps her organized and happy. She used to live on Long Island, where so many of her friends are like her. Mary Anne’s dad died in a car accident when Mary Anne was six. I know because I sat for her and her brothers. It was the most unimaginable thing in the world when you realized what had happened to your father. You’d been adopted, and all of a sudden you’d been so close to him that you’d feel all warm and loved. I wanted so badly to marry him, but I wasn’t able to come close. This was the hardest thing I’d had to do — to leave New York, and I knew it was going to be hard for Mary Anne. She was leaving the city she loved so much. (Mary Anne is originally from Long Island.) She could never get over how hard New York became for her father and brother. It really made her feel warm and grown-up in the city.

It was a good thing, too, because in the next few months Mary Anne picked up a huge family. She got a mom, a mom, and a mom — a very large family! Her brothers and sisters didn’t change a thing. They just grew up. Now Mary Anne’s mom and dad were divorced, and her little brother, David Michael, was a toddler. Then her grandmother moved in, too, and all of the pets were there! With Mary Anne, you get to have a lot of pets. You want to be pet-sitting her someday, don’t you, Mary Anne?

I knew Mary Anne perfectly then. Every time we sat for her we put our heads together and said (in a whisperish voice) “Let’s see, I’m not meeting any of my friends,” or (to Stacey) “I better meet Claudia,” or (to Claudia, who is very sweet and sensitive) “Claudia, you’re going to be all over me.” (Stacey is about the biggest about age 13.)

“Hello, girls,” she said. At Claud’s door. “Is something wrong?”

“Nothing much,” said Kristy.

“Well, it’s almost time for a BSC meeting,” said Mary Anne. “Just leave her out, though.”

Kristy wasn’t about to call this a day. She was about to. The meeting was nearly over, and I think we managed to talk a lot before Dawn left for California. Which brings me to the next item on the alphabetical pile that is our club. As you might guess, we have club business.

As I mentioned, we also have club mailing addresses. That’s because mailings are a big issue for our club these days. We hardly ever have to advertise anymore — we just have to make sure our reach is good. And we have to know how to make them.

Well, club dues are important. But we also keep records for each of us. That’s where Kristy comes in. She’s the founder of the club, and she knows how to keep things organized. In other words, she runs the club like a business at the top of her knowledge base.

Here’s how the club works. We meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty until six. People who need sitters call during that time, and we schedule our jobs according to which sitters are free for that job. We figure out who might be free for that job based on the needs of the children we sit for. We never charge for those services. That’s what makes the club such a good business (especially for Kristy), but it isn’t always — and always isn’t always — free baby-sitting. In the past few years, we have become good sitters for a family with two kids up front (Kristy and her three brothers, Charlie and
