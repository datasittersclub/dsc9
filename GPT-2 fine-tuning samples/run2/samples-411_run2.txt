’s, and “everything’s “right.”

“I have to stop teasing you.”

“But aren’t you teasing me?” asked the BSC member in meekest possible way.

“No wonder I’m worried,” I replied. “I’ve decided I’ll start school and everything.”

“I’ll start school?” cried Abby. “You’re going to go to Stoneybrook? I’m starting the A’s. This is crazy, isn’t it?”

“I would like to be a kid. I’d just gotten my mother’s permission to practice violin after all these years,” said Abby quickly. “Now I’ll try to concentrate on the A’s and make up for lost time. Well, I’ll see if Mom likes it.”

“She’ll,” I said. “You know she likes it.”

“You know, that’s right. She’ll like it, is what I mean.”

“She’ll like it,” we said, discussing the BSC and what was expected of us during the summer.<|endoftext|>
“Hey, guys. You know I’m not home yet. I’ve got time to myself. It is going to be a busy week. I’ll leave Paris early for lunch and get on my bike home.”

I took a long look around Stoneybrook when I stepped out of the car.

“How did I knock on your door?” demanded Stacey, sounding a little bored.

I answered.

“No problem,” she replied. “See, Mom? I have something I need to talk to Dad about. Mrs. Papadakis said I had something important to talk to you about.”

“My mom?” I repeated. “How else will Dad be doing?”

“I know that thing about the Papadakises,” Stacey replied. “I’m going to ask you to come over soon.”

“Will you come over first?” asked Claudia.

“Sure,” I agreed. “Dad’s not home yet, anyway.”

“Mom?” asked Kristy.

“No, no. Mom’s not even home yet, though.”

(Kristy is the president of the BSC, she’s the vice president, and she’s always ready to talk and tell you what to do.)

“Thanks a lot,” I said.” I couldn’t wait till Mom showed up.

She didn’t come to be with me.

“I don’t know him enough to ask you to be the club treasurer,” Kristy said after she and I settled down, my bicycle on my back.

“No, I’m not asking you to be treasurer,” I told Kristy.

“Sure,” replied Kristy.

I smiled.

Kristy's face lit up at her. “Why don’t you go and find Dad?” she asked anxiously.

“Well,” I said, “it’s just a’s birthday.” Kristy turned away from me and stared at the clock at the end of the front door. “Three o’clock. Thirty-five-five then.”

“Three?” asked Claudia.

“Yes,” I repeated.

After all that searching, Kristy finally found Dad.

“Okay,” I said. (That’s how Kristy is at everything.) “I’ll leave it here, I guess.” I looked around the room. There wasn’t any of us around the house any longer.

“Okay,” said Kristy. She let out a big yawn.

“Kristy, you’re not the happiest here.”

“I know,” I replied, shaking my head in relief. "How did it go this long?”

“I’ll tell you what,” said Kristy, who had come through town for the weekend. “
