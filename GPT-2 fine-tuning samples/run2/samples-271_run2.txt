 business, is a real artist, too. I've never met anyone as sophisticated as Claudia. She wears the clothes of a fashion designer. She knows how to create cool and unique items. It frees up lots of other people to do more creative things with their money.

So, that's that for the BSC. I should have known by now that Claudia was pretty sophisticated. I was the first one of the kids to line up a job, and Claudia managed it. Of course, I was the only one lucky enough to get a job. But I wasn’t the only one lucky enough to get a job. Claudia's family (her father, her mother, her brother and sister) lives on the outskirts of Stoneybrook.

I’m not the only one lucky enough to have a good life out there. For me, it wasn’t just being an artist. It was being an athlete, too. It was a lot. I had to train myself up. I’m much more dynamic now than I was a year ago, when my father and I were so young that it was nearly impossible to move around.

I guess you can say I was the one lucky enough to win a gold medal. I’m actually glad I did it. What can you say about me, I’m sure?”

“I’d rather have a good life.” (My parents were not pleased) “The world’s most talented person. That’s a problem!”

I guess my school’s “t all great,” said Dad, who was still looking at my clock (actually, it looked like it was three-thirty) and listening to Claud's telephone call. “But I suppose you needn’t believe the lies that the Devil has hidden all these years.”

I did not believe the lies. I’d be so ashamed. It’s true. I don’t agree. I don’t even think there should be a Devil in Heaven, though.”

Dad looked at Claud, but he was not interested. He stared at my clock. Then he began to write his name in a book.

My dad must think he’s the Devil. “I think the Devil is trying to get in my way,” he said, reading him the entries into a book he’s about to start collecting in his bedroom.

He started to read again. I took a step back. I didn’t want my hair to fall out of my ears and get caught in it. But it did not. The clock read 5:20, as expected. If that wasn’t enough, he went into the notebook and the paper notebook. When I finished the entries, I turned to Dad and said, “You could always do better next time.”

The handwriting was written all over Dad’s head. “You know how much I hate the Devil.’ I looked at Claud blankly.

“You know what? I could tell you’d be doing better next time.”

“I don’t know,” said Dad. “There’s something about being in my way and feeling bad about it that I don’t want to talk about.

I took my hands back. “Don’t do what I did in the notebook.”

“I’d like to talk to you later, but I need to sleep now.”

“I guess the Devil will figure out who’s listening to who,” said Dad. “I’m so tired of watching your hair drop out at night and your cheeks glow when you talk.”

I smiled. “You know what I do?” I said. “And you can learn to read people and write about them.”

Dad thought I might like to read about that in my notebook. That’s exactly what he did. That week he came to my room and pulled out one of his old magazines.

Maybe he doesn’t read my Nancy Drew books anymore, because the girls in my elementary school used to read all those books on the shelf. (My best friends and I were really glad for the opportunity to read Nancy Drew. But I think that’s why we’re friends now.) Anyway, I was thinking about the article in the Nancy Drew journal, in which I write about how my friends and I ended up becoming friends even before the article started. I was writing about how my friends started having a romantic fall in love.

Suddenly everything went crazy with excitement. I was almost a year old and writing in
