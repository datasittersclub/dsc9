 Anne, and we have an awesome, fun-loving family. It's a real honor to have the BSC with Dawn, as well as to share her stories.<|endoftext|>
"I'm out! All out!" Stacey Bernhard, Kristy's stepsister, suddenly burst into the room as Jessi Ramsey took my brother's arm and held him in the air.

"What's the matter?" I offered when I saw the announcement. "We've even got a couple of new members? Everyone's club meets this week in Claudia's room until then."

Here I was, in my first meeting of the club, since seventh grade. Claudia Kishi was sitting casually on Claudia's bed, which was on Claudia's desk. She was writing in a book, and she was reading a book she was holding in one hand. Both of them had long, black hair combed together; her eyes were set perfectly dark, and she looked positively as if she were writing a masterpiece. "This meeting will now come to order," the other said. "Thanks, everyone!"

"Good enough," I said, nodding. I'd already been in Claudia Kishi’s room, so I knew she was looking on from the other end of Claud’s room. "I’m glad we’ve gotten to this juncture," I said, making a face. "We’ve found out something important. The important thing is, I’m going to order everybody out first. All you need is this cookie and two apples. We can eat until six. Then we’ll sit for yourself."

Claudia, Mary Anne, Stacey, Claudia, Mary Anne, and I were all in the room except Stacey, and we were all waiting for one of our jobs to start. The club president, who I guess isn’t involved with so much in office stuff, smiled shyly, and said,

"Bye-bye!"

My friends burst into the room, which was so crowded that I was surprised what they’d get in return — pizza. "Pizza?" one said. (I think she meant chocolate-chip cookies.) "This meeting begins," said Kristy, "unless Mr. Spier calls to order." We all waited for the meeting to heat up, but Claudia really started to act as if the whole thing were a publicity stunt.

"We’m only here a few minutes," she continued. "After that there’s plenty of time for everything." Claudia makes us wait, she insists. Everyone agrees. By five o’clock we’re already in Claudia’s room, on the floor. The club secretary, Stacey, is in the director’s chair at our meeting, looking at the schedules of all the sitting jobs. That’s why the secretary is a genius, because she knows all the details, including the people’s schedules.

"We should get to work," Stacey was saying.

"We’ve got time," Claudia corrected us. "We’ve got time."

"Good!" cheered Kristy. "You do it right. Now we’ve got a few minutes left."

Claudia smiled triumphantly.

"All right, everyone, here is the meeting," she continued. "This meeting will come to order. And as always, everybody takes just one minute — five minutes — to get to the bottom of what’s going on."

Claudia was sitting in Claudia’s director’s chair, her hands folded in front of her face. Her feet were pressed together, toes curling together, arms curving in a way that I’m not entirely convinced is consistent with toe mass.

"All right, everyone, now let’s turn the attention to the meeting," Kristy said. "The meeting is adjourned."

"Okay," everyone agreed.

"Well, that's it, everybody," Kristy continued. "Bye-bye."

Claudia looked up from her schedule, then nodded. "It’s a good sign, everybody."

The meeting was in session, but not in the middle of a lecture. That’s because the members of the BSC are very private. They do what they like. But they also try very hard to keep things quiet. That’s why we meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon from five-thirty until six, and parents can call then to arrange for sitters.

There’s one other thing you should know about the BSC. Here are the people I’ve told you about — Kristy, Stacey, Mary Anne, Dawn, Jessica Ramsey, and Mary Anne (everyone’s in there
