 is a good person and you ought to behave professionally. And, I know, that's just the way she is. That's what makes her such a good person.

Mary Anne, who is tall, thin, and graceful, is our first call girl for the Baby-sitters Agency. Not only does she have long blonde hair and almond-shaped eyes that are actually pretty cool (she is the BSC's all-time leading girl), but she goes about handling boys pretty well. I think she’s been seeing more than she bargained for.

Our other first-call girl, our associate member, is Laine. That’s another name for Mary Anne’s best friend, Mallory. She’s really cute and sweet, and very well adjusted. Laine is also short (she wears sweaters and little-kid clothes at the same time) and she has a boyfriend, Logan Bruno. But while Laine is always on the outspoken side, Mary Anne is quiet and practical. She’s also not convinced boys are too shy to fall in love (believe me — I've seen that movie).

That’s because she and Laine are best friends and they have lots in common. For one thing, they’re both pretty advanced in some ways (Mary Anne is more like Laine’s — mature) and they both have pet hamster-type habits (less eating ham and more cheese). Laine also loves to read and write, while Mary Anne seeks inspiration from the mysteries of Marguerite Henry. (I wonder if she thinks Tinkerbell might be interested in the mysteries or not.)

Both Mary Anne and Laine have silver-tipped star ears, which mean they can’t talk during happy hour. But Laine’s are very sophisticated. They have the most gorgeous, wild-colored hair and she wears glasses.

And there you have it. Meet the Baby-sitters Agency members.

“What are they?” Laine asked.

(I gave her my best,” she said, “to tell you the truth.)

Laine (brought my attention to attention) looked at Laine and I awkwardly — like, two seconds. “We are the Baby-sitters Club, all right. Now, let’s sit through an ordinary baby-sitting class. You know, a lot of you are going through this thing called study hall,” she said. (I couldn’t help grinning. Did I mention that Laine can be a little impatient?)

Laine and I sat down and watched a movie in the theater like a hawk watching a bad hawk. During one frame, I could tell a huge grin was on Laine’s face. Then she flipped her eyes away and smiled back.

At the end of the movie, Laine said, “And I wish we could all be more adorable,” but the rest of us kept talking about her.

“Ahem! You guys!” I said. I tried to hide my laughter. I don’t want my friends to think I didn’t know what was going on with my mom, but I know I’d have to make some lists and stay away from Laine’s jokes. I also know that Laine tries her hardest not to get caught up in jokes.

Laine doesn’t seem to like all the jokes. I guess it’s part of her charm, but it sure doesn’t stack up.

Laine and I are the youngest of eight members. (We’re sure the other ones are the youngest too.) When Laine and I got our parents together, we decided to get joined by another member of our club, Logan, who’s only in California now. (He’s back in California now, and he’s doing really well.)

Logan is kind of an associate who doesn’t come to club meetings. He’s really neat and smooth. (Well, sort of.) He doesn’t look like a typical associate, but I almost expected someone like him. He has curly brown eyes, blue-blue-and-green-striped glasses, and is tall with dark brown-brown hair.

Logan is also a fantastic baby-sitter. He’s easy to spot, because he’s easy to talk to. If you ask him a bunch of questions, or push a button on his phone, he’ll probably tell you the answer. (Logan, you’re telling me, is amazing.)

Logan’s great, too. Amazing considering that he’s only in the sixth grade. That’s how he grew up.
