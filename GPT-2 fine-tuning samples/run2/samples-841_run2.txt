 brown-skinned or not. It was always difficult to tell apart a person by the way he or she dressed, or talked, or acted. For example, Mary Anne and my dad wouldn't mow the lawn if we didn't go out with our dad. And although he has a huge following, he's still an out-of-towner.

Mr. Spier moved to Stoneybrook from California after his divorce. He had been an officer for almost as long as Mary Anne’s, but he just couldn’t seem to find the right person for her.

After the announcement about Mr. Spier’s marriage, everyone started laughing. It was nice to see him back in the West Coast, although his natural home wouldn’t have been the same. Mr. Spier left the club very soon after he did that.

I think he simply couldn’t adjust to his new life. Maybe he was still hoping he’d be reunited with his father, but Mary Anne and Dawn sure didn’t think that was possible.

Then something unexpected happened. Dawn’s mom married again. She had only been looking forward to this for a while, and it occurred to Mary Anne that she might as well get a divorce. And that would be bad for her.

However, Mary Anne had her plans straight. She called the BSC with the information she needed. She told them what she had done during the last months of my life, and they told her to get over it. They told Dawn and me to get over it, too. And Mrs. Schafer to get over it. They made some good friends, but the rest of us just sort of happened to think that Dawn and I was sort of a bunch of snobs when we first met.

Anyway, Mrs. Schafer has been helping to make things right for all these years. She’s had a lot of experience with people, and figured it would be a good idea to try to work things out. At first, she couldn’t. Her idea of a bunch-one person problem solved. But they worked in unison to get things to work out. And that’s exactly what happened, thank goodness.

The Baby-sitters Club is one of my best friends in the world, but I’m not always as organized as I am in school. (Or as presidential.) For example, I have two associates, Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne. They help out when I have extra work, but they don’t have many regular jobs. Logan is a junior officer, which means he takes a little afternoon jobs, as we call him. Shannon, who is not nearly as active and involved in sports as the rest of us, is Mary Anne’s friend and mother. We’ve known each other since we were little. And Mary Anne and I have even been friends as children, even though we were kids together. Shannon was the oldest of eight kids and one of the top kids. That’s why she had to go to Sea City for a while, despite everything.

So it’s not a perfect record-keeping system, but it’s complete and straight. The Baby-sitters Club is the best in the world, and our clients have been very helpful. Isn’t it interesting how little they’ve met? It sure is.<|endoftext|>
I was in the hospital wing that Wednesday afternoon, doing everything I could to help get the other wing ready for business. I was holding an MRI on a bed, trying to see what was wrong with my back.

We all went into the main wing, then came down a long hallway to the left of the others—Jessi, Stacey, Margo, and Dawn, and made our way over to Claudia Kishi’s room.

“Hi,” said Stacey, who was sitting on the floor, her hands all over her hair. “I hope you’re okay.”

“Oh,” I said. “You’re going to be okay, Stace.”

“I hope so,” she added, smoothing her curly hair, “and I hope I’m not making any mistakes.”

I was making big mistakes as I tried to save face, and it wasn’t good.

We kept looking at each other and trying to think of words to describe the things we were going through.

What would it feel like to be the only one having a serious case? To be the only one having it? That’s what Kristy had thought about me when she talked about me. Not that I was complaining. It was just that the rest of us (or at least Jessi and me
