 my life so well that now she’s very glad she didn’t go. When I think about how pretty Stacey looks, I’m amazed. She looks just like Charlotte Goode — slender, blonde, and pretty — but much cooler. Maybe because her clothes are so cool. She is a very individual person.

When Stacey didn’t have a mom, her dad raised her practically in his bedroom. He had two kids: her firstborn, Anna and her secondborn, baby Linny, who are two and a half. Then, too, his kids live with him — Emily Michelle (four) and Andrew (seven). Stacey’s mom met this man named Watson Brewer at a pizza party (a regular party?) and married him. After that, the Thomases moved into Stacey’s room. But it was a change of pace, and Stacey couldn’t adjust to her new life. (Her parents, meanwhile, adopted a two-year-old girl from Vietnam.) She has a Bernese mountain dog puppy named Shannon who, believe it or not, lives with the Brewers. And when she and Stacey were married, they thought they’d get a Bernese mountain dog puppy named Shannon to keep their mom busy.

I’ll back up. I think my memory picture of Stacey would be a crab with a huge heart and a car with six people on it. Probably Stacey, but in a completely different order.<|endoftext|>How do you even begin to think about the BSC? That’s what everyone would want answered. I just can’t keep up.”

It was Monday afternoon at five-thirty — my birthday! Sunny had collected our dues (that was a new method of paying dues), and we were all gathered at Sunny’s with a perfect time.

“So, who does this to me on Mondays?” Sunny asked.

I shrugged. “Anybody?”

With a loud crinkle, Sunny’s hand struck the bottom of our plastic treasury envelope. “You do that on Mondays,” she announced. She studied the dues notes in her desk. Then, as if remembering the occasion, she wrote it into the record book.

“What about you?” I asked.

“No, I’m going to work on Tuesday.” Sunny glanced at the envelope in her hands. Then, as if remembering a long weekend, she said, “Well, I’ll write it down. But,” she paused. “Sunshine?”

“Oh.” I broke into a grin. “Good.”

“Write it down, and then punch it in my face.”

I don’t know how I got here, but Sunny and I used to sit in Sunny’s front yard one day listening to her tell me where to buy concert tickets, and where to buy her big mouth jokes. We thought it would be hilarious. But we’re really, really bad at understatement. In actuality, we think we’re pretty cool.

Sunshine was now our new face (and the first member here), and we were hanging out again at Sunny’s, this time between Sunny and me. We liked each other a lot, so I asked if I could join their club. You see, I’m a carnivalese: I like to eat everything and everything. I like to eat things, too, including horse meat. I can’t stand horse meat. I miss horse meat a lot. And I think my “high-calorie vegetarian” diet makes me tingle just thinking about it.

Anyway, I was getting off that Tuesday afternoon, driving my four-year-old brother (Charlie has strict father-and-daughter rules) to our BSC meeting. Mrs. Schafer had called Nannie about a week ago, who was going crazy with junk food (Charlie has to watch his cereal). And the SMS Express arrived right on time. Sunny called Mrs. Schafer and told her to expect a stampede, very fast.

She also told her, and the rest of us, to expect a stampede. Which is what they did.

They took my sister, Margo, and I into their homes, starved us, and nearly drove us to taking medication. But they kept coming. At one point, the Express even set up shop in my room, so I got a flashlight. From my flashlight I can see who is in the house — bright lights, bad lights, or bright middle teens.

And I can tell you, my friends, I had to go through the motions of all those parties and doctors, and lots of unnecessary stuff
