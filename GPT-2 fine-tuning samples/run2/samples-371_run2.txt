"It's a good idea," Mary Anne had said as she sat there, staring out the window. "But I have to say, it looks horrible if it doesn't."

"It can be ugly," Abby had replied. "It's so ugly I don't even see the front door."

Mary Anne grinned at Abby and me.

"I'm not saying it's uglyâ€”it's just that it's not quite perfect," Jessi said.

"It's just that the windows are out, but the sound is much better," Mary Anne said. "And the dust isn't all that bad either."

"It's just the porch, aren't you? How does the weather wind up here?" I asked. "I have some idea."

"But it takes a while to settle in," Mary Anne explained. "I think the wind will drift in until it gets here."

"But there's nothing to be worried about," Jessi added. "It's just that I think if we don't wind up here in Portcullis, it won't be long until the BSC is here for good." They weren't right, but they weren't awful either.

Mary Anne, as secretary of the BSC, was a busybody. She wasn't very busy either, although we occasionally have to be, because she runs the club very, very, very, fast. She used to be our treasurer, after all, but she's been out of the club forever. Even though she's gone, the other girls still consider her the worst treasurer, since they didn't get to know her well when she was treasurer. They thought she was too nice, too bossy, too overprotective, too shy. She even ended up getting remarried, just so her older sister, who had grown up in Stoneybrook, can finally visit them there. Mary Anne has a new stepfather, a stepbrother, and a stepsister, too, and recently her mom and dad got married. (The divorce was hard on Mary Anne because she had returned to see her dad, and her new stepfather had been very generous, too, to say the least.)

In my opinion, Mary Anne is an absolute dweeber. She gets along really well with her boyfriend, Logan, and with Mal and Jessi, who is a very sweet girl.

"I knew it would be bad here," Abby said after she got to see the rear door, though she was looking up at me from her seat. She hadn't expected to be mugged.

"Hey, guys," Mallory said, waving her arms to the window. "It could be bad."

I was sure the BSC members knew it. I know they don't.

"What do you think it would be like if a cat went missing in a restaurant?" Jessi asked as she went to search for something to call for. A big, scary cat? Jessi has a crush on a cat, probably the world's biggest cat. She and Abby have known each other since long, and they love animals. I like the idea of a cat being able to hide from a dog, for instance. And that's what Jessi and Jessi are most excited about.

"I'm hoping it's the dog of choice," Jessi said excitedly.

"Who would miss it?" Mallory asked.

"I'm sure Logan wouldn't mind," Mal volunteered.

"I'm sure I'd love to see one, too," Mal said.

"I'm sure I'd love to sit next to that cat," Abby said.

Mal was very happy to have a cat. She and Jessi are best friends. There have been times when they've been very different. I think it helps that Jessi is a great ballerina, and Mal is in ballet, too, since she's in seventh grade at Stoneybrook High School. While Mal would usually go to Stoneybrook or Kentucky (it's the only school where she's a member), Jessi is the athlete.

Jessi won her first BSC award in eighth grade. She's also the club's alternate officer, which means she fills in for anyone who has to miss a meeting.

"I'm so happy to be a BSC member," Jessi said as she sat down on the armchair she shares with Mal. Jessi is the oldest baby in her family. She has brown hair or brown eyes and is Japanese-American. She's pretty, with a great sense of style. Her best friend is Abby Stevenson, the president of the BSC and another member of the BSC. She's an excellent dancer, with perfect posture, perfect hips, and graceful hands. She has gorgeous blue eyes and she looks
