“What’s going on?”

He said it.

“I don’t get it,” I said. “It’s just a bunch of kids.”

I looked at him, and I felt relieved — like I were very, very glad we were friends.’

“What’s wrong?” I asked him.

“Um … well, I haven’t experienced the feeling yet,” said the director of the meeting.

He shrugged. “Not exactly. It’s just that I think it’s weird.”

“Okay.” I continued to explain.

“I guess this meeting, of course,” said another.

“And what’s going on at the N.Y.C.E.?”

“The N.Y.CC.”

I looked up. There were three people there — Mary Anne Spier, Marguerite Henry, and Cecelia. They were all sitting on mattresses. They’d probably never sleep right, and they’d never see eyes. Claudia’d wearing a pink bikini with red earrings and white sneakers, and she stood on the floor, facing the door, with a huge grin on her face.

Claudia was the one who pulled the phone down, but she’d not say where we were, exactly, because, naturally, she couldn’t tell you. She’d just asked, and I said I had no idea.

That’s Kristy (Kristy. Kristy. Kristy, you’ll find out soon enough). During the Monday meeting, Kristy and I made up about an hour, and then, just to make sure I didn’t have any leftovers, I said we were going to buy a movie. I mean, I’d like to do that (right after that); or I would like to do that movie again (so we’ve already spent some time together).

I couldn’t decide. I tried to think of something, but I couldn’t decide. Not until we went back and checked.

“Any plans to come Monday?” asked Kristy.

Shannon was sitting on the couch and eating a bag of cookies.

“Oh, my lord!” I cried out.

The BSC was off again.

Kristy started looking at me. “Uh, Stacey?”

No wonder I feel the Berni-fry.

“What if?” Kristy asked me after the meeting had ended. (If nothing else, what would be next and Kristy’s feelings about that? We might have to talk about that next week, I guess.)

“Well, what do you say my friends?” Kristy asked.

“I would like more privacy —” I said.

The silence fell. No more privacy. In fact, she just said that it’s time for us to do something about the BSC. We started the meeting in a neat pile and made some phone calls and exchanged good old stories about what had just been said. One that was interesting was about the old BSC.

The meeting started at the meeting table and ended with a big hug. It was Kristy, my boyfriend, and I, sitting across from Claudia. We sat in Claudia’s place, listening to our favorite old BSC stories. I think we all missed it.

Lately, Kristy’s gotten bored. She has some problems with her hair and her outfit. She doesn’t have the looks or formliness to make it look great. She’s a complete laff.

The problem seems to be that now that she’s back at the BSC, she’s not able to take care of herself. Her mom lives near Kristy and Sharon, her younger sister Dawn, and another sister, Becca.

Mrs. Thomas died when Kristy lived in Hawaii. I think her death is hard to tell. She’d have two sisters, Claudia and Mallory. (The others live on Long Island, which is the other island, but they’re pretty different.)

I met her when she was just a little girl, and we were friends for a while. We were best friends until a few years ago. It was then, in fact, that I became best friends with Mallory, who has blonde hair (she’s only thirteen), and pale skin. That was my problem. She’s like me, and she lived
