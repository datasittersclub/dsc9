) the phone goes off the hook, you can still reach the meeting. The other phone call was about the same (and with different) as everyone else because that was when we had the Baby-sitters Club meeting.

Claudia and I just hung out, though, and I started discussing whether we could bring our Free Babies Club group to Stoneybrook or not. Jessi and Mallory were holding hands and we stopped talking about the BSC, our business. It was funny — Jessi and Mal were laughing, too — but I felt a little silly. The BSC is not like the BSC — I know some people in the Baby-sitters Club may even find the BSC funny, but I was not, so either I or Jessi decided to get out of the club and go back to my room. I did that, of course. I made a note of it in my diary.

By that time they were talking about our trip to Vietnam. While I was still waiting for Claudia, Mal took a picture of her phone case. I couldn't believe it. Mal's phone case is like a glove case. It's like a sponge covering up contacts and earrings. Mal is shy, romantic, and funny. Her picture would be in the case if someone put it on.

I took another picture of my camera.

I carefully took the picture. I just hope it's the best. I love to make baby pictures.

I took the picture again. This time to show Mal I'll never, ever forget her picture.

Mal said, "Oh, Mal, good boy, it's a busy day."

"Good boy!" Claudia giggled. "It was just over two o’clock when I got it!"

We settled ourselves on Claudia's bed. I set it on the spot to show my best friend, Mal, and I were looking at one another. (I'm the vice-president. I get plenty of sleep here.)

Claudia was gazing at the digital clock on Claudia's desk. Claudia knows a minute has come in the club meeting that day. It's almost exactly one minute.

"How cool would it be?" Mary Anne Spier asked. "We're in Vietnam right now, just waiting for the BSC offices to open."

"I could fly," said Claudia. "I could get ready. Take off the scarf."

I didn't even think about the scarf.

Mary Anne put back her hand that reminded her of where she was. She flipped the scarf toward me and leaned toward me. "You look terrific," she murmured, her voice dropping a little so it didn't sound loud. Her eyes were shut.

"You look terrific too!" I said.

Logan Bruno and I look awfully alike. Our hair has dark brown or reddish-brown hair, glasses, and glasses, and we wear our contacts almost as often as we do our ears and nose (which are both pierced as Claud says).

"I looked terrific!" said Logan.

"All night," I explained. "The light was shining through my glasses and through my contacts. I was practically wearing the scarf."

"Good idea," said Logan. "It took me just another second."

"You look terrific too," I concluded.

"All morning we'll be doing whatever we need to do, Dawn. We'll be doing our usual routine for the day — washing the hair, combing the hair, combing the hair, whipping, cutting."

"Yesssss," I concluded. "Okay, I'll go. But first here is our schedule," Mary Anne began. "The BSC meeting."

"You know we're here for that," I said. "We're already booked up for the next meeting."

We did our usual routine here. Claudia, Mal, and I sit in Claud's room. Each of us stands in a director’s chair, looking at our schedules, then we count the number of appointments as we go. We don’t sit in Claud’s room all the time, of course, but I’m always in good mood.

And it’s all happening, on several floors. At my own expense.

My next job is to the left of the meeting, in my usual place of sitting. I’ve decided to sit in Claud’s room because I think it’s convenient, especially because (as it happens) my room is on Claud’s way from New York City. I do the same thing in my own window with just my own director’s chair, which is why when I go to Claudia’s I stand at the director’s chair and wave to the kids in the group.

Before I go any further I should
