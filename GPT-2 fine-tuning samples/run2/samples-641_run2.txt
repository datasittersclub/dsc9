“Well, I guess I haven’t had that much time,” Mallory commented. “And Kristy’s having trouble at school but she’s doing well anyway.”

“Well, I guess she’s having trouble with Kristy,” I said. “I’ll call you right back.”

“Right’s,” Claudia replied.

“Kristy?” The others were asking as they rode past.

“This isn’t a class at SMS,” Kristy announced to us.

I looked at my watch. Eight o’clock.

Before I go on, maybe I better tell you a little about the BSC, but first I should tell you about myself. I’m the president of the entire BSC, Mary Anne Spier the vice-president, club secretary, and treasurer. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the way she dresses, and I admit, I was kind of embarrassed when I first met her.

Well, Kristy — that’s Kristy Thomas, the very cool and successful one! In fact, if you want to know about the rest of her life — all the ways she became "the world’s greatest athlete, greatest —” you have to talk to Kristy. You can tell by the way she runs the BSC, runs the BSC, and gets along well with other incredibly tall guys.

But she’s a good friend, and I think she’s also a great friend because — best of all, I think — friendship can be a good thing sometimes.

Okay, all right. Before we get started, some background. The BSC is the world’s biggest business — in terms of business, at least. Organized — that’s Kristy, my best friend and the president of the BSC. She is the club’s secretary (everyone else is the vice-president), as well as the club’s treasurer and creative officer. She keeps track of how the money is spent, which is really important. In the summer she collects dues from us each week, which she calls the club dues. As treasurer (luckily for Kristy), she pays Claudia’s brother Charlie for driving her to meetings.

Another important part of Kristy’s personality is her mother. Once, during a row of jobs, Kristy’s mom died and her family took care of herself. Kristy has always seemed to be strong and healthy, which is terrific, for example. But she can’t do the things she tries. She’s a bit of a whiner and snob, which is probably why she has become so popular (or very responsible) during her time in the BSC. Then there’s the time she and Claudia’s dad were caught in a car wreck and Kristy has to have every last ounce of strength to convince them to see each other seriously. Kristy also has to deal with being the only member really late for. That’s when the BSC was formed.

Anyway, Kristy’s mom was really into Stacey’s health when she was in the hospital, but now she feels guilty she didn’t do right things. The hard thing about that, I think, is that she didn’t take Stacey’s case the right way (maybe she could've handled it better). And unfortunately, as Kristy has learned, having a high schooler like Stacey is not the same as being a member of the BSC.

Anyway, as everyone’s saying, Kristy is pretty, but there are some people you should see more of: Logan Bruno — another girl who is pretty but a little on the thin side. I think that’s kind of a turn-off for her, since she has this great Southern drawl, which I think might just as well be a disease. (If I had to do something stupid like tell Watson, he’d freak out and tell me to get over it, it’s totally normal for me to freak out and tell him to get over it?) Kristy is very shy, but also a good friend. She’s also a little bit of a snob, which makes for some awful situations.

Speaking of awful — or not speaking to the other members of the BSC, since they are not allowed to baby-sit at night (except for their own siblings), or to go for long phone calls between parents, or anything like that, which is not the way of the BSC. Well, as you can see, things are not so easy for me at the moment. I
