======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Worme’s house, they found a lot of hiding-places, too. They also found piles of old toys, books, and stuff. (Mary Anne’s sister had gotten a job at the office of some sort.)

The discovery of the BSC was a big shock to Mary Anne and her family, but it was hard not to like her again. When they came across The BSC, they knew they needed her. And they loved her. It was great. But they miss her.

I’ve known every person who has ever lived in Stoneybrook, and they miss Mary Anne so much that we call them brothers.

Mallory and I are the oldest kids in the BSC, and it’s no surprise that we have the most important jobs on earth. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas (those two words are mine) love the fact that they’re all new to their families every year. Jessi and her baby brother, Squirt, are another good example.

Mallory’s family came over recently, in part due to her father’s marriage. That was a painful time for Mal and her family. First, her dad remarried. Then, her parents adopted four kids from Vietnam. Mal’s grandmother Suzi moved in to help care for them. Mal goes back to California to live with her dad. Oh, and Stacey, who happens to also be her best friend, is also from California. She and Mal are very close. Also, they have a lot in common, such as they both love to read, even though they’re pretty different. Mal likes horses and Misty likes to read. This is not to say that all of them are alike in some ways and different in some ways, but it shows that they complement each other.

I feel a little bad about this because I’m not sure that I like Mal as a person. She’s a little too shy and shymouthy — especially about music — and her dad acts as if he didn’t care what they thought of their family. But maybe Mr. and Mrs. Thomas had all those awful times together. And that happened as the two older brothers moved out of the neighborhood to move to — and Mal grew up here and there. I was glad, but I don’t know if I like the situation the way the BSC is.

The other club member who’s not in the BSC — and who probably wasn’t even in it — is Stacey McGill. She’s the oldest kid in the BSC, and she’s always coming up with great ideas — like Kid-Kits. Her mom is a real wrecking ball, and she always seems to be. They’re decorated boxes full of clothes, games, and games she wants to make herself. When she’s not making her own, she takes her work (she makes her own boxes, too) and goes shopping. We like her, though — and love her, too. And just in time, because she’s the only one in the club who has her private phone line. It frees us from having to tie up her family line for the meetings anymore. Stacey has had her ups and downs, but I’m glad she’s doing really well.

Jessi has brown hair and brown eyes, and she’s also in school dance. I like her too, since she’s from New York City, and she teaches us a lot of stuff.

I’m not going to lie. Me and Jessi’s parents are very different. Me? I’m not a very sophisticated person. I have a big BSC sister and two sisters only, a litter of other kids, plus an adopted twin. My friends here in Stoneybrook mean it when they say they think a girl would fit into the BSC. For instance, Jessi is best friends with Claudia. Claudia is with her best friend, Mary Anne. They even look alike. They look like tomboys — each has a hole in one ear and a hole in the other. Like me, Jessi’s small brown eyes would fit the BSC description. Her clothes would fit most any other club description: casual, trendy stuff, stylish fashion. Her dad’s name was originally from New York City.

I am the alternate officer, which means my job is to keep track of all our jobs. If a club job calls for me, I answer. In that role, I usually take over if any of our regular members are absent. Unfortunately, that doesn’t always happen, and that’s okay with me. I’m involved in almost all BSC meetings, but I have a definite duty to take care of the baby-sitting officers
