 from a mansion. It is a mansion because it is huge. There are even three movie sets, three times as many rooms as the one Kristy lives in. This was surprising since I have lived in Stoneybrook for six months and a half now. Anyway, Mrs. Thomas is a very sophisticated woman, with long, silky, black-and-white leggings — dresses every ounce of it, no matter how much her husband has toying around with his daughter, Karen (whom he has adopted). She used to live across the street from Kristy in a real yuppie lives arrangement.

What's surprising is that Kristy and Mrs. Thomas were neighbors before Kristy started to date Brewer. That's because each of them had something to do with the other's mother and father being divorced. So the Thomases had to decide how to go about reintroducing their mother and father. The hardest part was going exactly as Kristy had ordered.

After much experimenting (partly this because Mrs. Thomas wanted to be sure she wasn't the first one to adopt a toddler and also partly because Mrs. Thomas was busy finding a new mom), things finally worked out. While Kristy and Mrs. Thomas were at it, Mrs. Thomas found out the reason Kristy was being kept in the dark about her father and how to handle unwanted babies. The McGills had been sisters for quite a while, so at some point they discovered that the two of them were going to be triplets. They didn't really want that. They thought the McGills' mom was being a little bossy, but it wasn't the same. Not to mention, Kristy's mom now works at a publishing company and she's gotten certified as a mom in California. (At least her mother got that title as soon as she married Watson.)

I should explain. We've all been in a mental institution somewhere, but Watson and Mrs. Thomas have been best friends quite a bit. They grew up as a couple, but just before Kristy's wedding, Watson sent their mother an e-mail (the most outrageous one I'd ever encountered) that said, "Watson and Mrs. Thomas are available to baby-sit for any household size on weeknights." That left Watson with just four people available — me, Karen, and Andrew, and two sitting members — plus two associate members, Shannon Kilbourne and Logan Bruno.

Now, there are plenty of associate members out there, but I've never met anyone like Watson and Mrs. Thomas. Shannon Kilbourne is one of them. Shannon lives in Kristy and my neighborhood, and she goes to a private school called Stoneybrook Day School. She's a friend to pretty much everyone in our school, but she's not a huge personality. So when Watson announced that he was moving to Connecticut, Shannon went away to California for several months. And when the Thomases decided to adopt, Shannon took a different — but just the same — route.

Now Shannon is part of a blended family, but they are part of the community. She's a great person because she's a big influence on my school's athletics philosophy. Shannon is the oldest of four kids (she has seven now), and she has fluffy blonde hair, permed skin, and absolutely no braces.

Her sports are running, floating, and volleyball. She loves to read, especially horse stories, but she doesn't let this put her off. In fact, she enjoys horse stories even more than I do, because she enjoys sports too. Shannon likes to write and illustrate her stories, and she has a lot of respect for the way her family — and the world — operates.

One more thing. The secretary of the club is Stacey McGill. That's the person who decides when our club members can sit. Stacey can't be a full-time member because she's in New York City (when she used to live with her dad), but that doesn't stop her from being a busy person. She's the alternate officer, which means she has to know the same amount of jobs as the rest of us.

You can tell that Stacey and her dad are very proud of their club. They consider it a brotherhood, a baby-sitting zoo, and a super team. Stacey is really funny and full of energy. You would not believe how dedicated she has been to the club. She practically runs the BSC. If I were to count my usual clients, I see nine. And believe me, there are eight more who come every other weekend to watch David Michael. (Nine is the number we gave up last year when Shannon's parents wanted her to stay in the East Village because Shannon's father's job had changed.)

Speaking of changes in the BSC, Dawn is taking over as vice-president of operations. Dawn wasn't at the meeting that day because she was out sick. But after we got over that, the meeting
