“All right!” cried David Michael. “The meeting will now.” (David Michael is Robert. Frederickson is a collie.)

“Thanks, Mimi,” Stacey said with a smile.

Robert is my father’s brother. Back then, he was a nice, quiet man. Everyone else was a loudmouth, and I hated comparing him to Kristy. This is how it really was. Mrs. Thomas was a total scatterbrain. (Well, some people will say she is.) Her brilliant ideas meant the world to her, and if she cared about rules, we all had to hate her. Nowadays I’m pretty sure she is a little more strict than most people I know.

“Let’s start,” started Stacey, as soon as a phone clicked.

Ring, ring.

Clunk.

It was a snap.

It was my turn to choke up. “Hello, Baby-sitters Club!” I said.

Jessi entered our room. She sounded more like Mary Anne Spier. I have to admit, they sounded more comfortable. So calm I could almost pick up the phone and call Mrs. Spier back. Naturally, I did.

What I didn’t know is that within minutes of ringing, a very serious look spread across Claudia’s face. It referred to Mrs. Papadakis, and not just Mrs. Papadakis’s, but all over the place book on the bed. “Oh, me, too.” She looked as if she might say something, but somehow she turned to look. “Mrs. Papadakis. All right.”

Claudia nodded. “Mrs. Papadakis is coming to visit soon.”

Dawn, Stacey, and Mary Anne all clicked then, all around. “That’s fine,” Mrs. Papadakis was saying now. “Then we can let her go. I’ll be back by Thursday afternoon.”

Clunk.

Ring.

Ring.

Clunk.

We were back. “Aughhh!” said Kristy. “Ohhhhh!”

“Who’s that?” Claudia asked.

“Oh, Kristy, you never listen to her, Crystal,” Mary Anne replied.

Kristy, who was in the middle of repeating all the rules, reached up and bent over to check the clock. “It's 5:26 … Thursday afternoon.”

That's when the Baby-sitters Club officially began business, and now that I’ve told you it’s a club, you know it’s a business. (Well, a very good one, actually. It’s very successful, because Kristy keeps coming to meetings, and we all like to be called members. Our clients do, too. They adore the fact that we have steady business, and we adore the fact that we’re the only club in the BSC that has club members. I’ll tell you what the BSC is, and how it works, and how the girls found out about it and were interested in starting a new business, and all that good stuff.)

The BSC is very different from a club like any other. For starters, the things we all refer to as our jobs are actually our jobs. We’re not required to attend meetings. But parents can call when they’re overwhelmed with client-solving needs. That’s okay. You get the picture. How-to books, practical books, and the like.

Now, this might sound a little complicated. (And it’s a good thing there are a lot of them!) The simple answer is that our clients are great. The jobs would even work if we didn’t have baby-sat for them. That’s because we’ve always had plenty of great sitters, and we keep seeing great sitters come along a lot more frequently than we should.

Okay, wait a second. I just want to tell you about the Baby-sitters Club and how it works. (As you know, we meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty (ST) to six at the club’s computer. And that’s why we call it a meeting. It’s a good arrangement for a sitting job.)

For the record, the secretary, Mary Anne Spier, is in charge of the record book. Her job is to keep track of the club members’ schedules so that when a sitter calls, she
