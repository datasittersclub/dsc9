�’�s bedroom. When the door to his room was inoperable, they used all kinds of unusual means to move in. First they built a new door across the hall from his. Then they put in the stairs and moved him into the bedroom. Finally they broke up the two main rooms, opened the front door to the bedroom, and opened the back. Then they opened the stairs and slid in again, so that the rest of us were in the main bedroom alone.

“We have the door,” Claudia said. “You’re going to have to open it,”

The two-legged sisters smiled. “Okay.”

“That’s wonderful,” Jessi replied. She went to her locker and squeezed open the door. “This is the entrance.”

“Oh, right,” Claudia said. The bell rang.

“And we’re open,” the sisters repeated.

That’s when I knew that Kristy and I were going to have to sit in that little mess in our little room. I took one last look at Jessi, who was perched on one shoulder, hands folded before her eyes, in the kitchen. “Can I have my salad?” she asked as she gulped down the sauce.

Kristy was wearing glasses, jeans, and an oversized white turtleneck sweater sweater. She’d been hiding under her sneakers when Jessi’s mom died, but she couldn’t tell. She’d just eaten some of the extra salad to forget about it. Anyway, it’s the one thing that’s unusual about Jessi. Not only are she a gorgeous girl, but she’s practically a queen. Jessi’s style is more sophisticated. She’s sleek, graceful, and athletic.

I realized as I opened the door, that Kristy and I were going to be in the same room every day. They’d never been that exact, but we’d been friends for awhile now. We’ve had a few fights. First, they made love, then they got divorced, then they decided they needed a new mom. They finally decided to get together again, which happened a few months later. Then they got married, and now they’re still friends. What were the reasons? Well, they’ve had one or both parents for months now.

That’s Kristy’s explanation. It’s because she’s an actual mother. There were times when she’d try hard to keep it a secret for her own kids. For instance, when she’s out shopping, one day she buys a bag of potato chips for Mary Anne’s family. That’s when someone else is upset by the bag, and Mary Anne tries to call the police (she’s the only one of us who hasn’t been). When they’re called, Mary Anne can usually find a sitting job.

Kristy’s job is pretty cool, I guess. She tries to be helpful and kind, but that’s all the fun they get out of living in a neighborhood that’s too small (a baby-sitting job!).

Kristy’s dad took care of the kids before he got married, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t try. It was just that while Dad was in California, he was trying to make some money. He paid for his mom’s plane tickets with gold coins, which were in the Kid-Kat Kids’ fund. Kid Kat is the oldest of four girls. When Dad got to California, he moved them to a beautiful farmhouse in California, one of the few places where kids didn’t have to wear anything. But Dad didn’t want the kids to go to a different school.

Kristy took the money and transferred them back to Dad. (We all had to go to college to be close friends.) But now he’s trying to find a new job. That’s when Kristy’s parents got very concerned.

So they tried to convince our parents to throw in another job, but they seemed to be out of luck. Kristy finally convinced her parents in January. That’s when she and her mom and Claudia came to live with their new friends. We were very glad. Well, they seemed to be happy.

Claudia and Mary Anne are the only four sisters in the family, so they’re the only two siblings (her mom is triplets, while Jessi and Mom are friends only). The other two kids, Anna and Stacey, live with their mom and Krist
