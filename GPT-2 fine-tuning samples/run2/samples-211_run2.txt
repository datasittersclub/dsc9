 air!” (Her parents call Claudia the Baby-sitter.)

“You know, you can say anything right now” Claudia said to Jessi, who was sitting on the floor. “No. No, Claudia says she’s going to get ready for the BSC office. But she’s getting ready for all the official meeting. I’m going to be here.”

“Guess who’s going to be answering that’s for sure? Jessi and Anna. I’m asking her, “What about the phone?”

“It’s Claudia’s office.”

“She’d give Kristy a call at once.”

“Kristy’s a big Kristy fan,” I said. “I guess,” I said with a smile. Then I added (with a gulp — a gulp that almost always brings tears) “You don’t have to sit for Kristy — what would Kristy do? Would he go crazy and call you back after you’re ready? Kristy would be really, really excited. I know it’s going to be hard to stick up for Kristy.

As you can tell, the conversation was running well, and Kristy was having a great time answering these questions. I glanced back at Claudia, who was perched on our bed.

“Hi,” I said quickly. “My name is Kristy Thomas. I’m eleven years old. I’m going to be going to Stoneybrook this coming Monday.” I began pointing a pencil at her. “Hi, Mrs. Thomas.”

Claudia looked like a movie star, which was the way I was used to being treated like a movie star. And I was treated to how the way that Kristy always treated me was treated.

But what she always did was treat everybody as if they were children, so that when Kristy came home from school, they could watch a movie in her room. She didn’t have any rules about what she’d get in a movie (and she definitely wasn’t strict about it) but she insisted on giving everyone the same movie — the one without the scary words “Hang on, Dad,” and “Claudia,” and “Baby-sitters Club. She even had another special idea for the title — “We’re going to change the title to “The Wild Wild West’”!

And that’s what all this was about. Kristy wanted the group called “The Wild West” to be a good reference (she was going to say this really just isn’t true — it wasn’t). And she was a big fan of Mary Anne, Jessi, Mallory, and Mary Anne, but the Wild West was a theme she thought would be really cool in all the movie movies that she could think of.

Claudia made no reference to “The Wild Wild West’ in the title. Her idea was exactly what all the other members were about — a history lesson, a history class, a history book, a History Channel show, a History Channel movie, a History Channel news station, an all-ages musical, and so on.

And, like all our meetings, we had our own “We’re going to change the title to “The Wild Wild West” pages. Claudia had already had that discussion, and made sure everyone knew about it. We decided at that point, though, not all meetings had such a good idea.

For me it was kind of a blur right away: “We’re going to do a movie about the Wild West?” I said.

“I’d better think of something different,” Kristy replied excitedly. “I mean, how big are all the children?”

“Well, Kristy, you do know plenty about the Wild West.”

“She has a bunch of stories,” I said. “You know all about her and what she’d gone through —” I explained — “like those books she’d read in kindergarten.” Kristy likes them, but she’s a real individual. She’s very sensitive — and just plain funny.

Kristy, on the other hand, likes very private things, like my drawings. I know that some people don’t like to draw, but I’m so glad I’m so young. I don’t know enough about the children in
