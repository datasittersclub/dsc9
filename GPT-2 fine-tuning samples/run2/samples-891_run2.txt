======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 create a club for the sickest kids. They work side by side with Claudia on homework, Claudia's parents on scheduling, and Claudia and Mary Anne keep each other company. It’s the most official position in the club. If Claudia and Kristy could get together this way, they could arrange for hands-on time with clients. (Claud, of course, is the club treasurer.) What do members do? Nothing, really. The only thing they do is read other people’s books and write about their lives. So why don’t they think up new projects? What if Stacey, Mary Anne, and Claudia had similar ideas? What if we could create something really cool for our charges — something fun for ourselves and the kids we sit for?

Kristy would be right about a lot of things. One, she’s the only one in the club that is convinced parents to tell their kids about these kinds of activities. 2.) She would like to see better lightbulbs for dealing with distracting things — such as Nancy Drew books and candy, and junk food and Twinkies and bagels — coming from hidden houses and off-leggings, from somebody’s house, at night, on the weekends, for years to come.

I’ve already told you a little about Mary Anne — how she’s smart, how she’s an artist, how much she likes to read, how long she and Kristy have been best friends, and a lot more. But I should know that when I met Mary Anne, I thought she was a spoiled brat. I always feel that way. She’s the opposite of me — a tomboy type, with big, curly brown hair and blue eyes.

Like Kristy, Mary Anne is shy. But unlike me, she’s a terrific friend. I suppose because of that shyness that she has a great sense of humor, and it’s because of that she feels a little guilty at times about people she likes to date.

Like me, Mary Anne is pretty short. She’s originally from Baltimore, and grew up fairly close to her father. Her mom died in a car accident when Mary Anne was a kid, and Mr. Spier was very protective of Mary Anne. But when her father realized how wrong he had been for that, he started seeing Mary Anne as a reliable baby-sitter. After the birth of Dawn Schafer, their soon-to-be-wife, that’s where Mary Anne met Jeff. Jeff and Mr. Spier (everyone knows them as the Schafers) were living in southern California at the time — the Anita Road, where Mary Anne’s mother and father once lived (they divorced in high school). That’s how the two of them became stepsisters.

Then, a week went by and Mary Anne was living in the same neighborhood with her mom and dad. Her mom died in a car accident when Mary Anne was only nine. Mr. Spier wasn’t thrilled with her appearance (she’s beautiful!), or with her appearance at large. He thought her hair was simply too short; Mary Anne was just plain loud and bossy (she wouldn’t stand around telling you to shut up) — and he was right.

After a lot of thought, school finally came around. And Mary Anne already had the best friend system in place for support. I think Mary Anne could run for president without doing anything — which, of course, would have some people saying she is a disaster (ecchi every day). But she won’t do it. She’s a very strong person. And she has a great sense of humor. Her jokes are off-kilter and insensitive. She even makes up bad puns to fool people. You hardly ever hear her make them into great work-in-progress music.

So it’s not a bad dream for Mary Anne to come to believe this! On the other hand, why not just make her idea a little more palatable? She’s got a crazy sense of humor — too much! She’s so full of it that when I see her in work she doesn’t seem to mind that she feels I’m not particularly impressive. Mary Anne isn’t snobby or attention-seeking, though. She’s just very, very laid-back.

The other BSC member, Stacey, would like to remain just that — a laid-back version of ourselves. We’re all, amazingly, as different as night and day. We love to surf, we love to shop, and we’re the clubgirls out. We’re different from the rest of us, but we’re all part of one amazing group — the baby-sitters Club.
