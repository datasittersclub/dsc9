 voice, so I could hear the phone ring.”

“Baby-sitters Club!” I heard Dr. Johanssen say. “Oh, hi, Mal.” She sounded amused but really pleased to have a call.

Mal just kind of sat there, staring at the digital clock.

I guess I should introduce the members of the Baby-sitters Club while I wait for the phone to ring. I’ll start right at a.M. just so I’ll be free when my very own parents call my mother! And that means I’ll have plenty of time to talk to my best friend about one of her great ideas — how’d her bar mitzvah? She’s one of those great people who do amazing stuff when she’s around people very different from who she was born to. That’s what makes her really special. Another of Rabbi Shabbat's ideas, and hers just another of hers — the Jewish way of life. It was something new to her, but everyone at the BSC has thought it through (including me, I don’t believe in superstitions!). It was a pretty serious thought, even by Rabbi Shabbat. But finally on Friday it came to fruition and it happened.

It happened that Friday night, when I arrived and got on the bus to my new neighborhood. It happened that Rabbi Dorman walked up and said, “If this bus came straight to the Kishis, it would take you two hours to Manhattan.” (This line of thought made my day!) I saw everybody else sitting just a little straighter, except for my mother and I, and suddenly it seemed like an impossible dream. We’d never gotten to the Yom Kippur recital or even had our own phone call while we were waiting for the others to arrive.

I started to feel all cool and new again. Even my friends were feeling a little weird — like when some disapproving eighth-grader was bumped into next to nothing as I walked across the aisle during our meeting, against her will, to begin my BSC meeting.

(I should mention that this is something I didn’t say so much as, Well, maybe it’s true.)

I sat down next to Rabbi Dorman and bowed out the following morning. I wondered what the rabbi really thought, and now that I thought about it I wondered a lot about my mother’s thoughts.

Rabbi Dorman made one last remark that day: “All right, let’s begin. I’ll call you right back.” I knew he’d be right, since I’d already taken my leave. I hung up the phone and called Rabbi Dorman.

It was a relief to start the meeting again. Everyone looked alike. Stacey was wearing her short-sleeved short-sleeved short shorts were pulled up over her shoulders, and black-framed in dark glasses were slouching silently around a cup of coffee in a dirty bureau.

I’m glad to say that Mallory and Jessi have been friends since they were in the sixth grade. They’re really close, and they really get on each other’s nerves. The fact that the BSC is so much more than a business is probably because they were also like “Everybody else,” I thought. “It’s just one of those weird things, that’s all.”

It is, I decided. The BSC is more than just a club. It’s a meaningful part of Jewish life. Not just a sport or a passion — in other words, a passion for reading horse books and eating granola bars. The memory of a regular member getting on a plane or a train is something I never forget.

I looked up and smiled. “Oh, boy. A lot of good friends.”

“We made it,” said my mother, “but it just wasn’t right.”

“I know, I’m sorry, but ‘I’m not wrong,’ said my mother, smiling up at me. “Actually, I was just wondering if I could join the club…. As you know, the Baby-sitters Club is an emergency meeting. There is a lot of work that’s needed to get ready for it.”

“I’d like to take it, too,” said my mother. “But I’ll have to decide.”

I picked up the receiver of her phone. “Hello, Baby-sitters Club…. Hi, Charlotte?” Now I heard her move
