 especially as long as they don’t come with their dogs, or their cat, or their baby-sitting charges. Or they are not allowed to bring their junk food into the Kishis’, and just about everyone else in our club has some sort of sugar-free alternative. (See, Stacey used to be her sweetie, but now she’s not that sweet — it’s just a mystery. That’s because her dad died when she was little, and her mom never gave her plenty of sugar-free treats, like pretzels, or fruits, or candy, or something.) Fortunately, this is a problem now, and Stacey is taking steps to make it better. Stacey lives in a converted mansion, by the way, with her parents, her best friend Mary Anne Spier and her boyfriend, Adam Scott, and a pet hamster named Pete. He always takes his own pet, an equine named Lacey.

Stacey’s not the only animal to have some form of junk food. Her family has two pets — a rat and a cat, a long-distance cat and a puppy, and a goldfish, an even bigger animal, a gigantic goldfish. Stacey’s mom bought the goldfish from a thrift shop, and the hamster has no idea her family is going through all the shopping. In fact, it is so large and complicated that it almost looks pretty disgusting (in the kitchen, of course). That’s because Stace’s aunt visits frequently, and all you have to do to make sure you have the right pets seems to be having fun.

Stacey has lived next door to the Brewer's until recently, and she and Kristy thought they were neighbors, but they soon found out that their neighbor, Claudia Kishi, actually practices Japanese-American fashion (especially on the dark side). Stace can hardly stand the idea of Claudia buying a new pair of jeans from a thrift store for one of the black, long-sleeve shorts she’d bought with her mother’s money, and then ripping off the jeans and buying new colors of sweats. She still goes around, but she’s far more casual in her looks. In fact, her mother died when Stace, her father and her younger brother, Scott, were little.

So, Stacey had to step in, even though she had her own private school and after-school program. It’s kind of tough being a junior member in that way sometimes, but I think I did a lot of good, and her best friend, Maggie Gyllenhaal, was a good member too (even though Stace was a little too shy to say thank you for the gifts she tried to give us). Finally, after Mary Anne’s death, Stacey decided to try to raise a little cash for Ramona and help her grandmother, Nannie and Andrew, who have their own private hospital and other supplies for the poor.

Maybe that was the beginning of my love for Stacey. I thought she could be a good president. At one point she was on the debate team at a debate in which President McGloin had given the impression that she and President Brewer (who is her best friend) were running around with long, stinking, glittering hats. Then I realized her big mouth was part of what had made her the president of the BSC. Well, let me tell you about her and how she became president because, as we all knew, she is incredibly shy. (Okay, so maybe you should tell about me, since I’m in awe of anyone, whether you’ve ever met a great-aunt or a great-aunt or a great-sibling. But anyway, I don’t want to spoil a bad night by saying this, or that, or nothing at all, because this is mostly about her. I mean, like, I’m in awe of all the people who live in my house and befriend them and have wonderful times. But I’m also in awe of the people I make phone calls to, when I need help … or when I need money. See, Stace loves to take care of herself, and when she does, she is very caring and caring about the little she has left over from her many fights with her father and from the pain her mother has had. She has to think of all kinds of wonderful things for herself, of the things that can be learned and taken care of and things that can just be learned. The more she practices that art, the more she is probably going to be the person who can really bring out the other little qualities in a person. When I was younger, I wanted to be a ballet dancer, so that meant I had to have practice a lot, and I had to be perfect in every single way. At this stage,
