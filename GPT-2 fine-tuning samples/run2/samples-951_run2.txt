 and a very nice guy). Mr. Thomas is an associate member of the BSC, so his job is to keep an eye on the club record book, which consists of a calendar, a client list, a notebook, and a notebook on how to pay Charlie to drive me to meetings.

The notebook is where the rest of us are recorded — in our record book at the beginning of each meeting — so that we all know what's going on with our clients. The notebook is very helpful, though. As I got to know Shannon, I realized that the entire club was writing and discussing the best way to spend money, and that the club was really a slumber party — a lot of fun, but with its own problems, too.

The notebook also contains helpful hints as to what's wrong with those bad habits and how to fix them.

The notebook is my "escape route" to the city. It was Kristy's idea, and she's had the Clutter Boys — or at least some of them — on other occasions. When we were in the smallish Stoneybrook neighborhood around eighth grade, Dawn, Sharon, Mary Anne, and I lived across the street from Claudia Kishi, on Claudia's great-aunt, Nannie. So we grew up together. But Sharon and Nannie weren't exactly in and of themselves. Sharon and Nannie weren't exactly in charge of hospitality, either. Her idea of it was, “Have a cup of tea with Mrs. Kishi, just to roll out a tray of Charms and have someone else serve the food.” But that afternoon, Dawn came into the kitchen and heated up a couple of castaways — Dawn and her younger brother, Jeff. Her assistant, Mary Anne, took another hot meal.

Mary Anne, who has pale skin and red hair, was sitting on the bed, her glasses out, and a piece of paper stuck up her back. Claudia, who has blonde hair and perfect skin and nails, was gazing out the window, which was covered with blonde casseroles.

The Kishis are regular clients. (No, I'm not the BSC vice-president. In fact, I don't have much official position in the BSC, since I'm vice-president.) Claudia, who has her own private phone line (and the only private number in Stoneybrook, which is the sister of one of our associate members), is almost always around for our meetings. She seems to have had no problem dispensing these nice, casual hello to all our sitting clients.

As far as Claudia goes, the Kishi line is the best. It’s the shortest, and it has the most reliable (and highest-quality) lines. The only problem? That’s where Claudia Kishi stands. She is the president of the BSC, and she controls that great. Nowadays she’s in charge of everything. (She doesn’t have many official duties, but she does take charge of the record book, where she records our sitting clients’ names and addresses, all the way down to the last BSC member.)

I looked around Claudia’s room. The walls were white, the carpet pink, and the ceiling was covered with Claud’s art supplies. Even the junk food was out of the way. It’s almost as if Mallory Pike is having brainwashing herself. All she does is look cool. And to her, is so-and-so. She complains that Claud’s hair is “blonde.” I guess this is a sort of curse, or at least a condition where she can’t look her hair out — or draw attention to herself.

The picture on the wall read, in part, “Anastasia Elizabeth I’s body” (Is that what you call it, from the pits of your stomach?) and “I have never once tasted a pea before’ .” So, Claudia was probably the most exotic looking BSC member of all time. At 5:31 she started to look younger and a little werierf, but she’s not, as some would say, a California girl. She’s a California girl now. You see, after seven years in the land of California girls, Claudia now dresses a little like a prima donna (natural-girl uniformed). She has long black hair, dark, almond-shaped eyes (she’s Japanese-American), and a fantastic smile.

She has blonde high-end clothes style (almost) her age. And she buys her hair in the long, gorgeous group of braids she adorns. I guess natural beauty goes away with age, so naturally and gracefully Claud is dressed. Her parents, on the other hand, disapprove of her growing up. They think she should only wear jeans and turt
