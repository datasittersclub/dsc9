 had had a steady boyfriend, I think we used to call our names on him. “That’s what a good mother tries to tell me about.”

“Well,” Kristy said. “Let’s begin with Mr. and Mrs. Newton. Mrs. Newton’s family has been involved in a lot of things this week. We have a new baby brother, Sam, and new friends, plus a new sister, Janine, and a baby brother, David Michael. Mrs. Newton’s always been a very involved parent, and I guess she takes baby-sitting seriously.” Kristy nodded.

“All the charges have been settled,” Kristy continued. “I have two associate members and two associates. We’re not going on the trial.”

I nodded. “What I mean is, no charges have been laid.” I told Mr. Newton that our friends would go to trial without any charges laid. “No charges have been laid. We don’t mean anything by a trial.”

“Kristy, I’m not prejudging,” said Dawn. She glanced down at the notebook in which she had recently written. “I think we’re lucky that the charges are not laid yet. We’re waiting on our new baby, the baby of the day. I’m glad you’re still having fun with Charlie (David Michael), but I think you were doing everything right at the beginning.”

“But I’m not going to be a little bit wild.”

“I’m not wild.” Kristy's voice was calm, even calm. She put the notebook down and looked at me with a curious expression. “If nothing else, I can’t wait to do Charlie,” she said, closing the journal.

“Okay,” I said as I grabbed Dawn’s clipboard. “And I can’t wait. And Dawn, you know, we have a lot in the way of business,” I explained. “It’ll just be the start of what we’ll call the trial.”

“Good business,” Dawn answered, as if we had to speak in one sentence. “Now, Dawn and I, you know what? If Charlie was sick, we don’t want us to take the baby. But we can wait.”

“Okay,” Dawn said, “that’s okay,” she said. “Baby-sitting is just fine, though. If Charlie had a problem, or if Mr. Newton couldn’t solve the problem, and he didn’t tell our friends, then we might go on trial, but we’re not going that far.”

“Well,” Kristy started, “now we have another big case in the trial.”

I watched Kristy turn to David Michael, who spoke slowly and with some reluctance as he reached across the table and squeezed Dawn’s hand.

“I have no other business.”

“I have to leave before it’s too late,” Dawn said.

The last member of our club to arrive was the man in the notebook. “Hello, Charlie,” I said, just as David Michael and Janine were leaving the room.

David Michael said as he went to his desk, “I had the case,” he began, “which is a double story. The first is “Ace of Spades from the Saddle to the Moon,” and the other’s, “Ace of Tigger from the Saddle to the Moon,” The two stories were almost identical. There was no mention of a special art form, art, or art, which is what we all do. We call them arts.

We all looked at David Michael. His ears gleamed. (He’s been doing art since before I’d met him.) He was wearing a white jumpsuit, a black T-shirt, button-down black shirt, red tie tie, and tie-dyed white slippers. He’d just finished up a glass of milk and a box of Doritos. “It’s a triple story,” he admitted, pausing at the top for our big jump.

“No need to go there,” Kristy said again, “but I think I’ll have time.”

“Hi, Charlie,” Janine said
