======== SAMPLE 1 ========
, we have six dogs. The oldest of them, a Labrador named Shannon, is a puppy. The younger dog is Watson. He's cute, quiet, funny. Karen, Watson's two kids from his previous marriage, live at the house at least part of the time. Watson and Karen are fanatics. They visit the movies three times a week, read horse books, and’s, bookstores, or check out Karen’s art projects. Watson isn’t much of a junk food fanatic. But he knows Karen, and knows the history of every single member of the BSC, so he makes good friends with all of us except Kristy and Mary Anne. (What he doesn’t know is that Stacey is the only one of us who actually practices for hours.)

Watson’s the only member of the BSC who absolutely adores Karen and rides her scooter around town on crutches, like Kristy, but makes an exception whenever she visits a crime. For example, the Pikes are Watson’s other close friend. That’s because they’ve known each other practically forever. Watson is an associate member of the club. He doesn’t come to meetings much, except for a few short sitting jobs, but he helps out whenever we need jobs. Karen's job, for example, is to keep an eye on things. Watson’s job is going over all the Kid-Kits at the BSC, so when a call comes in, it’s easy to see who’s available.

Watson’s also a fairly steady jobsewer. I’m not kidding. He’s the most recent member of the BSC, and she’s the youngest. She came of age in the seventh grade when her mom was married again. Watson’s not into getting stuck-up like my dad, but now she has some stepsiblings (Karen, a toddler), a stepbrother named Jeff, a stepparent named Karen, a stepsister named Dawn, a stepsister named Marnie, and four kids.

Watson is also nice with kids, and he’s pretty sure of himself. Not only does he keep a record book in which he writes up every job, but he also keeps an updated client list, including addresses, phone numbers, hourly rates, and any special information about the kids, such as who’s on which sitting charges. In addition to being nice and neat, he’s also pretty good with the kids. At times, he even makes them laugh. Even when he could be a good baby-sitter (he’s the only one in the club who could be), he’s quite sad when a sad child comes along.

Now, let me explain what Kristy, Mary Anne, and I are like. We were the first baby-sitters of the BSC when I was little. Our parents worked long hours for both of us (we got two brothers and three-and-a-half-year-olds every other weekend) and were worried about the amount of work that would be needed to keep the club running smoothly. Well, something went terribly wrong that afternoon. One night Kristy’s mom, Sharon, was in a panic over Buddy, Buddy, and Byron. When Sharon called to tell her that they were going to need help, they all started running down the hall together.

It took some doing, but by the time Sharon finally managed to get a sitter for her own younger brother, Charlie, she had seven excellent baby-sitters.

I think this is the truth. Of all the BSC members, only Dawn is truly famous, even though she sometimes refers to us as her Baby-sitters. We have lots of honorary members, mainly because we have a lot of regular clients. Like all of us, Dawn has a real boyfriend, Logan Bruno, who’s super-interested in girls. (Boy, does Valentine's Day always come sooner than the next day!)

Dawn has a wild sense of humor. She used to call me, but I just let it go right by. She’s always having bad days.

Anyway, Dawn and I have a lot in common. The first thing is that we're both petite, which is not unusual with us at all. She’s the shortest of five siblings. Second is Logan (yes, the only one of us to walk on three toes), which is a nickname that comes to us naturally. He’s really nice. Anyway, the second thing is that we’re pretty alike in a lot of ways. For example, we’re both the oldest kid in our families. Really, we both want to be. We even have our own kind of favorite movie. But we’re pretty
