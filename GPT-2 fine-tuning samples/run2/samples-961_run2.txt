 you can take them to the doctor tomorrow,” said Mary Anne Spier.

“Good idea,” said Logan. “I guess I should try offering the pill tomorrow. Maybe the Baby-sitters Club can meet for a little bit.”

Claudia looked around the room. “What?”

Mary Anne Spier looks like a patient. She has long black hair (cut in half in half then flaked back to one ear) and brown eyes. She has a pretty face and she’s kind of a talker. She’s not a big talker. You might recognize her from TV shows such as Louie or T.I.

Claudia is the vice-president of the club. She hosts the meetings and gives us her honest opinion about the kids we baby-sit for.

“I have some news,” said Claudia, folding the brochure in her fist. “My dues will cover the bills of the museum and take care of some new art supplies. Thanks, Muzz.”

Maggie Blume, Claudia’s dog, tugs on a sneer of surprise at Claudia’s facial expression. Mal dances under her mattress since she lives on the floor.

Claudia sighs and starts jumping up and down. “Your dues will cover the cost of repair suits, and of course we need to hire a private tutor for our English major.”

“Yeah,” replied Mal. (When I mentioned the English major, I got really angry.)

The five of us shook our heads and we sat down. Mary Anne opened the brochure to find a Valentine card tucked away in a special pocket in the back.

“Uh-oh?” she asked.

“Yes,” replied Logan.

The Valentine card prompted everyone to take out a generous amount of their money. Mallory hit the hay.

“Swift as this Valentine card was,” she whispered. (Surprised?)

Then Logan and Mary Anne started tossing and turning. I was really looking forward to spending some time with Logan and Mary Anne. Of course, spending time with Logan and Mary Anne wasn’t the only time I’d been spending with them. Besides, I wouldn’t mind spending time with Logan and Mary Anne and I couldn’t wait to see them together.

The meeting ended then and I said good-bye to everyone.<|endoftext|>
“What on earth is wrong with me?” someone commented.

“I made a big mistake.”

The director of the BSC had just called my sister and showed her the slip of paper that he had made — in plain English, I guess.

“Josh,” said Kristy Thomas, “did you open the package yet?”

The BSC record book was open for business. We all began writing and counting and moving things.

Maybe I should start by telling you about Josh and his family and show you how they look at my family.

For example, how do I define good and family?” You might ask Kristy. Well, I think good means having a good friend. There are a lot of good friends in the BSC. My closest one is Mal, whose name is almost always on the roster. There are also Logan, who is shy and has a big mouth, and Shannon, who comes from a huge family. You name it, I can name them.

But in all of my relationships, I have only one good friend — and one bad one —” Kristy began, before she had a mouthful of red meat.

“Okay,” began Kristy. “We have to start celebrating, aren’t we?”

I started to wipe my eyes with a fistful of corn syrup.

“Thanks,” said Kristy. “Guess who we celebrate with.”

“Ew, I guess,” said a giggle, and Claudia broke into tears.

“Aaaaaugh!” the room was deafening.

Luckily, Jessi rushed in to help.

Jessi is a serious ballet student. She takes lessons at a dance school in Stamford, Connecticut. And she’s adorable. She’s the most talented person I know — and I mean talented. She takes lessons at a school in California every week and she’s already danced big crowds at these shows. (She has pale skin and black hair and I think she thinks it’s because she just started using makeup.) Jessi grew
