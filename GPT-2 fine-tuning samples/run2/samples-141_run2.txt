======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 downtown to one of the clubs. She said that one of the things she hated about school and the BSC was that kids would take their assignments for them. Well, they used to. It's pretty much not true anymore — even the Krushers are pretty slow.

I could see where I might live. The club I grew up in would almost certainly be the one I had to move to, after all those years.

"Well, I guess I won't have to," I sang after the ceremony.

"I did! I guess so."

I pulled a small box into my lap. It was all wrapped up in a brown pad, and in gold foil. I took it in my right hand and held it like a record book. The tape was folded up inside.

"I've been told by an associate that you should stay away from the city, too, unless you're going to be attending some private service during Christmas. We haven't booked that yet."

"Mmm … okay," I answered, taking out my notebook. "I'll check —" I paused and opened the notebook, checking that I wouldn't notice anything about you.

"That leaves the city and the club," another associate said. "Do you think you'll make it?"

"I'll check," I said.

The associate shrugged. "I'm going to stick to my schedule on the club bus. There's plenty to do during the holidays. I'm sure they'll take you there. But I'll take it."

I took the notebook and closed my mouth.

I walked into the club. I was in no mood to talk. I hadn't noticed. But I recognized the voice of Claudia Kishi, who was sitting at her desk, and I could feel my excitement. We've been friends all this time, so I knew I had to be nice to her.

Claudia had just called me, to tell me her new baby-sitting job, which includes reading Karen’s The Way of Tomorrow. She was excited, too, because she is.

Our alternate officer in charge, Shannon Kilbourne, was there to monitor our schedules. I thought it might be a good idea for us to keep track of all our charges so they wouldn’t break into our meetings to check on our schedules.

"I'll see you to my office," said Shannon with a wince, before we both closed the notebook and walked out.

"No idea how long?" I asked. I wasn’t sure I could answer. (I probably should have used “the New York Times’s” reliable number.)

A short while later …

Shannon and I sat down on the floor next to each other. She was grinning. She is my new best friend and she likes talking about all her friends! For a while, I thought I’d be a little nervous.

I’d been working up that feeling thinking I’d be too nervous. Maybe I should just leave the room — I’d never want to be somewhere I wouldn’t be a few minutes after they’d hit the floor. Shannon always makes me feel like you can’t sit there when I’m out with my Dad. I try to wear jeans and a T-shirt that is too bright. I’ve found that my jeans are too dark and I never know when I’m going to wear them again. I’re lucky — my friend Shannon is just so beautiful. I don’t often think of myself that way. I know when I’m going to be wearing jeans or shirt-and-sleeves, my jeans are going to be the worst-case version of theirs. I mean, the clothes are too dark. Too much denim in a red color and too little cotton. I could easily wear jeans instead of shirt. No one could wear this outfit.

When Shannon and I first met, the other kids in that school seemed very surprised. Shannon was the younger one, so you’d be surprised by the way she looked at what she was wearing. And you wouldn’t be surprised at how much she’d grown.

That’s not to say Shannon isn’t super-smart. She doesn’t look it. She has long, curly blonde hair and a deep brown complexion. Her skin is so reddish-brown that you would never mistake it for any other color. Shannon and I are similar in a way — both know their environment, both like to read and write about health of the earth, and both like the idea of growing an apple tree after every meal.

So I’ve told you about a few of the things that Shannon does that I think are not really a big deal.
