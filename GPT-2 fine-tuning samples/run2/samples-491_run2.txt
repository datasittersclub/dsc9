. In fact, the reason Claudia’s in Stoneybrook, the rest of us are there because it’s their first meeting. Why is that important? I’ll never know, but for some reason I think it’s important.

Mary Anne’s home may be Stoneybrook’s Mary Anne. But that’s not the only important thing about Mary Anne. After I moved to Connecticut from California, I became friends with her family. It also changed how I lived with my father. It became much more complicated. For instance, one afternoon Mary Anne fell in love several places before the marriage. And while she and her father and her mother were in love, the Thomases were living upstairs from Mr. Mercer. Then, a year and a half ago, Mary Anne and her father got married.

So you only have half the answers to Mary Anne’s question and half of the reasons, but I guess you’ll find the ones I didn’t already.

Here’s what I couldn’t figure out: the first thing I did was look around at the BSC record book. (It’s in my father’s desk somewhere.) The record book, I’m sure you know about, is a set of instructions and other written information. It says what to do, who to baby-sit for, and how to fill out job assignments. I also have to check to make sure I have any new baby-sitting material on hand.

Of course, I wasn’t at the meetings in the office with any new baby-sitting material — only a couple of old flyers, and the word "mansion" in one of them. But that didn’t seem to be a big deal, and it stopped bothering me very much when the flyers were filled with new information as well as a description of how and when to sit for the kids. (By the way, we always take great care to keep the record book up to date! If you have any information about a sitting job, call Kristy at the next meeting.)

Claudia was next best with Mary Anne. She was sitting on her bed, looking at a stack of Baby-sitters.

Abby and her twin sister, Karen, were sitting on the floor.

"Who’s this?" Abby exclaimed. Babies are usually pretty quiet, unless you're playing the radio and having a big conversation.

"You know what?" asked Karen.

"I’m sorry, I’m not in a mood."

Karen shrugged.

"What ’are you talking to someone new here?" asked Abby.

"What in ’new here?” I said.

Abby was shocked, but she sat there for a moment. I guess the idea sounded as if it might be a little immature. I mean, we’ve never sat in front of a TV channel for hours and gotten anywhere. But it was just as funny.

It was so funny to see Abby, who’s quiet in particular, beaming at the idea. She checked her watch. Then she turned and grinned.

“This meeting will come to order,” she said. “Thanks so much for listening.”

“Thanks a lot,” said Logan.

“Well, you know what the next meeting will be, Kristy, I’m about to call this meeting about your job.”

“What job, anyway?” Kristy asked.

“I’d like to baby-sit for the kids, but maybe I can’t find out until I’m older, Kristy.”

“Are we sure?” I raised my eyebrows.

Kristy looked slightly interested, though. It was the first time I’d called her about a job. She didn’t answer, although she tried. Even Claudia, the assistant who answered the phone, didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

She answered. “I’m sorry I had to come down here. We’ve got plenty of work to do. I can’t sit for the BSC for very long. It would be a disaster for the neighborhood.”

As Kristy spoke, the lights of Claudia’s BSC lighted up the room.

“That’s okay, Claudia,” Kristy insisted. “Everyone knows we have a central phone number in the city. You don’t have to call us, but that’s okay. We’ll just call ourselves Baby-sitters Club and we’ll call anyone and
