 floor, and I ‘ve been doing the job for hours. It’s been fun to work with.”

“That’s amazing,” Jessi added.

“Do you know how many steps you take?” I asked.

“Yikes.” Claud finished.

“That’s good,” Abby suggested.

I wasn’t so sure. When the BSC was formed, it was basically a baby-sitting business. Kristy didn’t want to baby-sit for free for a very long time. It was like trying to keep your job. She thought that you didn’t have lots of opportunities to try to get a sitter. She also thought that if you had more work than you could handle, then you would lose your job — for example, if a client calls you to tell you that a baby-sitting job has been transferred to another office. It sounds stupid, although it is. (I am a big fan of the BSC. I’m thirteen.)

What Kristy decided to do was brilliant. At the same time, she had chosen a totally different person for the job. Someone who was not a baby-sitter. Someone who didn’t have a steady phone line, who wasn’t particularly interested in baby-sitting, and who took a long time for herself and her family to settle into. When it did, it was very satisfying.

It was another great coincidence. Kristy always dreamed up jobs for herself, and she even dreamed up the BSC. I think the idea came to her in a big way. One day, she thought up the idea of how the BSC works. It came to her on that day when she and her mom and dad were in a meeting. Mrs. Thomas wanted to know how all of Kristy’s best friends knew each other. That was when Kristy and her mom were talking. Kristy said to her, “Kristy, I have this idea.”

She said “I can make a special booth at a restaurant or a movie theater and everyone will sit. Then I’d have a booth with seating at every restaurant or theater I go to. And I could do the booth at the rate I’d pay, so all of us would be able to sit and play our favorite sports such as football, baseball, track.”

Kristy didn’t mean that. She meant that it would be an event.

I was surprised that Kristy thought, because the moment she asked, the idea fizzled out. She thought, well, I could probably do that. Why didn’t I want to attend an event? Why didn’t I want to attend the BSC at what’s supposed to be a regular time? Well, for starters, Kristy thought I’d be too busy. I’d look like a crank. You’d want a little more time to play sports.

I think the Krushers are a good example of a company that has the best ideas and the best stores. I’m sure they have plenty of business. It’s like saying, “The Krushers can pay people to come visit, so why don’t they sell pizza to me every Sunday (well, I guess I don’t want that, but I’ll figure it out,”).

Maybe if we all could get together and make some awesome ideas, the BSC would work.

“Yikes!” Stacey said with a smile. “What good are some pizza-weezers?”<|endoftext|>
Monday would have been a big hit for Kristy, the first time I went to the movies. She had spent all her time in my room during the previous week. I knew her best way around it because she’s the shortest person in the world. But I liked Kristy more than she liked me. My parents love Kristy, but I felt like they wanted to pry the secret out from us all over the place.

It was an even bigger deal for all of us with my parents. They wanted to make sure I didn’t have to move home during the summer. Plus, the idea of moving into an apartment with my mom and Kristy was one of the coolest. But as things stand, I hardly ever go to the movies.

I’m now allowed a private phone line to get to our meetings. I’m very proud of the fact that I have the best time with kids, since I have the best ears and I can tell when Mom (who goes to the same school) and Dad (who goes to Stoney
