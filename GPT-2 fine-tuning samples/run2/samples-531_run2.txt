 moved to a new house and moved across town to Stoneybrook. He was thrilled when she finally moved out. She had grown up in New York City, so New York was her home and her hometown.

“Let’s see, I do have this house I wish I lived in in Stoneybrook,” Stacey had promised.

“Okay!” Dawn spoke up from her couch. “I have an idea.”

The car pulled up. “Hey, this is Kristy,” she said. “She’s the only one who knows my family's history. You know … maybe we could tie a company record book and go to her house and see my family records. The record book is a notebook —”

“Who would love that?” Kristy asked. Kristy Thomas is an associate BSC member and she’s a favorite of my parents.

“I’d love the idea,” Mimi told me. “But then I’d have to do the homework. I mean, I would see what my dad’s schedule is like. I’d love to see the records. The way to tying the record book together would be with two people’s names and addresses. I would write them down and record them. That would be fun. And all the way from six to nine I might be able to take the job. But I wouldn’t know the person or things when I saw them. And all the names would tell me who was most likely to be the sitter.”

We talked for a little while longer. Then Kristy said, “I could tie the record book together,” “and the addresses would be listed in the notebook. I’d like to begin the job in the house where I’m staying. Or maybe in the bedroom where I keep Kristy Thomas. A person would enter names from a list that I know.”

Dawn laughed. “You’re joking. That’s just the way I’d do the job. Or I could tie the record book to the house for which I’d be working, as you say.”

“What if?" Stacey wondered aloud. “If the record book had a name?”

“What if, then? ” I said. “I don’t even know my family name.”

“What if the record book didn’t even exist?” Stacey asked.

“Oh, no. The records don’t exist.”

“That is … that’s awful. See, I know her parents don’t want me to be a baby-sitter, but it doesn’t make any sense. What if we could tie up the record book? Or maybe we’re doing a job, like my mother,” she added, “who cares. I’d like to have a baby-sitter at my parents house. Right? Well, I’ll see what the deal is. If I don’t want it, fine. But I wouldn’t want to part with my life. I wouldn’t pay that much money. I think I could be pretty interesting with a baby-sitting job, if I could find someone who liked baby-sitting assignments.”

“Can you imagine?” I asked. “I’d love to sit for that guy the way I do your grandmother. Or my parents? I would love to sit for someone, you know. And boy, I’d do it.”

Kristy’s expression softened slightly. “Of course I would. I just don’t feel comfortable tying up things with your grandmother, you know.”

“What kind of role would you be?” Dawn asked. “Hey, I would have a new girl to sit for Kristy….”

“All right.”

We sat there while Kristy sketched a perfect woman, Mary Anne Spier. We were looking at her very closely. I knew she’s already beginning sketches, and I knew she’d done all of them before. After we left the house, she stopped making drawings; she was drawing on a piece of paper, with a marker stuck to the back of her hand.

Mary Anne looks exactly the same to me, only different. She’s outgoing, sweet, sensitive, independent, sensitive; she’s on the short side. On that side she’s usually dressed for school activities or for ballet or
