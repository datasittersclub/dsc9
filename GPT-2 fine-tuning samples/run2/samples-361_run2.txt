======== SAMPLE 1 ========

A lot of the time, Kristy doesn’t come to meetings. She likes to be at home with her friends and is involved with several of our charges, such as Claudia’s art lessons. (She took remedial courses at Stoneybrook Community College and was invited to the BSC.) Kristy does a good job of being a regular member, if not the BSC’s regular member. And she’s always full of ideas and is a great listener and person. Like most of the rest of us, she’s diabetic (as you already know, I’m about the most sophisticated), with a condition called insulin-resistant, or RSC, which means her blood sugar is incredibly high (it’s almost impossible to eat alone) and she has to be extremely careful about what she eats, except for what’s in her blood. She has to give herself shots every day of this stuff called insulin, and she has to give herself shots of the stuff every single day (I should mention that in the past week or so I’ve been receiving good advice from my dentist about how to keep her dentist-observant appointment up to date). Oh, and, even though her family’s a little wary of her, she’s a great friend. If you have any questions, I’m really glad to be in this job. I’m the only person in the club who has the most incredible talent — even though our charges hate us, we have to keep each other informed of our charges’ openings, our jobs, and their hopes of winning awards and doing things we want to do. And we all have one thing in common — we’re both incredibly smart.

Claudia is our president. She’s very neat, and she is totally laid back. She wears really cool clothes, keeps her hair in pigtails, keeps it short, and is always in her finest possible shape — if not even in her best possible shape — all the time. She has this super-sweet, creamy, cocoa-covered body, perfect skin, a creamy, creamy complexion with lots of pigments, and the fact that she’s an animal. And her mind is a dolphin — she tries to make herself happy whenever possible, and when not she can be a dolphin in the best way possible — by thinking and acting out. She tries to make herself feel good, and she’s really good at that.

Claudia and Kristy are best friends (and very different), but they’re also very different in many ways. For one thing, Claud is white and not very elegant. (Her clothes are less trendy because she’s black, and she’s more conservative: her clothes are much more refined.) Claud lives practically across the street from Kristy, and for a long time her parents married. That’s where the similarities end. Claud’s father got remarried, and when she was a little boy her mother was the first one of her own. His name was, of course, Watson Brewer. And he had to make some tough choices, but he paid the bills and did fine. And his friends were happy, because he was a really good student. They liked him, though they didn’t like Claud very much, because they were all so mad that they didn’t invite him back to live with them. (They decided to go on a dates thing: Watson had once been a neighbor of Claud’s; now his friends call him Claud.) So he chose the city where Kristy grew up, and I believe she likes New York City. She also grew up in New York. (I was lucky to be born there, and I grew up over there.)

Lately Claud is busy with her art. She paints, draws, sculpts, makes jewelry, and sometimes makes a box complete with a drawer. She paints, draws, sculpture, and usually hangs her stuff all over the place in places where nobody else is around. Claud’s parents are divorced, and her dad lives in California. So she’s very close to him and stays far away from Stoneybrook, especially Mr. Mal. (She visits him as often as she can, but sometimes her parents don’t approve of the whole commute.) So her dad’s house is very crowded, but Claud is not afraid of it. When he needed her or wanted to talk to her, she would listen to him. She’s always doing well. (If she hadn’t grown up in New York, she’d probably be talking to Richard in a hospital now. And she’s still a little used to the city, especially in terms of clothes. And then she’s going to live in the new neighborhood. She’s never had to live on Long
