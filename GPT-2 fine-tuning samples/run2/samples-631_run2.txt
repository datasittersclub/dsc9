 into the treasury.) He collects dues the day after every meeting (he's in the treasury for our dues; she finances the rest of our expenses). If we have more money in the treasury, he'll also collect the dues if nones the case. Then, if there's enough money left over, he'll take out new money for our club, or for fun stuff such as our Krushers or something.

Mr. Thomas is also very laid-back. He does a great job of keeping the club record book in order and up-to-date. We always keep track of all our conflicts — paying our bills, going to the movies, buying new things, and buying new clothes. Plus, we also update the club notebook, where we each write up every single thing that happens on every job.

So yes, I am a pretty laid-back person. But it doesn't hurt to have someone in charge who understands that most of the things we take on can be pretty overwhelming.

Mary Anne is like that too. She's a total joker, loves sports, and always has been. Her dad left the family when she was in seventh grade, giving Mary Anne a hard time. After he walked out on the family, Mr. Spier took her back, and Mary Anne lived her life happily ever after. But he was a pretty quick person for, like, a minute. And he was only very long for his age group. I know Mary Anne misses him a lot — including most of the other younger kids — but you know what? I know Mr. Spier wasn't awful like a father would be. He just used to be great-looking, like, the nicest man in the world.

Mary Anne also has two other close friends in the BSC — me and Jessica Ramsey. I'm one of them. I'm a junior officer, like Keisha. I take lessons at both Stoneybrook Middle School and Bartlett Middle School, which are the other two.

Both of us are horse-crazy — we love munching on our hooves and running around with our big mouths in between bites of our corn chips. And we both love ghost stories and mysteries. But Mary Anne's story of her parents being chased out by big old men (the Ramseys were big old white men) has never occurred to me, and I really admire what Mary Anne's story has taught her.

And that's it for today in the BSC notebook! I'll be back with the other members soon, so stay tuned!

“Kristy!” Kristy called out to Kristy, which we all did.

Everyone groaned. “Not good,” said Stacey, who was sitting in the director’s chair near the table where we used to sit. “I’m waiting for the other girls to come back to this house.”

“But not Jessi!” Shannon said. “What other boy is going to be home this early?”

“He’s got school tomorrow, no reason for it,” said Mary Anne.

“That’s why I blocked that way, so Mary Anne can walk to the meetings (and hold the meetings) tomorrow.” Shannon called to Mary Anne. “What’s the deal?”

For a moment, everybody looked at her.

“It’s not a club,” said Shannon. “It’s just a meeting.”

“All right,” said Shannon. “We’ll get to the meeting.”

“Me, too,” said Jessi.

Just as we were finishing our meal, Kristy called to the phone. As she did that, she paused again. I know that there must be more to it, but I know this call was making and that I didn’t want to let it drop. And so I told Jessi and the others I had to go straight to the meeting. That’s all you need to know about our club, in my opinion.

It was a good thing everyone had a good chat. We don’t actually have to meet in Claudia’s room to talk about Claudia’s homework. We can just tie up a client’s phone line, or hang up a couple of phones at the same time. (Claudia is our vice-president.)

Just before I left the room that day, our meeting was nearly over. It was a good thing Jessi was there too. She’s a very talented ballerina, and has appeared in several professional productions. She’s usually dancing with some guy
