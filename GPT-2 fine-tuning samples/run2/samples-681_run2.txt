 even a total whiz.

The only exception was Kid Rock, who was a member only once. He joined the BSC after he was let go by the Sea City, California, school board, for which he had such a huge following. (I’d just graduated from college when I met his daughter.) Now that he’s gone, Kid Rock has become one of the BSC’s most popular members. I couldn’t have been happier with him. He made the club possible, and I think it’s helped save lives.

Kristy Thomas is the president of the BSC. She is very big for big ideas. One such idea was Kid Rock’s musical fund’s creation. We made the band happen — and it was so great that we were able to arrange for a sitter to take on a solo career.

Kristy was president of the Baby-sitters Club for two reasons. One, because it was her idea, and two, she is the president of the BSC. (If I had to pick just one reason she would describe the BSC, it would be her big mouth.) The first reason is that she is the president. The second reason is that the club was her great idea. Kristy invented the club after her husband, who was divorced, left. Her kids, Adam and Karen, spend a lot of time with them, but they aren’t around too much. Suddenly the kids couldn’t take some of the work. Kristy organized the club, and once the club was organized, we all went from being very few to having plenty of sitters.

Kristy’s greatest gift is that she keeps busy. At all times she has openings to take jobs from people who need sitters. And she puts together great, fun jobs, too. We called her the Idea Machine, but she’s not. She runs the club and is constantly dreaming up new ideas.

I think that’s why we all keep expanding the club. For instance, we now have a club notebook, in which we each have to write up every job we go on. It’s very helpful, I think, because it’s very different from the usual stuff about me and my friends. We don’t know who we’re going to sit for, or what we’re going to do. And when we do, we don’t just read it over and over again. Instead, we’re super-engaged in writing it up, and we’re good readers and keep track of what’s happened in our lives.

Kristy has a brilliant mind for organizing and running the club. But even though we call ourselves the BSC we still meet in our parent’s basement. We call it a club because no one else in our neighborhood really has moms, or boyfriends, or kids. It’s a great club, but we try to provide the best service possible. For instance, we never have any "club" in the way of rules. Instead, we just have one phone number, which we set up for all of our appointments, baby-sitting assignments, and other special events.

As I walked into Claudia’s bedroom last Wednesday, the sound of crunching on my digital music player interrupted me as I ran over to answer the door. Kristy was already moving away from the mansion we always shared, and having trouble closing.

“You can’t come, can you?”

I sighed and opened the door to Claudia’s room, closing the door behind me, and stepping inside opened up the secret hallway.

Kristy’s office is in the vice-president room, since our house is located in Claudia’s family’s sixth-floor bedroom. We use the hallway as our headquarters because at that moment our baby-sitting charges are darting around the room. (Claudia would always join in the fun, if it weren’t for the fact that there would be no way for her mom or me to escape from her clutches.)

The moment I walked into the room, I had a feeling that my friends and I must get bored. We’re looking for a good job, but not here. After all, school is almost over, and only two of us are working full-time: me and Claudia.

“Claudia, can I talk to you?”

“Sure,” I said.

“Well, I don’t mind your opinion. I’m just curious about something you did today.”

Claudia’s eyes lit up. She was talking about a subject that had come up all over the place at the meeting — homework
