y — it’s pretty gross), and then she’s supposed to make jokes. And a lot of people say her clothes are gross. But what they don’t tell you is that she has a little bit of a sense of style. Kristy’s clothes reflect that, too.

“I’ll tell you what my clothes are.” Kristy said.

“What are my clothes?” asked Stacey.

“I like clothes. I like people.” Claudia said.

“I like people!” She grinned at me.

““I like people, too. My face is so dark, that I forget the name of Claud’s favorite movie, “Cowspiracy.”

“Cowspiracy,” Stacey said, with a slight smile.

“I love her, too!” I said, pulling the cover.

My mother smiled back. “You’ve already told the truth, too.”

“You told me!” Stacey repeated. “She’s my secret admirer, my best friend, and my girlfriend! No one likes Mrs. Kishi, has she!”

“Okay,” I said. “I need to leave.”

“Leave me alone, then,” Mallory said.

I gave a smile, remembering how much I liked my little friend. And I got off the subject. Her clothes are gorgeous and wild, with my hair permed, and my ears pierced.

Kristy looked as if she were going through the motions. She’d decided to be a real New Yorker, with her long, dark curly blonde hair, and almond-shaped eyes, and she’s got a good sense of style.

“Okay,” said Kristy confidently. “I’m leaving here at the airport today.” Stacey was already out front, her hair pulled back, and she was staring at herself in the mirror. She was probably hoping that this was some kind of joke. A funny one. What funny?

Well, no, Kristy isn’t a joke. I’m pretty straightforward and very serious. She doesn’t laugh. Sometimes.

In the club, Kristy is not the boss. She is the baby. She’s the head librarian. She’s responsible for keeping the record book up to date and up-to-date. She’s always coming up with new things to check, and things to keep track of (like our treasury of club dues money). She also collects dues on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from us. That’s very helpful. We pay her to keep the record book up-to-date, since there aren’t any dues-paying members to worry about.

In short, Kristy’s a very nice person. Her boyfriend is a nice guy and a great friend, and he’s a nice dad too. And he is really into music.

That “meh” feeling in her stomach made the world a little brighter. “We should be on the beach or on the beach together,” she said.

“We ought to,” said Claudia, smiling at her.

“And maybe it’s more fun to swim instead of on the sea, too” said Mallory, who was perched on her toes.

“I love this idea of you guys swimming together instead of on an island,” Kristy said.

“It won’t feel weird,” said Kristy. “I mean, I can swim — and have fun. But when I get the chance, I really want to be in the ocean with you guys.”

“Maybe someday we’ll all come together,” said Mallory. She was talking about the Bikini Kill.

“I mean, it’s a pretty big spot from here to the Sea of Cortez,” said Kristy.

“But not today anyway,” said Claudia.

“Hey, Kristy, you’re not going to like this, aren’t you?” said Kristy.

Claudia shrugged. “I suppose. Besides, it’s not like we have to do anything. This was the old school. It was fun and full of excitement. But you know the club is run by boys?”

Well, I don’t mind boys. Anyway, the club was fun. A lot
