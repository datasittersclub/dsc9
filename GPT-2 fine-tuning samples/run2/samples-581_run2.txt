 grow and growing.

The girls aren’t exactly new. They’re in Little's arms. They’re in her blood, their hair, their nails, their chocolate-colored clippings of chocolate that tumble down their cheeks. They look like dolls. And they’re talented. Kristy is an outstanding artist, with her own creative flair, but she needs teachers and support in order to get to her other major talent: writing and drawing. (Claudia, on the other hand, just moved here from the United States, and her parents are worried about her reading and writing at school but keeping grades up-to-date.)

There are two other members of the BSC — the sixth-grade math whiz in the sixth—"Sir" Watson," Kristy says. Kristy is the club president, and she is also … a decent president. She has these two great ideas out of thin air. One, she invented the alternate officer system. That’s when three main officers — Charlie Pike (Mary Anne’s boyfriend — and Mal and I — the junior officers — step in when a club member is sick — four times a week — with an occasional pizza party — and then every four weeks for a month — leave the club to take baby-sitting when we have sitting jobs for clients.) Two, Kristy invented Kid-Kits. Those are boxes that parents decorate with their own toys and games so the child can play with whatever they happen to be holding. I was the first to bring them to life when I saw how much they changed the way I play soccer.

The BSC members we know best are Kristy, her brothers and brothers in general. Their personalities are similar — outgoing, friendly, open-minded, and full of ideas. Kristy can be a bit bossy or overly-casual, but the things she tells me are a lot better than what I’ll ever know. For example, for the time being, the club notebook is sort of Kristy’s big mouth, but it will probably never deformed a single other member.

What I really miss about Kristy Kristy is that nothing ever feels completely foreign to her. She really is a character from Home Alone, just like every other person I know. I can relate to her, though. She’s a strong person — someone who can handle it. She can cope with anything — noise, conflict, sadness, pleasure, pain. And if there’s anything she can’t cope with, it’s her sadness. She tends to cry a lot, because she has nothing left in her soul that could pry open a million mysteries.

I love that in California you can get a beautiful soul and then turn it down after you’ve had your fill of miserable people. In fact, California is one of America’s most miserable places. To the rest of the world, California is a dump. It’s a miserable place.

At times I feel as if I am in a sinking ship, which is why I come to many meetings when I’m sad. It frees me from the rest of my family and makes me feel much less at home. Kristy and I, naturally, have been through lots together, although they are not opposites quite the way we are. We are very different — different with our clothes and our hair and our families and our families and our minds and our personalities — and that’s okay.

Some of Kristy’s best ideas for the BSC are: (1) a club with a phone — free — that everyone can use. (2) a record of our jobs — in the club notebook — and a club notebook with notes on every clientele we sit for.

This is a major help, and Kristy is my other best friend. Kristy is the type who likes to be with you alone (except when we need extra help), and we have a lot in common. For example, what we are both passionate about is healthy eating. It is one of our great passions, along with good health food and ecology. In addition to wanting to make our families healthier — and healthier for animals — Kristy wants to make our families healthier for our three brothers (Charlie is the president; Kristy is the secretary), sisters, and babies. In fact, we’ve all had to make major changes to our families at some point in our lives. Here are some of Kristy’s ideas for the club:

(1) the BSC Record-Keeping Club. It’s a big brother and big sister club, with officers, officers — officers who keep up-to-date our clients on the job pages. Each of us is responsible for writing up every job we go on, and then we take the information about who’s available to us and
