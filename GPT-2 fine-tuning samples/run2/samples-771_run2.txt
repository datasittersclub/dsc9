======== SAMPLE 1 ========
i. That's right—we were baby-sitting for two boys we haven’t sat for all season. This year, Jessi and Mallory were on their own. Plus, Logan had been sitting on the floor with one of the charges.

Oh. So we’re only two members short of triple whammy! And boy, did we miss their chance to take charge. I couldn’t wait to explain how we could best the charges, but before I could, the phone started ringing with my announcement:

“Call Kristy for your friend…. We’ll take it. This is Jessi and Mal,” I told the club.

“Great,” the club replied.

It was clear Jessi and Mal were looking forward to catching up late on that rainy Sunday.

My assistant started off the phone, “You called? … Yeah, I know it works. The Arnolds are having a softball game tonight.” I tried to follow their instructions and had to repeat the procedure again. “You go, you go, ” I said. “You call this meeting, you call that, Mary Anne.”

“No problem,” Kristy replied. “Good. This is our baby-sitter job.”

But I had to admit, the meeting was pretty busy. Most of the sitting kids were busy. My new friends Kristy and Mary Anne, Mal and Jessi, joined them, which didn’t bode well.

I wasn’t thrilled about that. Even though the meeting hadn’t started yet (or at least, I didn’t tell everyone), I guess I was pretty mad. So, naturally, I checked out the calendar in my book and decided who should take my job.

Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike took it. They weren’t sure how to dress (mine had a cool black outfit — no fancy jumpers — but boy, was I still jealous) but they figured out that Kristy really wanted to throw some parties for me and would probably take one of the baby-sitting jobs, so Jessi and Mal picked up their jobs.

I headed back upstairs to collect dues toward my phone bill. I hate paying my dues, partly because it gets stashed away sometimes in my room, but partly because I like the meeting, fun, and the club. I don’t think dues are bad because the money helps pay for things like Mal’s phone bill and Charlie Thomas’s digital art supplies. (I like to think of the snacks as learning stuff, which is why things are labeled like easels or things.) So my total treasury is definitely reasonable.

As I mentioned, we also use club dues to pay for things like my phone bill and Kristy’s digital art supplies (although I don’t actually own them, though, which is sort of the funny story). So now the club members have a budget for each of their many duties. That covers (are you ready for this new business?!) expenses such as taking baby-sitting jobs, paying my bills, and keeping track of the club members’ schedules.

Mallory and Jessi are junior officers because they’re eleven and can only sit in the afternoons unless it’s for their own families. They don’t need to go to the doctor for services, though, and they don’t have any special rules. That means that Mal and Jessi aren’t allowed to get haircuts that night, or wear makeup, so Mallory takes our two associate members jobs. (Claud has just joined and I’ll explain why later.)

The two associate members are Shannon Kilbourne and Logan Bruno. (Logan is a friend of Kristy’s who happens to be Mary Anne’s boyfriend.) Shannon lives in Kristy’s neighborhood and goes back to school in her neighborhood’s hair, makeup, and hair braids (ahem, those little thingy accessories that come in pretty handy on rainy days, but they don’t have to be in addition to what you’d wear anymore, right?). Also, unlike Kristy’s hair-raising job with the Papadakises, Logan’s not a club member. Now I had fun.

So that’s a brief history of the club, how it works, and how I got to be the president. At the top of the agenda was getting organized. That includes a calendar with all of my appointments made, lots of personal information about the jobs (such as my allergies and allergies (yes, I have asthma) and how often I’m allergic), and a scheduling diagram that shows which members would like to take the jobs
