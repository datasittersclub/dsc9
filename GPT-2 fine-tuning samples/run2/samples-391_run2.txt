======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 meets and he's perfect because he's so good at this stuff. I don't actually know him well but when I read an author's notebook when I was little I could tell what had passed between the pencil and the paper and make out what was on paper by looking at it.

He was a really good student, really good, but what caught my eye most was the name. I mean, what kind of name were you going to use to describe the man I saw in the notebook? Well, he had some trouble at Stoneybrook High, wasn’t very bright (he’s in high school), and wasn’t in school, but by this time I knew what he looked like and it looked perfect for him. But he’s just a year or two away from full-time living so I decided to ask the guy named Watson how he’d spell his name. That solved it. Anyway, shortly after I told Watson of the problem, Watson met one of his older brothers. The two of them got married and the couple got some pretty rich and glamorous things to do. Watson brought the two of them back to New York, but that was in a year and a half after she moved back here.

The last picture of Kristy was taken in that room.

Then there were the clothes. The picture of Kristy showed her in a turtleneck, jeans, and a huge T-shirt. And her face: a little smile in particular. (I could never wear a T-shirt with a smile on it.)

And the final picture was of her dressed as usual. She’s on her loose, wearing a great little black jacket over a big silk blouse (with red polka dot patches on the collar). And her hair: always the curly one.

Now I’m not sure how she ends up with curly hair and is shy around people (she wears black lace up shoes), but it sure looks cool to have. She wants to be a writer someday, and as an author someday she’s going to be famous all through her life. I feel pretty good about the way she looks.

Maybe I can start out with this passage from an article Kristy wrote:

"The best way to show someone you know that they’re not alone is to let them know that you care. And that you care about them a lot is that at the end, you tie them up, and say, ‘I’m going to let you leave.”"

I don’t know about that. It certainly doesn’t sound good on Kristy. She is shy and, I guess, and her parents are a little overprotective of her. (I wouldn’t be surprised if Kristy started hanging out with boys before she fell in love with Watson.) Kristy loves to read. She also loves horse stories. She’s really into all the mysteries and stuff, but she’d be proud of just about everything if it weren’t for the fact that Watson kept her locked up for life. So what does Kristy think of Watson’s behavior? Kristy isn’t very opinionated (she’s shy and bossy and even complains about boys), but I guess she’d like to put Kristy’s personality at ease because she’s in such a weird place right now.

The closest I could come up with for Kristy is that she has a boyfriend named Richard Taylor. He’s an excellent football player who just loves to football. But Kristy also loves sports and loves her baseball and softball teams. So maybe she’ll join a team someday, too.

Besides, Watson’s so jealous of Kristy’s, and so are I. Maybe someday Kristy will marry someone else, like Kristy’s will.

Kristy is one of those unusual people I never get used to. She doesn’t care much about clothes or style, but she cares a lot about this. She got really, really old when she was in the same family as Kristy’s dad. Then when Dawn left, that was pretty much all she had. Then when her brother Charlie left, that was pretty much all she had.

Maybe she’ll live in a mansion someday, but for now she’ll be living in a room at the top of the mountain. No one knows.

But she’s the only one in the family who isn’t broke or who’s sick. She gets help if she’s in any kind of financial hardship. Like it or not she’s still a single parent. She and Claudia are very lucky because both of them have other parents. Both of the kids don’t eat fast food, but
