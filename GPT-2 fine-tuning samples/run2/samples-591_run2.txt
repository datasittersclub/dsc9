“How many? (Whisper)”

“Three.”

“Is that a million?” (Stop)

“Three?”

All three of us grinned, which made us all laugh.

“Well, I guess one more is really needed. The BSC meeting is coming up. Then come to Stoneybrook. We’ll be meeting in your house again soon.”

We were laughing so hard that we decided to turn the phone off and talk about the phone. I think we were the first friends of Kristy when we got to Stoneybrook. After all, Stoneybrook is where the family always used to live. Kristy’s mom still lives here and her dad still lives. I feel bad for her because she lost her mom here for good. But she’s very adjusted to her new home and she still sees her dad. Mary Anne has a cold and she spends every other weekend in town. She visits a lot, so I guess she’s feeling pretty welcome.

After that phone call, I called my friends at the Baby-sitters Club together again and asked them about a baby-sitting project we were planning. "We have a bunch lined up now, you know," I said. When they said yes, it really was a chance to see who they wanted baby-sitters for the next few weeks. "Just for you — it’s on Monday morning. Three days from Christmas, and chances are, Mary Anne and I haven’t chosen two weeks," I said.

"Cool," said Dawn. She thinks that the idea sounds as if it means a lot. "That could be the best mother-daughter idea," she says. "We could do it together and we all know how it feels to be the only girls in a family when you have ten kids in one house."

"Cool idea, no?" I said. I hadn’t thought of the whole thing in one phone call. That didn’t happen often anyway. We thought we could spread the call evenly among us.

That day, that Friday before we left our jobs, I called all the members out of the house and told them to expect a meeting the next morning. "Mary Anne," I said. "She’s going to be busy too," I promised. I’ll give her your information. Mary Anne is about the same age as me and she likes to be close to her. She’s not a great listener and sometimes her mother doesn’t tell her where to sit when she has to baby-sit. The BSC tries to encourage that by letting Mary Anne take the lead when it comes to baby-sitting.

How do all of these different clubs work together? As Kristy explained it, they’ve been a very good set-up. The idea was that one evening, while we were at our meeting, Dawn and Mary Anne found a group of friends who really liked each other and decided to get to know them better. The girls invited them to sit for our charges. As Kristy pointed out, all of them really liked each other — except for one — and they invited the rest of us to join them. The girls say they’re pretty sophisticated to begin with, but we thought they’d be a tough bunch anyway. We invited them all and it worked out great.

It turns out, a lot of good ideas happen when parents come up with them. My experience with Dawn and Mary Anne helps me see some of them. When Dawn and Mary Anne found out that our first baby-sitter, Dawn, was an animal — and that she was going to be very careful about what she ate and when — it really struck a chord with them. Isn’t it a good thing we always share a room and keep each other up-to-date on what’s happening with the other pairs in our house? Besides, I didn’t find that Mary Anne was becoming more and more like a substitute teacher, since her other duties included looking after Mrs. Spier.<|endoftext|>
By three hundred years of the past century, horses have disappeared from our school uniforms and our scrunchy lunchboxes. Maybe it’s just me! But this is the first time that I’ve had to say that no one has had so much fun at school. Even so, I have something of a reputation for being funny.

That’s what I meant when I said that school was a terrific experience for me. Friends and teachers and my own friends and fellow students all said the same thing — that was just a bunch of fun, awful stuff. That was probably true, though, because there are plenty of other clubs in Stoneybrook who have similar experiences with
