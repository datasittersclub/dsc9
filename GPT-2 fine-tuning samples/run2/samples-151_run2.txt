. But it would sound like the worst idea in the world. To me, it sounds as if it might look like that stupid, awful idea. How stupid? Because if you add my idea to the list, and then I add mine to the world, there's not even a pretense of sophistication. Besides, the idea might even be stupid!

I'm trying to think of the least rude thing in all of art that day.

It wasn't my idea in the first place. In fact, maybe it wasn't even my most embarrassing idea the second time around. That was the idea of Mary Anne Spier.

Mary Anne comes from a rich family. Her stepfather raised her (her brothers only), but she goes very, very — conservatively! And that's not a bad thing. When Mary Anne and her parents moved here from Stamford, their neighbors were so strict that it became a real nightmare for the Spier family — and to me, one of the best things about becoming a great, great stepfather was being around his kind.

So Mary Anne has to live with her mom and dad and her older sister, Janine, and her mother. They live near her neighborhood, but she's not allowed to go to and from her usual visits (other than to Kristy — the only other family I've ever been close with, actually).

Mary Anne has a younger sister, Becca, from the time she left school to be with her father, Philip, when he was divorced. And Mary Anne and her two sisters, Anna and Mallory, are her best friends. They're best friends because they're opposites to the rest of us. Mary Anne and her siblings weren't in the house at first, but they're now.

The idea began to interest me — and not just because I have a passion for horse stories, or because I use to do horse stories at least a million times a month. Mary Anne is one of my best friends, and I think being a good, good friend is one of the best things in the world.

So the idea for Mary Anne started back when I was eleven. When my parents divorced and my brother Charlie got a new home, Mary Anne joined. Since then, our friendship has grown and grown.

The family we share is kind of like the Schuettes: a mix of good-natured, nice (not romantic) parents, and a steady, steady steady, steady, steady, steady, steady, steady, steady, steady. This family is sort of like the BSC, though, except it hasn't stopped working on Mary Anne. We call them the Baby-sitters Unit, and we've worked hard to build a family of our liking — from her new friends to her family to new business, to new talents.

Now, I'm not saying that Mary Anne's going to become my best friend. That would just be wishful thinking. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised to see her in good company in the BSC.

But for now I think Mary Anne is going to be my best friend. And you can make some pretty strong, strong, strong impressions. She may be quiet and caring, shy and shy, and really good at something. Maybe we could become good friends someday someday.

Maybe that's the secret. As Mary Anne says in the club phone call, "Life is not all fun. It is. It is soooooooo fun for all different people, but it is for the best, and you should stick to it because it is."

Well, if Mary Anne is going to be my best friend, she needs all of us — me, my stepsister Dawn (who is one of the club members), Logan, and my brother, Jeff. And she also needs the members of the BSC — Mary Anne, Kristy, Stacey, Jessi, Karen, Stacey, Mary Anne and Emily. That's why we always meet. When we do, we record the jobs. We look forward to seeing what the kids think.

We also try to put together good ideas for the members of our club. For example, in the club notebook, Mary Anne writes every job that comes in, and sometimes she goes all the way with just one notebook. The pages may not be great, but they add up to a really good idea. For example, in our seventh-grade notebook we describe every job that comes in — how we designed our rooms, what our materials are, and so on. Then we mention the information with a creative flair, even if some of the other job descriptions aren't as creative. For example, the notebook might help us decide which book of poems we'd like to write, and we might include a description of our pet hamster and how to bring it into our lives. We might even start a group called the Baby-sitters Club (BSC), where we try to find a good
