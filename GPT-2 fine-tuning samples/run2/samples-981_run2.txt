 has to pay attention and concentrate, she can be a workaholic. She loves to tell the stories and tell funny stories that she thinks children will read, and sometimes her stories get the grades they need to qualify them for kindergarten.

Mallory and Jessi are junior associate members because they don’t have many other responsibilities, such as Jessi’s kennel or paying my brother Charlie to drive me to and from the meetings. Jessi is the only black student in the eighth grade, and she comes from a town mostly of some kind. She has long blonde hair that she wears pulled back, the sleeves of which are pulled back just a little. She wears braces (the clear kind, where the lashes are tied at the base), pencil skirt, and printed skirt. She is the oldest in a family that is growing to ten, and she has always done her share of housework, so she could easily fit in that family well.

The newest member of the BSC is Mallory Pike, her age (she also dreams of being a children’s book author and illustrator someday). Mal is a great writer and illustrator, and she loves color and looks. She has medium-length blonde hair, which she cuts back to make it shorter, and blue eyes, so she looks sort of like a relatable character in a real children’s book.

The BSC’s two associate members are Shannon Kilbourne and Logan Bruno. Logan takes up most of the slack in the club, although Shannon has volunteered her opinion a lot. She’s probably the closest thing we have to a true best friend on the planet, and she’s something of a romantic — a great-aunt, short for Logan, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. She is also extremely shy and sensitive (which makes her our Bat Mitzvah Cleric), and she’s the only one of us to have a steady boyfriend. His name is Henry Lourdes (he’s the one who started the club), and he’s about as laid-back as you can get.

Logan live on the other side of town, homeboy type. He’s a great guy. He has a Southern accent and he’s a good listener. Shannon has a killer smile today and a smile tomorrow, as well. She’s the only one of us who has two younger sisters. They are very close, and the longest-haired of all of us.

Logan is, as I mentioned, Mary Anne’s sort of a “boyfriend” sort of gal, but the good news is that he’s a good friend to be in the BSC as well. There’s nothing like going to a new job, getting a job with a new client, or taking a sitting job you don’t love. It’s a perfect time to be in the club, because I already told you that Mary Anne is about as cool as the next best thing cover. She’s also very sensitive (which makes her sister, Janine, who is a true genius), and a good listener.

Logan and Mary Anne have been friends all their lives (they even look alike — they’re both on the short side), but they were also very different years ago, when they were both twelve and in eighth grade. That was when Pollyanna was spreading around. It wasn’t long before those two girls, Dawn Schafer and Jessica Ramsey, started going to shows and getting shows, and then the rest of us started going away and becoming friends with them. They kept coming back. Soon enough, the Schafers got their money’s worth. And when the parents found out how badly they wanted the money, the girls settled down. Club business continued to boom.

In fact, it was getting better until one day the money went wrong. At the beginning of seventh grade Mary Anne Spier, my best friend (she has two older brothers now), decided she’d need help with the treasurer of the club. Mrs. Schafer had promised to come to Manhattan and collect dues, but she had to quit the job one day. She knew Mary Anne was unhappy with her. She took her pile of money, cleaned it up, and divided it among the two older girls, who were at that time students or students at Stoneybrook Middle School. Why? To see if we’d help her.

Maybe I should have started at the beginning of that thread, telling you about everybody who is an associate member. That’s how we get in. One of the girls is Shannon Kilbourne, who goes to Stoneybrook private school Stoneybrook (where she’s in the club). The other is her best friend, Mary Anne. They are sisters, and they have a lot in common
