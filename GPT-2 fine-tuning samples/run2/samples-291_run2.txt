’t too scared of me, but she’s allergic to things that’re plastic, dust, and potting mix, she’s Japanese-American, and I’m pretty sure she’s allergic to everything. She’s just as gross about her clothes as mine, but, let’s face it, her parents don’t approve. And Mr. Spier is a real jerk. I think one of the things he’ll do when he gets older is start making his own decisions based on what he thinks will look most appealing to girls.

Jessi and I were sitting in a small, dark room with our mothers. Then we overheard the phone ringing right in the middle of those little meetings. "It’s Monday, Mom!" I called back to tell Dad all about the appointment. He’s the president of the Baby-sitters Club and the vice-president, too. In fact, Mom and I have been best friends since we were baby-sitting. But we both feel the Bernese mountain dog, which is the coolest thing on earth, is more of a dog than we think. We’re both very sensitive, so the dogs aren’t as gross as Mom’s, but we share many of the same feelings as well as talents.

Speaking of talents, Mom and I got along okay when we first met, then we were so close. Both of us are eleven (the eighth-grade teacher, not only had to be ready for the job) and we are all thirteen. But not only does our parents have rules for the big dogs in the house, they have rules for all members of the “big house” in town, too. Some of us live with the Bernese mountain dog, while I live with the other two siblings. Our parents work overtime to support me, so we are pretty far along as far as parenting goes.

I was born and raised in Stoneybrook, so it’s not as if I’m different to anyone else here in Stoneybrook. I’m quiet, though, but I feel as if I’ve been treated fairly, not just because of the Bernese one (though I’m not just talking about Stacey, either. I’m talking to several boys now), but because of them.

My parents have been very nice to me. They used to be pretty strict with me when I started high school. They gave me nice clothes, and stuff, and allowance for everything, but now I’m as if they don’t give a rat’s ass about anything. Plus, they really respect me. I’ve been treated very much better in their homes since then than I’m even aware of. (That’s because they’ve all started dating, but they’re much, much older.)

Mary Anne started as a single parent and then became very good at school. Now she’s with this big local club called the “Boy Scouts of America. They don’t have any rules, but they can say that a kid who isn’t allowed to read or watch his own mother can still be adopted. (Well, that’s a tough one, since you have to be extremely careful when you choose the kids.) After I got to know Mary Anne well, I realized she’d made a really great impression on me, one of our original members.<|endoftext|>
After a lot of debate, I decided it was time to tell you about Mary Anne. As you can see, I’m the shortest person in my class. I’ve been wearing jeans, a T-shirt, and sneakers for the last year and a half. I’m the longest student in our class, and I'm the only one with our own personal style.

I was the very first one to leap to the conclusion I’d already told you about. That was in seventh grade, when my mom was finally allowed to raise four kids by herself. That wasn’t something she wanted to wait through all the way to seventh grade. I was sure she’d be thrilled about being allowed to raise four kids by herself, if she had known it. But she didn’t. She’d decided, instead, that Mom was making her best friend spend most of her time with another man. This was true.<|endoftext|>
When I went on a search for the nearest movie, Mom was the one who came up with it.<|endoftext|>
“I had thought it would be a great idea to do something like that with my first four kids.<|endoftext|>
“I know it takes some getting used to,” I said to
