======== SAMPLE 1 ========
. Our current headquarters is on the other end of our sixth-floor hallway, where we keep our club record book. Our secretary, Mary Anne, has the neatest job, keeping all our important information up-to-date. She always knows what's going on with our clients — the kids they've baby-sat for, for instance. And she's totally involved in our scheduling.

Our club treasurer is Stacey, our alternate officer. She needs the job because she and the club's other associate member, Abby, need the job because they're both major lanny in our grade. They each contribute half of the dues and cover our occasional expenses, such as Claudia's phone bill. Stacey's been helping put on the BSC record book for the last year, while I'm responsible for keeping track of my own money.

Abby's not in kindergarten, of course, but she's the oldest in our family. She's got a little brother (she's eight), and a sister named Emily who's absolutely musty. Her dad raised her by himself until she was six. When Ethan was in sixth grade, the Thomases moved across town to get them all across again.

Not long ago, Abby's grandmother moved in with the family, too. That's because Emily Brewer is African-American. Because of that, most of the people in the family are from the neighborhood, but Nannie (Abby's mom) moved in when her oldest brother, David Michael, was born. The Brewers adopted her two kids, Andrew and Karen, from Vietnam. (They live at the house now.) There are also Emily Brown and Nannie (David Michael's grandmother) and all of them. Nannie's aunt Cecelia lives with them and helps take care of them.

That's about it. Plenty of work. In fact, I'm afraid I'll never retire as BSC president without Abby and Mary Anne getting to work together again. We're so glad to be part of a much-loved family.

"It's five-twenty," said Abby.

Jessi cleared her throat. "I hereby call this meeting to order."

"Meeting to order," Jessi said in an overzealous whisper. And just as the clock turned to five-thirty.

It was dues day. Not long after the meeting started, the phone started ringing with calls from all over the country demanding they pay dues in full. A week or so later, the club was back in business. Our regular customers would need a super-early, super-stamp-perfect meeting to pour out their money!

Jessi had given Mary Anne plenty of advertising opportunities just to be able to call the meeting to order. Then she was told to call Mallory and promised to send her some of the money if it paid bills. Just as she was calling, another sales call came in.

Mallory was excited, but she didn't want to upset anybody by giving a sales call that day. She just wanted to tell Stacey she could take the job.

Mallory made one more desperate shriek, but it was all right before she could answer another. Mallory was really mad. She called the meeting to order, but she never made any further sales calls. When she did, Stacey called back to say everyone had to tune in!

Stacey handed over the club record book to me. "See you soon," she said.

It was Dawn who took charge. On the back of the book, she records every single baby-sitting job in it — the sitting jobs that get done, the denials, the complaints, the entries. She also keeps track of our earnings, so she knows how much our dues go toward special stuff like replacing our club members, paying Claudia for her phone bill, and so forth.

When Dawn left, we replaced her with Mallory. Then Jessi took over Dawn's job, and then there was Stacey, too. They were new baby-sitters, but they were in a new neighborhood. Jessi, who was now Dawn's stepsister, grew up there, and her grandmother, Nannie, moved in after her. (I have a theory about why that happened, but the truth is not as interesting.)

Stacey is so smart — she knows how to combine learned and new ideas into one great, practical joke. She's also addicted to junk food, which she believes could cure her of her severe addiction. She also claims that watching her parents cajole her into eating things that might be harmful has cured her of the infamous "nausea" she has been having.

"Hmmm, isn't that fascinating," Kristy said with a wry smile.

"My parents need me right now," Abby said, putting down the magazine.

"Oh, but of course they would," Stacey
