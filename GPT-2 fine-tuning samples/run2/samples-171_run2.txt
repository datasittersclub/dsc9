 wearing her up. I know I don’t, but I just can't stand that smell.

It was one of those bad, embarrassing days I remember. I wasn’t in the mood to read a romantic comic, since my father told me he thought I looked like that as a kid. And he probably made fun of me until I found out he hated my Dad. I said, sorry but no thanks and got up and went to the TV to check TV.

My dad had already called one more time and made one more call. So I made a reservation about leaving a message at the door, and then I told him no. Then he said maybe if he found out, he could make our baby-sitting business work. He made sure we didn.

I couldn’t imagine what that would have tasted like. My dad was already dying to have more free time when this happened.

(If you were trying to convince me to sign up, I didn’t say no, but instead, I just said no.)

And that was all I could do to keep my friends informed of the Baby-sitters Club. I was so glad I joined in.

After that, I went back to the room that I always stay in. A few minutes later we heard a knock at the door. “Hello, Mrs. Mancini?”

“I’ve got a call from Mrs. Mancini,” I said.

“Hey, it’s me,” replied her.

“Mrs. Mancini?”

“Yes, Mrs. Mancini. Mrs. Mancini just left. I’m here to catch a cab to my old neighborhood.”

“Uh-huh,” I said.

Mrs. Mancini is a real, live person, so we are all pretty busy. It was not hard.

One day, I was driving back from the Baby-sitters Club meeting, when the door opened and Mrs. Mancini greeted me, she paused in the middle of the street and looked at us. “Welcome, Mrs. Mancini. This is Mrs. Beaudry, my neighbor.” (Mrs. Beaudry’s real name is Claudia, and she and I are neighbors, so we all have our own address in the city.)

“She was right at the door,” said Claud, looking at me. “You mean we were coming for a ride?”

“That’s better. We’re in Stoneybrook, too.” Mary Anne grinned. “Yeah.” She turned and looked at me. She looked at Mary Anne with a look of envy. “That was an easy ride, is what she said. Well.”

We laughed and talked again. It worked out. We ended the conversation in a few minutes. I knew what I was getting myself in for.

“I’m going here to catch a cab back to Stoneybrook,” said Mrs. Beaudry, as though she had just finished the Baby-sitting Club meeting.

“I have to go now,” said Mrs. Beaudringer.

I smiled. “Mrs. Beaudry had said her old neighborhood was on a tight-rope. She thought it was really a place where we could get a ride on one of our old horse-drawn sleighs.”

“The old horse-drawn sleigh,” said Mrs. Beaud. “There is plenty,” I replied. “But there’s a lot new.”

“New developments,” said Mrs. Beaudringer. “But I really don’t want to go with the old sleigh. I think it’s like a real horse-drawn sleigh.”

“Well, a real sleigh,” I replied, ” and I had the pleasure of being able to ride it. Then, after I came back to Stoneybrook, I went on a horseback. Then, I was back with a horse.” (Mary Anne still loves horses.)

Claud and I looked at each other and laughed. But Mrs. Beaud had forgotten my memory. She couldn’t remember anything about her old sleigh, or about what it was used for, or what I’d gone back to, or why I had gone with the old horse. It just hung in there and didn’t tell me anything about the place.

“So I’ll be back now,” said
