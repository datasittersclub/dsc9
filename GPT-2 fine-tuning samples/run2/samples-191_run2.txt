======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Of the people I know are my family), her dad (who was divorced), her older brothers, and her sister (Gina, Abby, and Stacey). Abby's a talented pianist, which is why she plays on violin at the same rates as her younger brother and sister.

Stacey has blonde hair and brown eyes, like Abby, and a healthy amount of healthiness about her. She has diabetes and the hormone insulin (an important hormone in the body that helps regulate our blood sugar levels). Her body tells Stacey to get rid of refined sugar, but Stacey still insists that she stays away from refined sugar. That's because Stacey is crazy about math, since she has great science skills.

"Okay, I should write in the newspaper," Abby said as she stretched out her arm. "But that's not at all what I was thinking about tonight."

Before we even finished writing up Abby's story, Stacey picked it up from my desk and read it in her full, deep, unbroken, voice:

"Hey, Mr. Barrett. I'll call up some business. Can you help me set up some business at school tomorrow?"

"Yea, sir. Mr. Barrett is right behind. I could do it myself. He doesn't make our job difficult.<|endoftext|>
The bus was still going at full speed when I made a decision which afternoon I planned to give up my gym membership.

The rest of us did. Luckily, the business had grown quite well in the last year. Since then I have decided to spend less time on the weekends and less time on my jobs. This gives me the time to rest, relax, and rest during the weekend. I also decided that the less time people spend in the gym, the better, because my brain and my blood sugar control are compromised when I do that.

Now that my club has grown and grown, it seems that Stacey is looking forward to earning that money again if she gets a chance. She and her friends are usually great bettors for a club I'm going to join. Stacey is a little girl. She and her mom moved here from New York City about twenty-two years ago. Their mansion, along with their two dogs, are all gone, so I get to hang out with them as often as I can. But I have to admit, the house they used to live in was a kind of secret passage that nobody could see. I should tell you what it was like to live on it. And that's exactly what Stacey had to do. If she didn't have a secret passage, then she never would have a place to go. The secret passage is the most secret place in Manhattan.

That's why I want to share it with you now. I think everybody should find out about it, especially Stacey. She moved here knowing well that Stoneybrook — and Stacey — would be a much cleaner place without it.

What I really mean is that Stacey has moved here knowing well that she and her brothers and sisters will live here, too — at least for a time. Stacey and her two kids adopted Emily Michelle, one of our pets — Misty, who loves to read, and Watson, who is a real life baby. After she's gone, the McGills will probably be living in Claudia's old farmhouse, where she grew up — and where she grew up.

Stacey and her kids, Jeff and Emily Michelle, will probably live in a mansion near Claudia as well, which is a lot of house. (Jeff is a very, very large-minded person. He wants to be a musician and a writer. So is a very small-minded guy.) That house is now in the hands of the Ramsey family — including Karen, who and Derek, Claudia's oldest brother, are also in the family. They love them. And they also share some interesting pastimes, such as making a pizza party for their little brother.

There are two other things about the house that I love even more than Stacey and Emily Michelle. The second is the smell of perfume. Claudia just loves it when you smell a perfume in the mouth and you sense there's something about it that makes her fonder. It might be what makes the house smell like a desert, or a jungle.

I mean, smell is kind of disgusting. It's disgusting because it hides the disgusting things about us. For example, the house is full of dead animals on the steps, and people who live there, in all kinds of crazy outfits. There's a giant pile of goldfish, a pile of silverfish, and the smell of rotten meat, dust, and other stuff hidden between the holes in the wall. I like the smell, but I've tried not to let it deter me. Besides, don't tell Claudia and I that she'd really want to be in the house.
