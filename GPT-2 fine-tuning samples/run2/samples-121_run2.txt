: that was the worst joke anyone could make. I always find it strange that nobody was ever embarrassed about being on another planet.

The reason we both thought it was funny was that our parents had married the guy who was their neighbor, Watson and Claudia Kishi. Watson was so impressed that he invited me to live with them (which is exactly what he thinks we should do). Claud is a real professional musician. She's also an artist. She loves painting and she's a big fan of all things blues. Claud's been a student of art since she was four.

Claud and I both know the difference between real life and this alternate reality (the real life one where you can actually look like a human being). We both understand that in order to survive during those times, you have to be very, very special. We all have our favorites and we all have our favorites. Claud knows that, and she knows that her parents have made special promises. But as long as we come to these alternate-reality events, I don't think she wants to think about anything else. We live in a world with rules and rules aren't necessarily easy, and people have to adjust to their new lives.

At some point, though, some of us are a little too sensitive to rules. We all do what we want to, but things are better now if we realize what we're really good at. Claud says, "When people say, 'I just want to be a good parent,' they mean, 'I have to do something really good and make my parents happy. That's how I work. And I just want to be a good parent even if my parents don't like it.' That's true for anyone. But that doesn't mean I can't do it. Sometimes I think being good parents means being a strong parent and being a good member of the family. I guess I should say — being pretty special.

Claud and I both feel guilty about not making their parents happy. Both are great kids, but not as good as we think. They both like to be good parents but don't really care what other people think or believe. Their opinions are their own. If someone is wrong about one thing or one thing is right, other people are right about another. But if it's wrong about two things, they are wrong about three things.

I'd like to think a strict family makes one very unhappy parent, not only if you decide to stay single or you're not allowed to see another, but if the parents (who aren't even on the same page) have to make choices that may be painful (like leaving your parents if you are a baby of five). I guess I'd have to live without them, too.

Claudia is a little shorter than I am. She's about eight and wears jeans and running clothes. She's also a little taller and shorter than Kristy or Janine. In the same way that Jessi and Mallory are shorter than me, Claud is as thin as Kristy is taller. In fact, Jessi is the shortest person in the world — she's like Kristy's twin: tall and short.

Jessi is pretty much the only BSC member who is Jewish. She's Japanese-American and the vice-president of the Jewish club because our meetings are mostly held at her house.

Jessi's parents don't approve of her being Jewish. They don't think she's a good kid because she's in eighth grade and their kids have strict rules about her.

If someone had said, 'I have to be very, very special — that I can do whatever I want to do' — the reaction would have been no, it wouldn't have been, 'You know, it's not like that. I can be as good as you and Mom can be, plus Mom and I know how hard your kids aren't going to work.' That would have prompted their cries and groans.

However, just when Jessi's parents realized that her younger brother, David Michael, was Jewish, they realized that being a good parent didn't always mean being perfect. They decided to reach out to the New York Jewish community.

But first they had to decide on David Michael. That was when it came to tying her family together. They wanted to tie everyone together to have a Jewish family. (They even made a collage of David Michael pages with her picture on it, with his name on it and his age symbols on them, in case you forgot.) The idea started to turn into the dream.

The New York Jewish community had known about it and thought about tying them together for a while. Jessi, for one, was the shortest person that they'd ever seen. For them, she was the perfect baby-sitter. As soon as her parents announced themselves, the Baby-sitters Club started gathering around their kitchen table. They said hey, it's okay, it
