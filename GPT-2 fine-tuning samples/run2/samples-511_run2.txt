The SMS club, in turn, was not shy about the fact that Kristy's new parents used to charge so much for our things! For instance, we pay Kristy's brother, Charlie (an associate member), to drive her and Abby to meetings (and she's the only one in our club who really enjoys driving herself to meetings), since her parents think she's immature (to the point), and we pay Dawn's brother, Thom, to drive her to and from her jobs. At SMS, we also use dues money to cover Claud's phone bill (we use both dues and contributions to buy Kid-Kit items, like coloring books, and to buy supplies for our special events). And now Kristy's got an art project in progress.

Kristy is our alternate officer. That means she substitutes if a member is seriously ill, for whatever reason. In the club, she was a big inspiration. She’s one of the best people I know. And she’s always coming up with great ideas to improve our children’s lives.

You know how some people are always complaining about the bus and the commotion in the kitchen? Well, Kristy handles it better than most people. She keeps all her problems to herself and doesn’t care much how she looks. She dresses in jeans, a turtleneck shirt, and sneakers — not school shorts or running shoes. For a long time, Kristy lived alone. Her dad was home (well, he was away), so after her sixth grade years, she and I moved into her old farmhouse on Bradford Court. And no one can compare to her.

Kristy is not the sort of person who’s scared to death. She’s shy, too. And she’s stubborn. But she’s also a good leader.

Kristy’s stepfather, Watson Brewer, is a millionaire. That’s right. Well, he was a millionaire back then too. Then his company transferred him to its Connecticut office, which means he has a mansion in Stoneybrook. (And it’s a mansion, not a hamptons.) And Mr. Spier was transferred back to Stoneybrook. Kristy also moved into an old farmhouse built in 1795. (Yes, I’ve heard that word hamptons — it’s used several different things in English and Middle English at school. Like old horses.)

When Watson moved back to England, he thought getting married could be the start of marrying Watson’s daughter, Karen. Well, that was only an option. But when Watson finally did get married, he and Kristy’s mom became super-close parents. And Kristy is a strong (in a nice way) woman!

So, that’s where Claudia comes in. She’s my favorite Claudia model. I like her dark brown hair, pale skin, and brown eyes. She’s smart as hell, and she does the little things — like take care of a toddler. She’s totally sophisticated. If she was going to have a baby, she’d make one of the baby costumes, like with outfits for the Halloween festivities. So it shows. Then keep in mind the clothes she wears.

For one thing, Claudia looks great in her original clothes. Her hair is usually balmy and permed, and her nail polish and pencils remind me of Janine Le Creuset (of Pringles). Claud can wear most anything and keep it perfect. She can dress just about anything — as a dancer, a ballet dancer, a rock star, a director of children’s books, even an editor of feature stories.

Claudia’s skin is pigmented clear and clear and almost black, and her hair is always shiny and shiny and curly. Her figure is light and graceful. She’s the shortest girl in the eighth grade, and she’s tall (she’s got brown hair and brown eyes) with blue eyes, like me. And her clothes are pretty. She doesn’t go out, like I do, but she does dress up in styles she doesn’t mind. Here’s another thing: Claud has thick, long legs and wears glasses and braces. Maybe someday she’ll get contacts and she wears glasses and braces. Claud also likes to wear her nose (the’s where the blood comes out) and her ears (the one against her ears) instead of her nose, because her tongue is just a little bit full.

So Claudia is an artist (actually I guess that’s a great word!) and I can’t wait until the holidays come around. But I know that if Claudia stays away from her “new world order” — which is probably the wrong one — she could become
