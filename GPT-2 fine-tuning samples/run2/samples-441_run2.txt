======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 they would only spend a few weeks each way in Stoneybrook.

I decided to try going back to their house (with my friends) and finding out if that was possible.

The phone rang again. But this time, with some more interest. Dad was on the phone, calling from Hawaii. Well, Mr. DeWitt was right behind him.

Mrs. DeWitt was getting ready to leave.

“Come down, you guys,” Dad would have to say.

Mrs. DeWitt made her way toward us, and we all scrambled to reach her.

“How are you going?” Dad was calling again.

I felt bad. The doors were slamming, but I had to push them open to safety.

Mrs. DeWitt was pushing them down the hall, as if they were steps, like a horse.

“Hi, my name's Carolyn Swanson, and this is Mrs. DeWitt.”

“Well, that’s good.”

 “Is that good, Carolyn?”

“Yes.”

That was fine.

Claudia was rushing in. “Are you all right?” she asked curiously. “Yes. I’m fine now.”

Claudia is just the oldest kid in her family, and her mom is an absolute librarian. What could you do for her if you could read her mind like a book? I couldn’t wait to see what they were talking about.

The room exploded with noises like “Ah, that’s the book,” and “That’s fine.”

“That’s not fine. It’s that book! What a nice little book!” Claudia shrieked, holding it in one hand.

I could still feel the excitement in my chest, because I was not quite sure what to do. Maybe I should wait until next Tuesday for our big Achie weekend.

I started to feel worse. I tried to hold on.

The next thing I knew, Kristy was running up the stairs with her umbrella, her pencil, her pad, and her club bag.

By that time, we were in the lobby. Everyone had closed the door behind us.

Kristy was running over and behind us to pick up her umbrella. I had to help her get it to the sidewalk.

“Baby-sitters Club!” I yelled.

Kristy was already on the verge of tears, but now she’s much more organized. She’s such a good baby-sitter and a great person!

Kristy’s the president of the Baby-sitters Club, and she runs the meeting in her big, neat big blue suit. (She’s always the undisputed queen of organized group meetings.)

You know how Kristy was having trouble coming up with a title that best describes her? She would answer, “Well,” and then go on to explain about how the club was her idea. That “is just.” or “You see … I mean, the rules are in place. We don’t have to tell anybody anything.” She would then suggest something new, such as “I might put a lot of people together to try something new.” She’d even say something interesting like, “I’ll name the people we can baby-sit for, and they’ll come up with their own names for us.”<|endoftext|>
Kristy Thomas is my other best friend at Stoneybrook Middle School. We are both very close, but when we first meet it was hard to be a first-grader. I figured we’d be running late for the Christmas fair, not least because we were the only ones with our own “little” group of friends, the BSC. We meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty to six in Claudia Kishi’s room and we do it with such ease. (We talk in the hallway, at first only in sentences, but that’s because we have to memorize things now and then and don’t complain.) Anyway, not long ago, my aunt came up with the idea that having a “little” group of friends — in particular, one who can be organized and helpful — would be great, so I joined those smaller ones. Kristy and I went to our math class together and we talked about Claudia and Mary Anne, and then there were the girls at the Pikes Middle School. After that, they’re
