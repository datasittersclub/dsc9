“It wasn’t my fault,” she said, “that we went straight to the hospital.”

“I’d just been thinking that’s all they needed to know about me,” I answered. “I’ve been thinking about your sister. She’s dying. That’s all she needs to know about me, to know what's going on with my brother and sister in the next few hours. Is that enough to get me off scot-free?”

“No,” I admitted. “They’ve been teasing me.”

“They’ve been?” Stacey cried. She was wearing pink makeup, which made her skin paler and her eyes like barrettes. She was holding a bag of popcorn with one hand and a plastic spatula with the other.

“It’s not wrong,” I said. “But I didn’t know she was dying. My mind was already on the popcorn and the spatula.”

“The popcorn?” Stacey repeated. “Yeah. I got it from the fridge. It said there’s a new kid in town, and there’s a new girl in town who looks sort of like me.”

“You should've seen her,” Kristy added.

Kristy is the president of the Baby-sitters Club. In fact, she was at the Baby-sitters Club meeting that day. She said the club meets in her room three times a week, one after school. She hung up the phone, picked up the phone, and dialed five-thirty-nine. She told everyone to call five-thirty. Then she said, with a mix of hope and sadness, “I know I should have called that number sooner. I’ve got to know the parents. How long have some people known about their kids?”

People who know about their kids well are often amazed by Kristy’s answer, since she always keeps telling the truth. She knows all the rules, but the members know nothing of the adults’ rules. Some of us, like Vanessa, are surprised by some of Kristy’s suggestions, since we have become friends more often than she would like.

Kristy is also a strict member. That’s because she hates anything that might get in the way of the club or its members. Kristy would always come up with some good ideas (such as replacing the club record book with one she keeps, since the other club officers know less about kids), but most of her very worst ideas are just for giggles.

The Baby-sitters Club also has two junior members — Jessi Ramsey and Margo Asenett. Mal and Jessi are in sixth grade at Stoneybrook Day, like the rest of us, but Mal and Mal are just as responsible as Kristy. Mal is very involved with school sports, especially track and volleyball. She drives us to and from meetings, and she loves to be the center of attention.

Like Kristy, Jessi’s family has been in my family for a long time. She and her younger brother (David Michael) moved here from high school, when their parents got divorced. Their father stayed in Manhattan, where his company transferred him (which had been Stoneybrook Hospital). The Ramseys had grown up in Connecticut, a pretty different town from Jessi’s hometown.

Their mom met David Michael at a football game, and had them sign up for the Ramseys’ Krushers. They also got to know each other pretty well, since they both played softball (Jessi had been our all-star center), and also because they share a love of horses.

That’s the main difference between the Ramseys and Kristy’s family. Kristy is white, while Mal’s (that’s why their family’s name is so weird) is black. (Mal’s family is different because her family was originally from Africa.)

So that’s the BSC. Our members are all terrific. We also have four associate members who are friends, Mary Anne Spier, who is Mary Anne’s boyfriend, and a group of friends we call the Baby-sitters Club, which is supposed to be a business, but who were also temporarily let go by the members’ unexpected (unable to attend meetings) and, of course, Mal, who is a genius (she’s the subject of one of Watson’s letters), and Stacey McGill, our treasurer. They’re Stacey’s boyfriend and girlfriend, and they just
