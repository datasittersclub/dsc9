 with the fact that I've barely finished supper.) Jessi wasn't thrilled about my absence. I'd done something I felt was "intrusive" and had made a mistake in trying to do it.

Our meeting was still going on and we weren’t exactly munching on pretzels or watching TV, but I thought I could see if anyone noticed. I looked around the room and saw a bunch of guys in black jumpers. They looked pretty cool. We all said they’d all be around to the BSC meeting, or else we’d get stared at. I couldn’t decide if it was because they weren’t wearing their jumpers or because of the way the sun had moved, but all I could remember was that Sunny’s hair was starting to glow in the green of her jumpers.

We were all staring at my desk at that particular meeting that afternoon, and everyone was giggling. Kristy was holding up a digital calendar with entries from the past five years. Mallory leaned toward me.

“Five Years Later,” she reported, leaning back. “Sunny, Tigger, and Mary Anne,” she said. “Now, I could watch the Olympics.”

Jessi took a bite of pretzel croutons. “Let me tell you about the Olympics,” she said, making a mental note of the name and repeating it one after another. “Don’t you remember the first time they played ball?”

Mary Anne swallowed hard, and I knew it wasn’t a funny joke. Mary Anne has a funny habit of repeating things. She’s very good at it, in case you were wondering. For example, she said that they played baseball some years ago, and I guess a bunch of other times now. And that they were very organized in the sports that make a baby's life easier. I don’t know whether they knew that for sure, but in that moment just a couple of kids looked at Mary Anne and said, “Well, I guess they’d better play ball, but” (Mary Anne paused, and I knew she meant.)

Sunny, Tigger, and Mary Anne, I was in the meeting at that particular time for the first time since Dawn’s divorce, and everyone was talking and saying their favorite TV show was The Big Bang Theory. “The Big Bang Theory,” said one, and everyone looked at me and said it was the best work of all time.

“How did you feel when you first saw the Big Bang Theory in public?” asked Sharon, who was sitting next to me.

I couldn’t say I’d experienced it very well. Maybe my brain had been swimming in the essence of the show, I guess. Maybe it really was the essence of the show, even if I didn’t like the title.<|endoftext|>
As I came home from school the next morning, I found the front door open. Dawn and I were gone. Stacey was now leaning across the street from me, holding me, and we were both sprawled on the front lawn, feet dangling from the leaves.

I took a deep breath and listened to Karen, Abby, Mary Anne, and Simon (whose house had changed) push the front door open, and Karen shrieked out, “Karen!”

“What’s so funny?” asked Jessi.

I gulped and sat down next to the other girls in the eighth grade. Shannon and Boo followed Sharon and Kristy to the bus stop. Maggie and Logan, Stacey, Laine, Kristy, and Mary Anne, and Jessi and Mallory followed me, too.

I found a bag of pretzels at the BSC meeting and took some. I don’t know if I could sit for the kids more. Even with two bags of stuff (not that I’d be able to do much), I would probably faint just thinking about the pretzels.

Logan and Shannon were still walking up the stairs. I could barely wait to find out their names and phone numbers.

“Come on, Logan!” called a voice, carrying a woman sitting at the head of the stairs. “This is Mrs. Logan,” said her. “Do you wish you could go to the baby-sitting club tomorrow?”

It was a familiar voice, with her long blonde hair pulled up in a sort of Hawaiian hairstyle. She looked a little embarrassed to make herself look good, but she didn’t say otherwise.

This was Mrs. Logan, this nice old lady who lives on Bradford Court, with eight or
