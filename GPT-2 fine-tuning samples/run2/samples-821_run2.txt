 they.

We are almost over the line. My mother has bought me two things from the supermarket: a pretzel tzatziki bag and a Ring-Ding T-shirt. I have two holes pierced in it, and the front covers are covered with T-shirts. I hate to break it to my face, but Mom won’t budge. If I had one of those things, I’d have to ask her to turn it upside-down.

I looked up until the bottom was covered with the Ring-Ding T-shirt and thought, Why couldn’t my mother have that? I mean, she can’t wear anything besides pretzels and twinkies all the time. She also can't eat junk food and, well, I don’t know if she could make that stuff up. She certainly wouldn’t let me eat Ring-Dings or Twinkies, either.

Stacey is the treasurer of the BSC, just like everyone else. She’s in charge of keeping track of the money we earn; keeping track of our dues money; keeping track of how much it costs; and scheduling our dances. Stacey is a real math whiz, so she does a lot of her work, and she is awesome at it. Every week she collects dues to help pay Charlie Stoneybrook Elementary (now N.Y.C.) coach shoes and uniforms for our junior Bat Mitzvahs. If there’s any money left over, we chip in for fun stuff like a pizza party.

Stacey is not the only BSC member from New York. She’s the other, very latest, addition to the BSC. I think it makes her the most fashionable member when she comes to New York. The Big Apple is pretty far away, by New York standards. Stacey and I are both wild about the city, but we don’t live there because our parents were never here. Somehow Stacey managed to make the trip without coming back to land.

We’d been looking forward to boarding with her hadpper for quite some time now. I told you I was happy to see you, but there were those times when I felt as if I was walking down Fifth Avenue. I wondered if you’d seen me.

“Hey, Stacey!” you said.

And you were right. I was wrong.

We took the bus back to the station. Pretty soon after that we started to feel completely empty.

“Ow! Oh, don’t bother!” we shouted.

“Please don’t go!” asked Stacey.

“No! No! Don’t—”

I glanced at my two friends.

“That was Dawn Schafer. She lives across the street.”

My friends giggled.

“Dawn!” asked Stacey, tugging on our shirts, which we had covered with a cloth.

“Oh, no!” asked Stacey.

“Hey, that was Stacey …”

“Really?”

I tried hard not to smile. I have a feeling that a little might not leak out if Stace were to get caught in a few seconds. I know I wouldn’t want to be stuck in a few, even if it meant being mugged.

“Oh!” repeated Stacey.

She closed our doors. Her clothes are really stylish, as are our hats. And, well, we were out in the cold, so I suppose we could walk around in our old stomp jackets.

“We were just about six o’clock when we got caught up on our BSC meetings.”

“Kristy,” I said, “we might as well get moving!”

“Jessi and Mal,” said Stacey. “Can we start tomorrow?”

“Great, it’s five-thirty,” I said when the clock said ten.

“Want to know something …” she asked.

I tried to compose myself. I packed a couple of lunches and a half. Then I started on the BSC meeting. “This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club will come to order!”

I did.

This is how the BSC works. Clients, sitters, parents, whoever is closest, phone our number, and we take calls on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from five-thirty to six o’clock. Most of the time, we are busy with the club, but on Monday we were
