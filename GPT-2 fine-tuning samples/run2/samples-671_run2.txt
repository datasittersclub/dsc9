======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 one of Stacey’s best friends. She’s also very organized and loves to be in control of her schedule. That’s because she keeps track of every single thing she takes with herself: how she eats (which of course is no small achievement), the average amount of sleep she gets, and more. Mary Anne’s mind is astringent and she is sensitive when she sees tiny bubbles of it in the air. It takes practice to make us all feel comfortable in our cribs, even though all we really worry about is our gross, out-of-control imagination.

Mary Anne’s most remarkable quality is her patience. We call her on extra work that day to set up sitting jobs.

She’s stubborn, but she’s a good leader. And she does it well.

Her other quality in the job is her will to do right things. Mary Anne is the logical leader of the group. No other mental or physical quality is met with more emasculation from Kristy.

But I can tell that Mary Anne loves this job very much. And Mary Anne is a pretty tough cookie to love. Mary Anne’s personality is just the opposite of that of Kristy’s; she is very direct and she lets you know exactly what she really thinks. That may sound trite, but it definitely helps to calm nerves.

Okay. Mary Anne is the BSC's secretary, and I should know. In case you don’t, I should probably explain how the club works. It was Mrs. Thomas, a Stoneybrook native, who brought us together. When Kristy was in sixth grade, her mom died. Mary Anne and I had to cope with grief, and we’ve always known that Mary Anne is a sensitive and thoughtful person. She’s convinced that people are afraid of ghosts. Mary Anne’s grandmother Mimi lived in on all the little houses and was very important to the house. (Well, at least she lived until her very last breath, when Mary Anne went to bed.)

Anyway, Mary Anne is great at thinking big. And it shows. Mary Anne is a health-conscious person who takes good care of herself. She usually looks in the sanitary napkin of her desk (the notebook, for one). She thought up the BSC one night when her mom was in California. She saw how filling everyone could be and immediately created a BSC notebook. Kristy and I were pleased with the idea, but Mary Anne was crazy about it. She couldn’t sit right and it just seemed like the worst idea ever. She’d like to write a book about it, but she couldn’t find one yet.

So she sketched Mary Anne in sketchbook form and sent it to her. The person who sketches is the best! That’s how Mary Anne became her …

Mary Anne is very shy and quiet. When I arrived I felt shy and lonely. But once I got to know Mary Anne, I realized that I needed to look up “neat shyness” in order to find out more about her.

“She’s getting extra shy these days,” Mary Anne said. “I guess she needs to be less brash these days. I mean, she used to show me how to carry herself.”

“She’s getting more and more uptight,” Mary Anne added. Mary Anne is not typical of Mary Anne. She’s happiest when she’s treated like a true, authentic, born-to-Be-She. Mary Anne is a tomboy who loves sports. And she’s got this incredible Southern accent, so her family naturally came to her.

“Hi,” Mary Anne greeted Mary Michelle as she entered the room. “Is Mary Anne home now?”

Mary Anne was immediately blushing. “I’m glad to work at M&M’s.”

“Great!” Kristy barged in. “You look great in the Baby-sitters Club.” She smiled.

Mary Anne rolled her eyes and pushed them away. She sat down at the table with Kristy. “Mary Anne, how is everything?” Mary Anne offered with a giggle.

Mary Anne looked great. She’s tall with long blonde hair and the slightest bit of freckle on her beautiful black blouse. Her ears were pierced and shiny, and the pinkish-green blouse was decorated with a yellow ribbon around it.

“Hi, Mary Anne!” called a group of noisy baby-sitters. Mary Anne reached for me and pulled me aside. “Are you all right, Mary Anne?�
