 closest of seven (and five) times each week. In this way she was always prepared for any baby-sitting jobs that came her way.

It's been a good thing that Kristy, as the club president, is an excellent president since she invented the organization and has been totally fair to the members who elected her. This is not the case with all the members of the Baby-sitters Club. One of the big problems was that Kristy had to make a dramatic adjustment. At the beginning of seventh grade she moved to Stoneybrook at first (her family moved back), though her parents still live there. Her mom (who was divorced) made one final adjustment because her old house had to be completely gutted. It was all replaced with a much better one. It's a total mess, and Kristy has had to cope with it. She keeps a healthy weight on her back (she has chocolate allergies) and is very health conscious.

Kristy's health problems stemmed from the fact that she has asthma and has to be extra careful about what she puts into her inhaler. Kristy also has asthma attacks. She could be totally ill if she didn't take good care of herself all the time. (Don't laugh, though — she can be quite bossy.) There are also a few bad habits that can creep into her bloodstream easily. One of them is sports. Kristy knows it and she's said she should have played in the Olympics. Another is junk food. Kristy still stashes candy and cookies all over her room (even though the supermarkets are hardly full).

The BSC was Kristy's life (and mine) for a long time. She became an ordinary, happy person after her dad left the family when her younger brother, David Michael, was about eight. She met them instantly and blossomed, too. Her mom is a big tomboy, Kristy's favorite dresser. Her stepsister, Mary Anne used to be an associate member, but she's no longer with the club, and the McGills are happily divorced.

Kristy is the shortest BSC member, and she is also also the oldest of eight kids. She'd probably fit neatly into any other club family, but she's been living with her dad than with her two brothers (Sam and Charlie) over the years. Kristy's brother, David Michael, is nearly seven and Kristy's sister, Carolyn, is the same age. Kristy's parents are practically a stepfamily now, thanks to the adoption of Watson Brewer, Mary Anne's stepsister. Then there's Abby, who came to live with them from Long Island, after the divorce. She's the newest member, and she's pretty short. She's originally from Long Island and has brown hair and brown eyes.

Our vice-president is Claudia Kishi. I'm vice-president because the BSC met our family here. It wasn't always that way. Claudia's room is crowded and she has plenty of art supplies. Her bedroom is more like a work of art than a creative room. There are also her paintings and drawings to prove it. Claudia's family lives in an alternate past in which she can't attend these meetings. (She is an actual genius, as you'd expect her to be, but her parents say she's too young.)

As I listened to the others talk about Claudia, making notes, I felt like I was writing letters to a friend:

What did you have between those letters and the letter, really? A notebook? I wondered.

This was the kind of question that would make anyone think twice about writing a letter. I mean, I would need a whole week to write it. But, really, that is what I wrote it to do. The answer lies in Claudia's very own eyes. She saw her mom's (well, my mom, by the way) dad's death before nearly a year. After that, her parents were totally broke. They couldn't even grieve over their daughter's death. (I can't.) And, unfortunately, they couldn't seem to bring themselves to help Claudia.

Then came the tough part: the hard part. First things first, Claudia was trying hard to look as stunning and chic as I could. I mean, it's hard, at times, to be dressed like an American Girl, even if you're from this land of cool. But then everything about me clicked. I started turning black and beautiful — and exotic — clothes made my skin crawl. I fell in love with Stacey. I fell in love with Vanessa. I fell in love with Anna. And I fell in love Shelley. Stacey and Anna are best friends and love horses (Stacey's a collie), especially horses that are part of my family. Besides being gorgeous, they both have serious health problems, and they keep me warm during the coldest months.

Then came the hard part. My parents got divorced
