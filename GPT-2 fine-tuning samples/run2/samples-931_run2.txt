======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Barbara, and she just started reading Nancy Drew books, and she’s repeating that every week because that means she won’t like to be reading anything that has a lot of reading, like Nancy Drew. (Like, for instance, the books on which she’s been trained, like that Mary Anne already told you about.) It also explains why Kristy and Dawn and even though I don’t want to be eighth-graders, and especially because neither of us likes school, neither does Mary Anne.

At any rate, Kristy, ever the strict student, did go to Stoneybrook Middle School, one of the strictest schools in Stoneybrook. It was like a concentration camp, in which the smart ones failed miserably and the rest of us went to sleep. But it was better than those other schools, and right from the start we got to know and like the rest of the kids. Oh, well, even though the school year is over, the Ramseys still live in an old, old family. In fact, they recently lived in a real, live mansion for quite a while.

Kristy, believe it or not, is still an ordinary person. She lives with her parents, her stepdad, her adopted sister, Dawn, and their dog, a Bernese mountain dog, and her Aunt Cecelia.

Anyway, it’s pretty amazing that Kristy and I would meet each other face to face and have thick, curly, sweaty arms. But we do get romantic. The rest of us laugh. And at times, like when we were baby-sitting for the We ♥ Kids Club, it really affected us. We often felt as if the whole thing had been won or lost.

Kristy became a grandmother just because Aunt Cecelia gave birth to this little girl. She also became very homesick, since she missed her long-ago stepmother, although she’d known her all her life, even when she was still living with her father.

Anyway, soon after Christmas, Dawn moved to town, leaving Kristy’s family in the dust. But they went to the trouble of convincing Mrs. Schafer that there was still a place for them in the BSC. They recruited Stacey, Mary Anne, and their ten-year-old friend Mary Anne to help with the case. And just as the case was turning ugly, Dawn began coming to meetings. (They hadn’t been letting her down, though. She’d been too busy to spare much time. Plus, her grades had been bad enough, and so had her job. But nobody seemed to care.) The BSC had begun a new life with Dawn, all the members of which had to be done in a matter of minutes.

When Stacey left, we replaced her with Jessica Ramsey and Shannon Kilbourne. Shannon was a neighbor of Kristy’s, but she took a little while to adjust to her new life. Then, when Kristy was pretty sure Jessi and Mary Anne were friends, Jessi took two jobs and added Jessica to the mix. (When that happened, no one was quite ready to part with Shannon's life. That’s when Shannon gave Kristy one of her two openings: no good or not, two good ones or one bad one.) Fortunately, that wasn’t the only bad one so long as Shannon gave Kristy one of her two openings.

That was it. As the phone rang again, and the conversation went on for as long, Mal came in with three openings. “Baby-sitters Club,” she said. “Yes, I’m here. Yes, I’m here. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You’re free. Now. What is wrong with you? You haven’t been taking this for a while. I could never understand what you’re going through.”

“Nothing,” replied Mal. She was in a rush. There was something very wrong with her. For one thing, Mal had heard that the idea of Jessi and Mallory taking jobs together was a flake. For another, Jessi’s mother was making a list of things she couldn’t stand. They were going away for several months. So Mal had no choice but to have her feeling all maddening.

“Mal, I really miss you and miss your friends. I know you do not feel better.”

“I miss learning about other people, too.” She was smiling so hard she almost looked as if she had just been struck by lightning. “But I also miss the warm weather. I’m so glad you’re okay. Of course I was glad Mallory is back.”

“Thank you,” said
