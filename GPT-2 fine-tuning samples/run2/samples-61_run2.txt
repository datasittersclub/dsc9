======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 so much stuff, and I can take them out the way I like them. If they're too heavy, I'll throw them out the way I like them. Like I said, if they look like an old man — like a pile of junk, with an old clock on it, and the number bar in the bottom right of the description — I'm going to throw a book bag overboard.

Dawn: And you think that's a good reason?

I: You'd be shocked. I mean, we had dinner at the kitchen last night, and we were all sat up, which, I admit, makes me sound like a maniac. But then I realized I made more than I was letting on, so I said what I said, and I was like, "Don't worry, everyone is going to be okay. I'm really looking forward to it."

Well, at least there's no more of that.

When I came back from my meal, I found Nancy Watson and Shannon Kilbourne sitting right next to me, talking about the game, and we talked like crazy about it. And it was great, because everyone else was laughing along (but not because I had a lot of fun playing it, anyway). The room was dark, but the sound of laughter was really going off. We were all so organized, and even though we're not allowed to sit to other people's dances, I felt like dancing.

I was laughing so hard (and fast) that I almost felt my right leg slip off the floor. Luckily, I was able to pull my leg out again and was feeling like a little girl right out of Anna Karenina.

I went upstairs to my bedroom, where we each sat, my bedroom door open. My clothes were still in my jeans, as were my shoes, which, I think, were too low. I checked my bag for more stuff, and I started to sit down.

"What are you doing in the KITCHEN?” Shannon asked as she held up her jacket. "I don’t watch the Kinkos."

"Oh, I’m having a baby," I said as I sat on my patio. "I have to go to sleep."

"Yay!" Shannon said with a wisp of her hand.

"Just going to bed, no need to tell Dad.”

We sat down again, this time at Dawn’s. I think we just finished watching the Kinkos. It was a good show, and I'm super excited about all the books and bookshelves and new toys I have to give away.

I put my notebook back in the car, and I opened the front door, which was locked again as I went inside the Kinko-Club, just as Shannon and I were getting ready for our meal.

I opened the door again, and as we ran inside with our books and other stuff, Shannon was giving us our directions. We were so sure. She told us to call our mom, who was sitting there with her baby in her lap. Shannon could tell she was just getting ready for our kids.

Just then Shannon opened the door, and we went inside, too. It was just us, a baby, and our best friend, Shannon.

After a moment of quietness, Shannon pulled her hand across her mouth.

"Good, Mr. Watson," she said, as she led us downstairs.

"What did you do?" I asked her.

"You're the president of the Kinko Club," said Shannon. "That’s why you're here. We don’t have to do much at restaurants or stores. We just sit around waiting for the kids to come home."

"What? You just said you’re the president of the Kinko-Club.”

"I’m not the business," I said.

"And you're not an official member," said the other member. "The club is private. It’s called the BSC. Only one person has the right to join the club (everyone else is allowed to be in the Kinko-Club). You may be able to take me to meetings, I’m sure."

“Be assured," said Shannon. “Good, good to have a BSC member here, isn’t that great? “I’m glad we can do it.”

“I can start right away, aren’t you, Mr. Watson?" I asked as I walked away.

"I would think so, too," sighed Shannon. "I think we can easily expand. There are four kinds of BSC members. That’s you, Shannon, Logan Bruno, Jessi Ramsey and Shannon Kilbourne, and you,
