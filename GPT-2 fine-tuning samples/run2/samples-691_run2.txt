. She was a member of the Baby-sitters Club in New York.

As secretary, Mary Anne has held that title for as long as I can remember. It's partly because of her big mouth and partly because she's so involved in all sorts of special situations. She's the only one of us BSC matters (other than emergency meetings, which are also handled by her), and she's perfect for it. She's very organized — she has a love-hate relationship with busy parents, can't find a sitter who can’t pitch in to help, and is bossy at all times.

Mary Anne has brown hair and eyes and is a member of the BSC after us, too. She has two younger sisters and stepsiblings from her mom, who died several years ago, and then-boy, do we ever get romantic. It wasn't easy for Mary Anne, especially the way she handled raising four kids alone.

Mary Anne, by the way, is the BSC's secretary, which means she's in charge of the club record book. The record book is where we keep all our information — our schedules, our conflicts (doctor and orthodontist appointments, after-school activities, family trips, and so on). It's also where we write in the club notebook. We also use the notebook to keep up with our clients — just like we do with any other job we take on. We have two associate members and one honorary member. I hate to tell you who our fellow BSC members are — Logan (whom we named honorary member — you know, because you know who you are), Mary Anne (whose last name is Bart), and Shannon Kilbourne, an associate member of the BSC.

To start keeping up with BSC activity, I put up a red tape — but kind of tinkered. I asked Shannon, Logan, and newcomer Logan, if they wanted to become associates and I asked if Dawn, who'd just moved here from Long Island, could join, too. Now that is a BSC family.

And you should see how filling out our club application — and paying attention to it — you should see that Mary Anne is running around like a pro. (She takes lessons in California, goes to the gym a lot, and does tons of stretching and running.) As I was mentioning, BSC has also been a perfect fit for me and my family. I was right about the mansion.

I can hardly keep up with my BSC activities, even though there are activities for all my friends and neighbors to take place. Actually, Mary Anne and I have been on a family fun run together. After all, her family is huge. She could never dream of owning two huge houses!

Mary Anne and her big brothers Charlie and Sam (and brother, David Michael, and their mom) moved into Stoneybrook from their mom's former homestead in Greenville, Miss. Then, when David Michael and Sam turned thirteen, Mrs. Spier got a big promotion at her job. She moved the Spiers around a lot, and I think that has helped the Spier kids adjust to life in the big house. They also have a kitten named Tigger (his real name is Sunshine), four kids (David Michael and Jessica), and a little stepsister who is … Dawn Schafer.

Another big help is Mallory, our newest friend. She is a BSC member, although she recently moved back to the Stoneybrook suburb of Woodbridge, where she just turned fifteen. She spent much of last year in California with her three brothers, who live there for their entire lives. It was a tough time for Dawn because she lost her stepsister, brother, and other close friend.

Mallory just became an honorary member of the BSC. It is the only time ever that we have a BSC member, if she can fit inside, besides Logan, who can't go to school (he's otherwise committed to health and well-being, of course). She is the only member with the organizational skillset to know exactly who is at a BSC meeting and when. (I can't — I'm a terrible speller!) Mal has thick, curly blonde hair, glasses, and braces (not the flashy Claud.) She has a soft southern accent and she's the first BSC member to have a steady boyfriend. She also has a special talent for embroidering and is really good at it. She sees the colors, add colors to her outfits, apply colors to her hair. Mal's mom is a real live genius who invented the wheel and everybody else tries to work it off. She lives with two children of Watson and Lucy (Mary Anne's dad) and their two older brothers, Sam and Charlie.

Mallory and Jessi, who are in sixth grade at SMS, became best friends after they heard about each other. (Jessi and Mal have even shared a
