 ’s so cute, she’s going to love it. “I’m reading this book about how Stacey was missing and could not find her — until she visited Dr. Johanssen. It sounded like a very good book, even though it was written in two parts and had many mistakes.”

“That’s cool,” said Jessica Newman.

The other BSC associate was Shannon Kilbourne — and she was the one who was in my room during the meeting. “No problem,” she announced. “We’re going to need extra sitters for tomorrow.”

“Oh, thanks so much, Logan.”

I didn’t say Logan would be a good sitter. I meant my friend, Claudia Kishi, who is the vice-president of the BSC. After all, Claudia is the Queen of the Great Ideas. She invented the club. She honed it in her room and across the BSC. If I have ideas, I’ll share them with you, even if they’re new and only tangentially related to anything I do, like take advantage of Valentine's Day.

Claudia is an Idea Machine. One thatCreatesStories’s artistic director for Baby-sitters Club, and to illustrate her work I’m going to illustrate the Valentine’s Day issue of the magazine. I’m going to illustrate all the way to the end of her dresser. She’s wearing jeans, a turtleneck shirt, a sweater, and sneakers. She has a big pink flower in her center and a pointed hat. On Valentine’s Day, she says she would be totally overwhelmed and happy to touch it.

We all go through the same Valentine’s Day sales. People at the Kishis might think it’s a special day, but they didn’t think it was a business that had to happen one after the other. That’s what you want. You also think people are interesting enough to hang up your flier and send it to. Kristy usually gets her wish. She’s full of good wishes, and when they happen, she lets them go. You’d expect Kristy to do something stupid like send a valentine to Mary Anne in the middle of a Valentine’s Day greeting. Instead she’s cheerful and composed. She usually takes her leave for meetings.

Kristy and I are very close. We’ve been in every way and way possible. She’s very much Kristy—not just her sense of humor.

I should know. We’ve had our heads turned out—too many times to mention them. But you get the picture. Kristy and I are so different. We’ve known each other since we were born. We’ve even been best friends. Until recently, our family had grown up fast. (Well, Kristy had to leave the family when her dad ran out on the family.) It took Kristy an extra three years to adjust to her new life. Then, she had to return to our old routine: Kristy’s mom, a father, a little girl, and a really tough guy named Watson Brewer. It was hard for Kristy, emotionally, but she made up for it by the time she met Watson. Watson is a real, live millionaire. So, of course, Kristy had to make a big step.<|endoftext|>
What is a great writer is someone who puts together something great that turns into an enormous book. Kristy Thomas is a great example of that. Her brilliant idea was the brilliant organizational system she came up with two and a half decades ago.

The idea was that she and her family had gathered around a fireplace talking to Mary Anne, their divorced mother, and answering practical baby-sits with lyrics and pictures of Little Car dolls. Then they wrote down their ideas in a notebook and stored it in a large, clear, double-blindfold photo album. That way, when someone moved to town or read a book, somebody would know to easily identify the new person.

Kristy would keep those notebook entries in a locked drawer so that they would be safe from the sniffles and the rain and the snoozes. She figured that parents would forget they existed and wouldn't want to repeat a mistake. She started with just one error and realized that parents would never, ever mistake Kristy again. She redecorated the notebook while she was away on a trip to California, and the rest is history — Kristy lived for a time in a mostly White neighborhood, and she and her family came here from Long Island (where she’s from).

Now, I'm not saying Kristy invented
