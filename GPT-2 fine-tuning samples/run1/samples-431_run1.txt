 though that’s not the only thing about us. We’re both short, too (we’re both eleven and in the eighth grade), and we both have brown hair and brown eyes. But we’re different. So is Kristy, who stands her ground.<|endoftext|>
You never want to see a train wreck coming. We all like to jump up and down.

The train arrived, faster than it could coast. The windows lit up. The lights were out. The lights were out. The windows in my bedroom were set. The lights were out.

The cabin looked cool. An old farmhouse with a huge porch. The cabin looked cool. An old farmhouse with a huge porch. A porch? That's how the BSC was built. The engine room was a barn. A barn. A lot of that steel and concrete was steel and concrete. The cabin is pretty much the original work of Reinhart and Winston, the first president of the Baby-sitters Club. But it wasn’t finished until they finished building the barn. When they finished building the barn, they put a barn and house on Long Island.

“This house is going to be huge —” Kristy bellowed.

“It’s definitely going to —” Mary Anne spoke up. “I’m so sorry I can’t hear you.”

“Why don’t you tell me before we take off down the stairs?” I asked her.

“We can’t talk, Kristy,” Mary Anne replied. “Can we? You could take off from your own house.”

Mary Anne pulled up the stairs and we climbed them. She knocked and took off her earrings.

“Are you okay?” she asked.

“Well, I would better be,” I replied. “I’m sorry it’s late. It’s just that I don’t have my watch.”

Mary Anne climbed the stairs. “We’ll see your house soon, Claudia.”

Claudia looked as if she might fall.

Mary Anne climbed the stairs up the ladder. “You know, the stairs. It’s almost a secret passage. I’m sorry, too. A train will never cross it.”

“Well,” I said. “We can ride it. See you then, Mary Anne.”

Claudia reached down and picked up the radio she owned.

“Good afternoon,” she said. “That’s Stacey, the secretary of the Baby-sitters Club. I’ll call her by her last Monday.”

Mary Anne sounded as nervous as I had expected her to be about the radio. I knew Claudia’s nervousness stemmed from her job. Her job is secretary.

Claudia was very nervous about her job. She’s already been through a lot. She wants to begin a baby-sitting organization and she’s scared to death.

Maybe Claudia could get on Claudia’s case.

“I know you know this,” Claudia told Mary Anne. “We’ll call you back within five minutes.”

Claudia hung back. “I need a sitter for Thursday.”

Mary Anne didn’t pick up the phone as soon as Mary Anne checked the schedule. She read Mary Anne’s details, she checked the calendar, and then added the time period to the list of available sitters.

Kristy looked out her window at half-past five. “We were looking for a sitter for Kristy,” she said.

“Kristy’s in the movie,” Kristy volunteered.

Mary Anne sat on Claudia’s bed and leaned forward in her chair. She opened her window to look through her diary. It was clear. The BSC was looking for a sitter for Kristy, the associate member club, and Mary Anne. (Mary Anne’s boyfriend, Logan, was watching helplessly. Kristy wants Logan.)

Mary Anne also wrote a letter to Kristy that night to ask if Mary Anne could have the job. I don’t know how long the letter would last.

You see, Mary Anne’s other brother, David Michael, has two older sisters. And David Michael’s mom has been married three times to this woman named Rosharon ever since she moved away. See, just like David Michael’s father. And then there�
