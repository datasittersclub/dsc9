======== SAMPLE 1 ========
acey has had a hard time adjusting to her new family. Her grandmother, Nannie, moved in just in time (which also happened to have happened not too long ago?). Mr. Spier, who loves his job in California, had been generous with his chips. He decided to buy the house for himself in part because he thought he could find a bigger family for himself, too.

It was a good business because so many of the available pets wanted to please Mr. Spier, including our puppy Tigger. Besides, he likes us, and I know he’ll call us when she’s free.

The last two members of the BSC, Kristy Thomas and Mallory Pike, were the original two members, but they were allowed to take seats for other reasons. They both have so much sitting talent because of the club and its tradition.

That afternoon, Stacey came down from the attic with a big gash on her left knee. She didn’t start sneezing and she didn’t faint. Not even her dentist appointment had been hard on her. Her orthodontist said it was just a pimple. She just has to start from there.

Jessi and Mal are junior members because they’re eleven years old and in sixth grade (they’re not allowed to sit at night, except for their own families). They’re in sixth because their parents don’t allow them to baby-sit at night, except for their own families.

They’ve been meeting in this neat little knot of eight-year-old girls’s shoes, which are white, with little red thumbs and no braces or glasses. The knot dates back to Adam, our little triplet, so it is fitting that it began when Jessi and Mal first began living here. Jessi was the first of us to have her own bedroom, since her mother was very strict with her, and her father never did anything to try to keep the peace. (No, Jessi could not mow down the lawn, she could paint it, and she would fix the brushstrokes, and that kind of thing! Mr. Spier likes Jessi’s ideas, and we adore her.)

Jessi, our other junior officer, has never had a steady boyfriend yet. Her parents call at any moment to call a substitute, and she has to make sure she takes care of the situation before anyone else does. (Her older sister, Becca, is a full-time junk-food addict.)

So the BSC’s three junior members are our associate members. They aren’t allowed to’become regular clients, but they’re on call whenever we are swamped with baby-sitting work.

As I mentioned before, Dawn Schafer joined the BSC not long ago and is an associate member. We call her Miss Southerner. She was going to be sitting for the Thomases, not the Six, but she’d be glad to have her picture on the club record book, so Dawn’s club job would be to be in the club record book.

Dawn has just begun reading the club notebook, which is like a diary. The diary is sort of like our notebook, except the notebook is also divided into short chapters called BSC meetings. The BSC meetings are for half an hour, around noon and five-thirty. We do our meeting in the meetinghouse on Bradford Court, and most of the time we do both jobs. Jessi and Mal always sit in their own separate place. Neither of them has to worry about sitting jobs. Jessi has an occasional duty, while Mal has an extra. She has been reading all about the Devil Child she thinks is an eighth-grader ever since her mother died at the hands of her younger brother, David Michael.

Okay, back to the day we had on so many hats.

We were already planning to bring in the other hats — hats that we made together from leftover tights, tights that we’d dyed, and hats that we’d bought from stores all over town. We had ideas about which ones to bring, but nobody had any good ideas. We always hoped we’d get them all, and in doing so, we were able to earn some money.

As I walked home, I felt a kind of numbness show in my shoulder. I glanced up. Nothing like spending that money on a hat to give yourself. I checked the house a second time, and again the feeling seemed to linger.

“Boy, is something going to be great’d you think at first.” I glanced up again. My arms were going numb from not only the cold, but from the heat. I looked up again, and another feeling rose over me. Why wasn’
