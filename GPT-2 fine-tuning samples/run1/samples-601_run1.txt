 has a record book, where you keep track of our addresses, and it includes all kinds of schedules. You may be able to tell us about special events — our upcoming shows, our baby-sitting jobs, and so on. That's why we call our meeting times during our meetings special.

The BSC also has a treasury. At this meeting, Claudia asked us if we had enough money to buy some new Kid-Kits. The girls said yes, but we were a little overwhelmed. We asked our treasurer, one of Kristy’s old pals, to help us bag napkins and markers and things. She said she didn’t know how we pay our dues, and she didn’t want to make any promises we wouldn’t make. But if we managed to make them, then she said, we might like to meet again someday.

Anyway, Claudia got the treasury note and the We Want Kids’s flyer in the record book, with a picture of the bank in the middle of them all. When the girls read the letters we’d gotten from our baby-sitting clients, they asked if we’d consider opening up offices in their houses. Kristy didn’t have a problem. We already knew that we’d love them. We even decorated our own.

But the treasury note didn’t make us feel good. To Claudia, it didn’t add up. We didn’t want to keep collecting, and we’d hoped she’d think twice before giving up her baton for us.

Anyway, Claudia said she’d consider keeping the money in the BSC wallet, so we began recording every job we went on. That month, we collected dues from our associates and from ourselves each Monday. We also set aside money for club expenses, such as Claudia’s phone bill and Kristy’s brother Charlie’s food costs. And we paid part of Claudia’s phone bill with the dues. (Claudia usually pays our bills in full in about five minutes by answering the phone.)

After our meetings have ended, the meeting clock changes hands so that each member takes a sitting job with us at five-thirty.

Mary Anne Spier is our club secretary. She has a neat, rounded, blonde, beautiful face. She’s also short (although I think she’ll be shorter in ten years) with brown hair and eyes. Although (as I mentioned before) she doesn’t look very presidential, Mary Anne is extremely presidential. If you asked her about sneakers, or whether the ozone layer is made of ozone, you’d get her down.

Anyway, Mary Anne is a math genius. That, I think, explains why she’s on the faculty of the Stoneybrook Day School, the world’s biggest private school, where she is responsible for all our day-to-day business. She has to be cool and studsome, though. I would bet her brain would come out blank at this precise moment when the phone calls (or missed calls) between parents stop.

That is why she’s treasurer. She collects dues from us every Monday, and from time to time supplies us with dues-paying materials, like Nancy Drew books and stickers. That’s another reason she’s our club treasurer: I love math. I learn that way from numbers. And math is the backbone of the club, and math matters so much that most of us don’t really mind paying dues. (We do like to give it away.)

The last important piece of advice that I receive from the club members is this, from one of our associates: advice to the sixth-graders sometimes I get the impression that I always have the prettiest handwriting on a napkin. That’s not true. Kristy Thomas is tall, and sharp and funny and smart. She has a lot of talent, but in a big team she can get sloppy. She’s the opposite of a coach. I think she has a mind of her own and will tell you how she did it. The other club member who really knows Kristy’s mind is Stacey McGill, another tall blonde who lives across the street from Kristy. Stacey is the treasurer of the BSC. If there’s enough money, she could cover the occasional pizza party or clothing day for us. We pay dues so Stacey can cover the occasional weekend stay, but nothing without our help.

Stacey’s good in math, and she takes pride in it. She is super organized. She has a neat needlepoint record book, complete with homework assignment sheets and whatever else is left over. Stacey often comes up with some terrific numbers; otherwise she just writes in a blank notebook.
