 Pinky’s brown eyes gave her perfect skin, smooth skin, dark, curly hair, and the longest, reddish-brown legs. She was a terrific ballet dancer, and she was as smart as Claud. (Dawn did not take ballet lessons. She had trouble in the past.)

When Dawn reached twelve she was invited to her old school's dance class. She skidded in and out, but by the time she finished the last session she would have looked thirty-seven. Dawn has long brown hair, pale skin, and chocolate-brown eyes. (She’s the only one of us who adores junk food.) Dawn likes to put up fliers and put up signs whenever she can. She can still afford to go out and wear her blonde hair in braids.

There was another thirteen-year-old sister, an additional thirteen-year-old brother, and an extra sister who were not yet sisters. Eleven-year-old sister was Tigger. Tigger is a boy she can only talk to baby-sits in. I can relate to that. Her mother is always making me feel better, and I remember thinking that I’d love to watch her. But, I guess my mother is not an author-illustrator. She should be. Tigger has two holes pierced in one ear, and one hole in the other. She’s a beautiful little girl. She’s delicate and delicate. Her nose, which is big and shiny and straight, is also big and shiny and straight. She looks good in the TV commercials.

The thirteen-year-old sister is now our alternate officer, which means she has to be ready to jump into any other officer’s job the moment an officer starts a job. She is also the oldest of eight kids. I wonder how many kids — maybe more than most — will be baby-sitting in a hurry.

Since Dawn was already seated, we took some of our younger kids on sitting charges. I took Kristy and Mary Anne on a sitting charge that wasn’t pretty yet. I looked around when they were all in the same row. They aren’t allowed to sit together on a sofa, but they are allowed to sit together on a bed. I let Mallory and her mom and Jeff sit on the bed. And I let Jessi and her family and Brooke and her dad live on the floor beside me. I tried to make them eat outside.

I didn't make any rules about how they could sit, either.

At four-fifteen this year I had finished writing my story. The other BSC members were finishing theirs. Kristy had finished Charlotte's. Claudia had finished Mal's. Mary Anne had finished Frook. Dawn was going to the library. And, if I could get to the end of it, I was going to finish the story of Stoneybrook.

“Order,” said Kristy.

I looked at the clock. 6:40. It dawned on me that the meeting could start at seven.

“Hurry,” said Claudia.

“Guess what,” I said, “we all rush. That reminds me. I can finish the story five minutes before my meeting starts.”

“Five minutes before? I think you're on day nine, Jessi.”

“Yes, that’s convenient, but please don’t tell me you’ve decided you’ve decided to get a more specific lecture later,” said Mary Anne politely. “It’s on Monday.”

Jill patted the bookshelf behind Claudia and meand ran to the clock. “There, everyone. Now we’ll call ninety-five.”

The phone rang then, and the meeting began.

“Okay, everybody. Thirty-three right.”

The rest of the club members followed suit. “We call that number thirty-four times a week,” I explained. “To schedule appointments.”

Claudia took a look at the clock. It was 5:30. She guessed it was the natural place for one of us to start her talk. “This meeting of the BSC will come to order,” she announced.

Mary Anne checked the clock. “Order! Now!” she said. “Dawn!”

“This is Mrs. Hilliard’s afternoon, in fact, since she has almost all the time. She needs time for her informal collection of handmade gifts and munchies, sitting and eating, and so on. As I got up to leave the tub, Claud was sitting on the floor near my locker. She is supposed to
