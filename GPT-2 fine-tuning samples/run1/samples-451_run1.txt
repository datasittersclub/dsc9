======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 married, and the family has two older brothers, Sam (29), and David Michael (27). The family has two little brothers, David Michael (25) and Jeff (20). David Michael has curly reddish-brown hair (he’s seven), and he’s an athlete. He coaches his brother’s softball team. Jeff is an associate member (like me, I’m a baseball fanatic) and we use the Krushers (who play before dinner every week) for sitting expenses, so we don’t have much money sitting time with the Krushers.

Our vice-president is Claudia, our secretary. She answers phone calls and answers any other official business. She does a tremendous job with such a neat, laid-back style that she sometimes feels more comfortable than I do. She is not only extremely stylish, but also energetic, cheerful, and full of energy. The best way to describe Claudia is how much she makes her a great mom. It’s due partly to her family's excellent health care and her commitment to being involved in her own body. Claudia has a little trouble with diabetes. It’s a disease which prevents her body from managing sugar properly. Claudia has a good sense of humor and a love for healthy food. Her diet is like a sponge, not a stick. However, her skin has gotten used to mild heat and her blood sugar level is down to healthy normal.

Today she was wearing this cute, purple thong over a bright yellow T-shirt. The shirt had red printed on the front and gray printed on the back. The shirt was for her special day this year. I picked out my usual outfit and brought it to Claudia’s attention. She handed it back.

Before I went out on the beach the next day, the phone was ringing and I was so busy that I didn’t see many of the other members. I guess that’s a sign that I wasn’t really ready for something.

“Dinner tomorrow? We can have cheese and tomatoes and tomatoes and roasted nuts?” said a voice in the kitchen. It was an older couple who is visiting from California. (The kids are thirteen.)

“No, lunch tomorrow?” I said.

Mary Anne nodded. “Oh. Mary Anne —”

“I need a cucumber salad for me.”

“No, you can eat a plum salad.”

“It’s great. I don’t know what it is, but I’ll give that —”

“And pickle salad.”

“Noodles.”

I picked my throat.

Mary Anne had opened her mouth to reveal a handful of tomatoes.

“Can you believe this?” I asked. I glanced around the table, but none of her eyes snapped back to me. Mary Anne was looking through my old work schedule and was smiling at me with a smile of her own.

“That’s all —”

“But wait,” I interrupted Mary Anne (who was still staring sharply at us). “You guys are the greatest. Everyone else is terrible.”

“But what I mean is that it’s great to have you around to help out people and it’s great to have us.”

“It is. I understand that. In fact, I admire it. You know, you bring a lot of people together. It works for everybody. It makes life easier for those responsible for handling those kids.”

“The club is wonderful. But if you put me on the phone now,” Mary Anne said teasingly, “everyone would understand better. So that’s why we’re on our own now. You’re all the reason I ran for the hills.”

“Why is she running?” I asked Mary Anne as I passed the napkins to Kristy and the six of us. (Kristy and I are friends — we even go to our local mall twice a week.)

“Well, I like to run, Kristy,” said Mary Anne without any further explanation.

Kristy is my best friend, but she is also my best friend in all this, although I’m not sure yet what that means. Maybe it means that she is not as shy as Mary Anne (she wears the same clothes almost every day) or even as stubborn as Dawn, who is more outgoing.

Kristy may be outgoing, but she is also a tomboy who loves to play softball. Kristy is the only girl in the seventh grade who has a steady boyfriend. His name is
