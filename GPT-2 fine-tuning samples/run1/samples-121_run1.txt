======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 of their parents? My Dad had said something about a lot of the parents being too young to work because they'd grown up in their parents' old house. She seemed to be right. So did my mom.

I can barely tell what my dad is calling me. And that's one of the things that makes me so different. I'm not a person of color. And I'm not even on the short side. I'm white. But that doesn't explain the way he dresses. I've always sort of looked like a girl at school, on TV, etc. Then the same thing happened. Suddenly, I was not only my opposite gender, but I was one of those very white, white girls who had to dress like a girl.

Here is the thing. No one is trying to force it on anybody, but it can have some negative impact on a person at once. When you reach a certain point (say, you're on the first date), something can get very mean. For example, it can make everybody around you look bad to everyone else. And when your hair gets super curly or your eyes get red in the sun, you may even get jealous.

For some reason the kids at Stoneybrook Public School are just as different and more complicated than the kids at my school. Stacey, for example, is a natural leader. She is quiet and sensitive. Her parents forbid her to speak to us all the time, but Stacey does not let that stop her. (I guess I could tell from that.) Stacey is outgoing and outgoing and sweet and soft-spoken. She can be mean to others â€” but not so to me. She's definitely a good listener, and I've grown into a good listener.

This is where the similarities end and the similarities begin. Stacey has two brothers: a younger one and a younger one. She's Japanese-American and has brown hair, blue eyes, and a soft, warm personality. My brothers love Stacey. Their favorite TV program is Mrs. Charlie, which is another family sitcom that has just so many mysteries.

Stacey's been married to her whole life. And she's got a younger sister (Mary Anne), and her step-sister (Jessi) lives with her mom and dad. She had a boyfriend when they met two years ago. Stacey decided to move across country, and she met her best friend, Dawn Schafer, who adopted her in seventh grade. Now, Dawn has never been to a wedding or a ballet class. Instead, they spend a lot of time reading and sketching their way around this complicated set of mysteries.

The mystery of Stacey's life is the one that started it all. She and her brothers got married, and the Thomases started moving around the country. Dawn moved to a big town over there (which was not my hometown), but her mom took her there as well. Now Stacey is the only parent in the country who has a steady job. Stacey's dad lives in New Jersey, and her mom and dad (who lives in California) and Mallory are also parents. They live with their younger brothers because they love our country and we can't help but think of the Thomases as close.

They're so close that in fact, they seem to be the only ones that can touch up our lives. Stacey knows a lot of people who have diabetes, and they can't even eat straight now and use the body the diabetes is causing them. For example, that diabetes isn't a lifelong disease, and it doesn't seem to affect them as much as I think the rest of us. We're not crazy about Stacey. She just wants more food, more clothing, and more time for her babies. Stacey's parents don't mind, either.

Another example of Stacey being so close to her brother and sister was when Stacey was just seven years old. Her dad had just met Dawn and he sent him to a wedding in California. That was when Stacey was the best friend of a new baby-sitter. I think her family was really lucky that Stacey's father lived there so much longer than his new neighbors. And I guess they do admire their kid. But that was before he met a lot of other kids with diabetes. And he met two older kids from his previous marriage. It was also the best time for Stacey to move to California. All that time she still attends a school where she's the president, so she had to take a lot of shots and miss out on opportunities to do something she does well.

Stacey is not as strict a person as her younger brother. She never gets too many junk food shots. On that occasion, she went for a chocolate-covered banana-covered tofu and a bar of instant oat tea. That's all she eats. But now that she's got the junk food fix, she's definitely taking shots lately.
