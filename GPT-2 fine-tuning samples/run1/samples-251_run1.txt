======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 take time to catch my breath. She'd run out onto the floor, her hair flying in the air as if she were going to land. Then she slammed the chair against the bed while she fell backward to her knees. Her eyes were full of tears. What was left of her body lay in a heap on the floor. "What?" asked Claudia. "What?" she asked Kristy. "What?" asked Deb, who had jumped to her knees and landed in a heap. Deb's body lay on the floor with her head caved in as Mr. Spier pulled up. His hands were everywhere except for his shirt. "I don't think I could." Deb said. He was beginning to panic, but I knew that Mr. Spier was holding her hand. Finally he shook her hand, took off his shirt, and said, "I'll handle it." I felt like the baby in bed. Deb and I had made each other look like the baby in bed. Then I thought, I'd have to be the baby in bed when Mary Anne came to the rescue.

A long, slow run down the hall followed. Then we reached the doorbell. Kristy was already in the hall, looking for Dawn. I was about to jump into the director's chair again, but she didn't move. She was just as frozen as before. She took up her position and began her run. I followed her like a deer and the steps she did so quickly were almost too short.

As I ran to the other end of the hall I wondered if I could see Dawn, but I wasn't able to. Kristy had taken the staircase. There was still traffic and some horses. "What are we doing?" Claudia asked. "I don't have time," I said. "At least I tried very hard not to be in the director's chair at that door." I had no idea what to think. Kristy wasn't the type to make you think anything. She'd seem a little cranky, but maybe she was just a little more stubborn. "I'll wait," she said.

When I made another run, I saw Claud and I fell flat. I lay motionless in the director's chair. I was so exhausted I couldn't move. Mary Anne was on the floor trying to run around.

When I was finished, Deb and I stepped into the director's chair. I couldn't believe it. My eyes were full of tears. I had to hide those dark, white eyes I almost always had.

Mary Anne reached over to hold out a pencil and began to paint something on the carpet. Her eyelids fell open as she began to paint a piece of paper. I knew what it really meant. It meant Dawn and I had escaped the director's chair. When Dawn made a half turn and looked at Mary Anne, she said, "Oh. Well, I guess the vice-president won't be able to take over my job for long, Mr. Spier." She took off her paper and laid it across Mary Anne's face.

I was so glad I had Dawn. A vice-president? We all thought so.

Mary Anne's hand went to Mary Anne's jaw and she began to pull away. She picked up her pencil and began to paint something on the carpet. Mary Anne's eyes filled with tears and closed her eyes, while her eyes continued to stare at the floor.

I was looking at Dawn and I felt as if I was inside a real horror show. Mary Anne, as the ghost of a real girl, had just emerged. She looked exactly like Mary Anne, at least her hair had been pulled up at the hairline, and her face had turned a little flushed. Mary Anne was wearing a sort of long, clear dress, which must have looked almost as if her body had been molded, as if by magic, into this wonderful, long, dark, silver, open dress.

Suddenly I felt as if I was in a dream. We were the last ones left, and that was because Dawn had just disappeared.

Mary Anne had arrived about five minutes earlier. And she looked so very new. She was dressed in the old, faded short sleeved blue of the great blue of the great red, in very little makeup. And she was still in the perfect shape.

Mary Anne and Dawn, who didn't always spend all their weekends at the house, had begun their run about five minutes later. Dawn was there wearing a blue blouse, a white shirt with a red bandeau, and a matching black skirt. She sat on the floor with her head held high up. Dawn seemed to be on the verge of being in a dream.

Mary Anne and Dawn opened the door to the director's chair. I saw it when I first started this experiment. In it I could see Mary Anne, Mary Anne, Mary Anne, Dawn, Mary Anne. The rest of them were
