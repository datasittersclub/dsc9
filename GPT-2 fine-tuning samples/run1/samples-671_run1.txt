t: the person I saw laughing makes it through the meeting.<|endoftext|>
“I hope the Braddocks have a date,” said Jessi.

“Kristy?” I repeated, looking as if I might faint.

The doorbell rang first. “Baby-sitters Club. This is Stacey.” The blonde, blue-eyed mom listened for a good while, then smiled as Kristy and Claudia arrived. Kristy is the president of the club. Her idea of a date was a picture of Mallory and a hamburger. She was the one who'd seen it on TV, and she smiled.

I looked at my watch.

Jessi and I looked at the clock. Our dates had arrived.

“Hi,” said Jessi as she sat down next to Mallory. “You guys are going to hear about our Baby-sitters Club, right?”

I looked at my watch.

“Jessi,” said Stacey, “I got this call from the Baby-sitters Club and the entire BSC is invited to be a BSC meeting.”

I sat down next to Mallory. “You know who’s the club? Mrs. Schafer. She thinks she’s being pulled out of the parents’ because she has an affair with her high school sweetheart and wants to stay in the California house she’s married to since her mom died in a car crash a few years ago.”

“Mrs. Schafer?” Mallory asked, glancing at one of the BSC officers.

Kristy rolled her eyes and put her hand over her heart.

“Sure,” said Kristy. “If she does decide to stay in the United States, she’s very much at your service. It means the A/C is off to a good start.”

I couldn’t blame Kristy for wanting to start a dating club. She and her club were not only very well organized, but they were just the best.

Kristy got this job and started getting flak for it. When she started complaining about the club, she was treated to a rambling, half-word (we’re supposed to get flaks for complaining, but nobody really knows what to say about Kristy or the idea of dating so little gets written up in our club record book.)

But now that I know Kristy better, I’m not so sure. That’s partly because she’s grown up in a more integrated family. And partly because her mom is as much a person as Kristy is a bird — a bird who says, I’m your parent. I told her I would baby-sit for any emergency involving my own baby-sitting service, and she agreed but said she wouldn’t call if I wasn’t sure.

She also became very shy, even going into her thirties to watch her father. (Kristy’s father is out of the picture. He has two children from a previous marriage, a boy and a girl, who just turned twenty-five.)

Still, Kristy can be a difficult parent to pin down. She’s such a good kid — and a smart one — that sometimes her sense of humor can be funny. Still, Kristy has had a rough life. You see, her father was a big baby-making goon.

Anyway, Kristy was pulled over for a moment as her mother, Dawn, was calling numbers her mother had made up for missing breathalyzer tests.

“Oh, no!” Kristy cried, waving her hand as her mother tried to contain her outburst. Then her mother said something pretty mean, just to make everybody laugh.

Dawn reached over and pulled out a roll of toilet paper and a box of Lace Tunes. “See you later,” she called, dropping them in the box.

We all ran off.

Dawn smiled at her, closing the car door behind her. “Thanks, Dad, but I really miss you, Mary Anne.” She ran to her closet and broke down crying into tiny pieces. “What an amazing day! First of all, thank goodness Dawn is so caring and supportive. Secondly, thank you, Dawn, for everything you do for the club. And finally —” she went on —’I miss you very much, Dawn.”

We all laughed so hard that before the meeting knew whether they could stop laughing, Claudia gave her a Look and said, “Mom,” before we started to laugh.

Luckily, that was almost
