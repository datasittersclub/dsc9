, and he had the best haircut I ever heard.

But before I tell you that day, there was one other thing I should tell you about. I had just gotten off the phone a call from a new girl whom I just now caught.

That new girl was just being announced, and I could feel myself shaking my head. She sounded like a new girl who was planning to spend some time in the mall with a killer shopping list. Mallmallows were something to keep in your cart during introductions. You know, pretzels, hot chocolate, milk moccasins, red hots, something. When I looked up, I saw that Kristy — and I already know her best friend — was holding a TON of red gum out of her mouth. She must have been the last person to ask, as I backed out of my other work at the last minute.

So, were the new girls in our club new girls? She kind of seemed like the type that could be bossy. But, I guess, someone who is as forceful as Kristy is.

Anyway, that day was spent in the shop, checking out the lollipop boxes and eating lunch. I made friends with Mary Anne, and we even made a game of it. I noticed that Stacey was the only one not eating lunch. I asked her how it was caused by the allergens in her blood, and she said it reminded her of school.

Okay, time for a serious quiz.

How old was Kristy when she acquired her allergies?<|endoftext|>
"Are you okay?" Claudia Kishi demanded, turning to me. "Are you taking any injections?"

My complexion was terrible.

"Don't you have to inject me," I insisted. "Is this the seventh grade at Montefiore's?"

"No, sir," Mary Anne Spier said. "It's almost twelve. It's more like the third or fourth grade."

"And it must be worse than regular eighth grade," I pointed out. "You know, like the eighth grade."

"But the grades are different," Kristy blurted out. "So why aren't you telling us the reason?"

"Why don't you take a little more time to get to know Claudia," I suggested. "We have already started to take the test. But how exactly is it you and Claudia working on that problem? And you mention Stacey, I think you'll like that, too. So I don't know, I guess it's a good sign."

"Good thing I can take the test first," Claudia insisted. "If you don't mind if I ask, I'll let you in, though." But I wasn't sure what to do in Claudia's room.

It was five-thirty, so I was alone. I looked around the room. The other club members had arrived. There were Mary Anne's older sister, Janine, and Logan, the newest member. But only Janine had left. Logan and Mary Anne were sitting on the floor, looking like babies.

"What's wrong?" Kristy asked, looking around more deeply. "Why don't you come along and help out and help a little?"

I tried to compose myself, but I don't remember much more than, "I just recently came across a very cute video of a ballet dancer practicing to perform in front of a camera." I looked at Claud, who was scowling.

"The video is absolutely gorgeous!" I cried.

Claud shook her head, leaning back and gesturing to a picture of a dancing performance. "That video has some very interesting details," she said. After looking at my picture, she smiled weakly. "Now if I had to choose between dancing with a famous dancer and a baby, it would probably be this David Michael guy."

"So cute!" I exclaimed.

Claudia nodded. She leaned forward, holding out a small bag of organic broccoli noodles. "I'll teach you, though, something special is going on here, something very interesting," she said, looking at Mary Anne.

"You guys are the only club members who have the same hairstyle," Janine teased.

"Why?" I asked.

Janine groaned. "I'm the vice-president for the BSC, because I'm the only one with a true shot of getting the word 'fashionable' to say it all, in addition to being the only one with the greatest idea of all about five hundred words."

"But you already told us who we would recruit," Stacey McGill said, pulling a stack of brochures out of her bag.

"You told Jessi and me!" Kristy retorted. "We're going to need some new members."

"New members are people who are
