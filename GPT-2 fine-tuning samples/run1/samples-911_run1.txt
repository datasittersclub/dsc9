oney, not just the title but the position. Mary Anne is quiet, studious, and sensitive. She’s an excellent listener and is very sensitive. In short, she’s a caring, caring, caring baby-sitter.

Mary Anne began work on Monday, December 1st. While she waited for her digital clock to update her social media accounts, she collected dues from us and doled out money to Claud on a case by case basis. As treasurer, treasurer, and founder of the Baby-sitters Club, I collect the dues every Monday. (The money is spent on items for the club notebook.) What does this mean? Well, our club treasurer, who’s never held office but whose job is mostly filled with parents who need a baby-sitter (because they contact us during off-hours), keeps track of the money in our treasury. What we do with the money is up to the member, but dues are a big part of the club.

That’s right. All members. All good ideas. We enjoy baby-sitting jobs and pay very well with kids. But in case you’re wondering, dues are no hardship. We earn enough money to cover club expenses so don’t be surprised if we need to cut costs.

Stacey and I are the two most satchety of all of us, though. We share a passion for health food and don’t care too much about our looks. We are both short, but we are pretty different. We look a lot alike, with our brown eyes and brown hair — but I’m Stacey and I’sef Ramsey and I don’t actually have any hair on our heads.

I’m Stacey. Not exactly a tall girl but I like my position. I’m a short person, like Stacey. I don’t necessarily have to wear the most trendy clothes, if at all, but if I’d need anything for a period of time the Ramsey family would be mad. Would they come to us? Probably not. But wouldn’t phone companies turn a blind eye to us if they had reason to love short people?

They would. We’ll buy you a short conversation, call you back, and then spend our money on our favorite snacks — and a ton of Ring Dings and Smart Flavors in the popcorn.

I’ll begin by saying that I have a pretty healthy opinion of Stacey’s hair. It’s a beautiful blonde one, almost white, with freckles and straightened shoulders. I like it that way. Also, I like the way she wears makeup. It makes her hair bouncy and adds to the elegance of her figure.

The other best friend of Dawn is Mary Anne. They grew up together and grew apart. Neither of them talks about boys, but they have been best friends forever. (No, we didn’t have to pick fights.) Mary Anne is the mother of two kids from her previous marriage, who are both deaf. (Is that a weird question or a sad joke?) Her other kid, Rebecca, is going to be a writer and illustrator of children’s books when she grows up. Mary Anne, by the way, is Dawn’s stepsister! She’s also close to her family, which includes her father, who is divorced, and Jeff, who just happens to be Mary Anne’s other best friend.

You probably want to know about Mary Anne and her family first, because when Dawn became homesick for eighth grade, she met Dawn’s family in high school. They broke up, only their car was so cluttered it filled up. That was when Dawn met and became friends with Mary Anne, who is forever home to reading books. Dawn’s a real math whiz, so it was a good thing, too. Since that meeting, she’s driven out of town for California. She’s back in Stoneybrook now, but it was just before the new year started.

What about Mary Anne? Well, Dawn and Mary Anne got to be best friends, and they kind of became stepsisters, too. But Jeff never adjusted to life in Connecticut, and he’s back in California. (I feel bad for him. He used to be Mary Anne’s best friend, but he didn’t grow up with Mary Anne.) So now Dawn and Mary Anne can rest easy knowing that they are close, too.

Back to Mary Anne and Dawn. I had Dawn in my life long before Mary Anne met me. Back then she lived on Long Island. She’d been there until the divorce. Then she and Sharon moved to Connecticut, which is a pretty sad place, but it gave Dawn a home. She has an eight
