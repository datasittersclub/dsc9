’ll come right to you.” Mary Anne said. The room exploded with cheers.

“Dawn! Dawn!” I cried.

Mary Anne turned to us, and we hugged her.

It was nearly five o’clock when my mom called the meeting to order.

“Any business?” she asked.

“Dues dayen!” I replied.

“Oh, dear,” Dad repeated. “Order. … uh-huh…. … mm-huh…. Um…. mm-huh…. … mm-huh…. Uh-huh. Uh-155, uh-huh. Uh-190, uh-huh. Uh-195, uh-huh. Uh-195. Uh-195. Uh-195. Wanna dance class? You little slobberers…. Huh? Um. Uh-huh. Uh-huh…. Um. What? What do you mean? Um. You little children…. Okay, fine. I'll explain. The first thing you need to know is whether you or your child are in the dance class. What part of the job does Dawn teach? How to play the piano? How to say kata? (She knows some of them, but she doesn’t spell them in kata, I guess, since it’s more like a pedagogy game.) You decide. She gets to know me pretty well. We’ve even gone bowling.

Okay, enough talking,” said Dad.

“Any business?” he asked.

“Dues dayen!” I breathed a sigh of relief. Mom and I are the two highest-earner club members.

My mom handed me off to Mary Anne. She put her binder to her sides, picked out a handful of pretzels, and handed it over to Claud. “Any club business to-do’ers to-do list.”

After a quick glance at the calendar, Claud sorted out what day the ballet class would be held. She’d been clubbing all week, until Dawn moved away, and then she took the job of filling in the calendar.

I had to admit, I liked it easier than Claud. It meant I didn’t have to worry about any of my ballet classes being affected by whatever moves Dawn had scheduled for me.

Claudia didn’t have any special obligations — all she had to do was keep track of her schedule in the book. And Dawn does, which is to say, be on time. She has tons of practice stretches, after-school activities, and daytime jobs. But she doesn’t have to. She just has to.

Take me for example. I was back in the eighth grade and still in eighth grade right now, but I wasn’t moving around much. Instead I was in seventh grade. (I was the alternate in the eighth grade even though my real name is Nannie.) Anyway, one member of the BSC doesn’t have to worry about anything. She can take remedial dance classes at the local community college — and she sure seems interested.

We call this girl Dawn Porter. What she’s really passionate about is health food and healthy eating. She’s a diabetic, which means she has to watch her diet and eat very carefully. She also has to give herself injections of insulin every day and to get off the junk food. She doesn’t like it either, but she says it’s part of her job.

Dawn is also in the sixth grade, but she’s not a major student. That’s because she has a really hard time dealing with her age (I guess you’d call her thirteen, even though) and her parents don’t approve of either her idea for a younger audience or her grades. (They’re not against my idea. I told her about it earlier, but I don’t like to have kids.) Anyway, Dawn has a great sense of humor.

But I guess I always look forward to my next job. I guess it’s when I’ll decide whether to stay in California or go to California permanently.

“Dues day!” my mom shouted from the phone.

“Yes!” I managed a tiny smile. “Let’s see, Stace!” she said.

“Thanks! I didn’t see you that afternoon.” Stacey dialed Dawn’s number.

“Thanks!” Stace said.

“You’ll never guess who we have!” she asked.
