 order at the same time. She couldn’t sit at night and watch her brothers and sisters play. (Before she became a BSC member, Jessi was a softball player for Tigger’s Krushers.) Jessi also loves sports. In fact, she was in the sixth grade at Kristy’s high school. Then, while she was in seventh grade, Kristy’s mom was trying to get him to read and re-apply, so Jessi’s father even picked her up late one night on a cold night in school and ripped her open so open he’d have to be bitten, like, to death. (A cold? That’s what Jessi thinks. The doctors said so.) Anyway, when Mr. Thomas got back from Christmas with Mrs. Thomas, he bit into Jessi’s closed fist. He didn’t pull out, he bent over and take a bite. (He couldn’t eat the same thing twice. That was cruel.)

Anyway, as you know, Jessi has a younger sister and a baby brother. That really is bigger than Jessi’s father. Mr. Thomas always wanted Jessi to go to Stoneybrook Community School.

Mr. Thomas raised Jessi with all kinds of problems — single parent, very demanding, strict, demanding, demanding. When he got to seventh grade, he got rid of just about every crumbly, crinkle-covered corner of his mind, including the fact that, for the eighth grade, Jessi couldn’t wear the nunchunchies, except in school. (No one ever asked Mr. Thomas to take one, but he said no because "the nunchies’ were just too big.")

Jessi is the oldest kid in her family. She has seven younger brothers and sisters! And, although her mom is not a writer, he has written and drawn pictures of himself on the candy wrapper of a Crayon-Thomas shirt (which is sort of a vest) every day since birth.

Jessi’s passion is ballet. She has danced leading roles in local musicals. And, although she is tall (at 5 feet and with blue eyes and curly, straight shoulder-length blonde, she’s got style) she is likable, even great listener. She’s sensitive (ask me, if I were an actor my age, I’m pretty sure I’m going to cry), and hilarious. She tells the truth — her dad beat her up over the weekend because she didn’t follow his curfew (eat whichever you want, stick 'em in your gullet, etc.).

Jessi and Mal are best friends. They’re both the oldest of two siblings. And, believe it or not, both thought their parents were bossy at first, at least until they found that their parents actually wanted to be better parents.

As you might have guessed, Jessi is African-American. She’s the oldest in a genuine family of her own, and her family is as big as Mal’s (the family — Jessi’s mom; her older brothers, younger sister, and baby brother, Andrew; and her eight siblings plus a very, very complicated (thank goodness) triplet).

Mal is Caucasian. She has a half sister and brother. (It’s still a mystery to everybody else why they’re there. They’re in high school, my friends and I are in high school. When Mal’s father was killed in a car accident when Jessi was only a baby, Jessi became the first of the BSC members to go to the hospital in hospital, to look at him, to give him a very, very quick, very serious plastic surgeon check-up, to give him a sitter baby-sitter in less than an hour, to talk to Mallory and baby-sitter after baby-sit for awhile.

In Mal’s case, she has lost a sister and brother in the accident, and she doesn’t want one, but she tries to make herself very welcome there.

So that’s the BSC. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? It is. It’s not hard to remember now, but the people in it are the best I’ve ever met. Oh, well, you know the members.

Okay. On to the club I’ve been in since the beginning, which is why I couldn’t stop talking about you guys. Today had the most wonderful thing in the world.

Oh, there it was. Chocolate-covered peanuts and juicy cheddar onions and the smell of peanut butter were all around me.

Hmmm. I was on the verge of giving myself a seizure.
