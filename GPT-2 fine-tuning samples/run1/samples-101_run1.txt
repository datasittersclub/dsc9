======== SAMPLE 1 ========
. We meet the next Monday, June 5 from 5:30-6:30, in a little kitchen in the back of our apartment. They have a separate room for all our meetings. And we'll have more than enough snacks. The kids are the coolest friends in school!

The kids who are really lucky! I hope I did all the math. But I have one major gripe with them. I don't think Claudia is as smart as I am. At the moment she's one of the hardest-working kids in school. She's the most caring person in the room, even though the family — including her mom, Kristy's grandmother, and her younger brother Michael, Jr. — is full of kids who are in pain already. They are addicted to painkillers and have trouble keeping up with their siblings. The only time anyone calls Claudia Kristy, it's because her mother died at the age of eleven.

So Claudia does just fine. She lives near Claudia's brother, Andrew, and steps for a couple of reasons. Because they're divorced. Because Kristy's younger than Kristy's dad — she's an incredible mother. (The two of them are triplets.) Kristy and Claudia are also married, to a guy who's been in the business for over three years, Jeff.

It all comes home to me. This is a job I'm excited to join. I think it's perfect, and I hate sitting, because I don't like sitting all day. (As if I thought about that. I love sitting so much.) But you should still get good form, and good timing. And be right in front of the camera. I have to admit, I can't stand sitting, even if I really think it's great. And as you can see, it's not easy to sit at night — even though that's exactly what I am.

Maybe it's because I am a tomboy, and most of the time even my parents think I don't look good in clothes or in makeup. And they don't mind. They know I'm cute, smart, and I love to read. To them, I'm the most gorgeous kind of person, even though I'm very shy and shy. As you know, most of us are tomboys, though one thing that bothers me is my older sister, Janine. Well, Janine is the oldest of us, and she has a younger sister, Tiffany. She's almost as smart as Claudia, and is practically a sixth grade girl. And there aren't many things that compare. Not even Janine has a bad opinion of me. She just happens to have a bad opinion of her. I can't speak for anyone else and I won't, and I can at least tell you Kristy, Janine, or me wouldn't approve. Anyway, I just love Janine. Even though she's just an immature little girl who's always playing with the clothes and the toys, she's smart as a nut and is super careful with her movements and her expression. She's perfect with her hair and her complexion. She makes sure to hide it all out so it looks pretty.

Her clothes have a long history in Kristy's life. I can understand how that can be intimidating, but she's the only one of us who wears her hair in pigtails when she walks. And she always has her hair turned down as a style (yes, sometimes it's even been in braids, to keep her ears clean). I understand that this is a great idea. I have an image of Janine, and a lot of her best friends, including me, are sittingters. To them, it's probably because they're the only ones who can take out jobs in a very short amount of time. Plus, sitting is one of the main reasons Janine wants Emily Michelle to come to college. She was like, "I need to go to an art school where I can study." Which is a great idea, and not a bad one either. She's so nice and soft and fun and cool. (Which is one of the reason she's such a good friend.)

Besides, Janine and Emily Michelle are thirteen and in the eighth grade. They look more like us kids than they do. They also have brown eyes, and they have huge mouths and large red nose. I mean, you could call any of them that —”

Claudia speaks at me so fast that it sounds like a baby. I take the moment.

"I know," I say firmly.

"Then, in all seriousness, I should be working on my reading!" Claudia says.

"That," I say, glancing at the clock. "We'd better get this started."

"Let's try," says Janine. "I'm in Stoneybrook." She drives off like a rocket across town.

"Stoneybrook?" I ask.
