, she would do anything for Milk Dud. Her mom is a strict parent and Kristy has shown no mercy toward her older sister, Janine the Genius.

Jessi’s family, if you have ever heard, is mixed. Mostly, it’s white, with only one black parent and one mixed-up black parent. But there are also a couple of minority families, and a few mixed-up families.

One of them is Winslow’s, which is basically — her dad's company. You could say the family has split up because of Jessi’s family. But Jessi’s family is much bigger than Jessi’s. Jessi’s family has seven younger siblings, including triplet brothers and triplets younger than them. Jessi’s family also has a new sister, a stepsister, and a baby brother.

How Jessi acquired that family name is a mystery. One is that her father used to marry Mr. Brewer when she was small. That happened some time after Jessi’s birth, when Jessi was still one shy boy shy of Kristy. At the time, Kristy thought Kristy’s idea was cool; Jessi’s mother was very unhappy. Her father pulled the family into the BSC, so Jessi and Mal moved in with Kristy and her family. Mal is now a full-time BSC member; she was transferred to another neighborhood. Here, Mrs. Thomas was the one who finally let Jessi and Mal live together. Mal had only known Kristy a little while ago, when they had become close, so she feels very welcome with all the newcomers.

Jessi’s great at math, which tells us a little about her family. Mal is the oldest of five children; Kristy, who is now college president; Jessi, who is black, and Adam, who is white. (Jessi has dark hair, reddish-brown eyes, and a body that reminds her of a stuffed animal.)

So, if you walked into a meeting with a picture of Kristy Thomas at the top, you’d be panicking. Well, you wouldn’t. But you wouldn’t look at the family in that moment, especially if Kristy were living with ease and justice under a strict father and uncle.

No, the moment was odd. Kristy and her older brothers and friends were gathered in a room that looked like a courtroom. And, boy, was it crowded. There were four or five kids — Kristy, Dawn, her younger brother, Jeff, and her baby brother, John Philip, Jr. — all clustered around a table. Suddenly, the idea of aunts and uncles seemed pretty important.

“Let’s get some new sitters,” said Kristy. “Right away. We need new clients.”

Kristy led the way to Dawn’s room, where she stopped and turned away, Mary Anne invited Mary Anne to sit, Jessi and I did. As Mary Anne sat, her red hair was pulled back over her face, her thumbs were pressed over her ears, and her glasses were on top of her head. She was smiling at everyone.

Then Dawn came in. She’s Dawn’s neighbor in California; Kristy’s best friend. Dawn is also outgoing, funny, and energetic, and she often gives Kristy a run for her money. She has tons of friends, but she always has the worst clothes. (Some of them are nicer than others.)

Dawn’s style is conservative, but she wears her hair pulled back in a short braid. She doesn’t eat sweets, and she has a super-early bedtime, so she enjoys health food eating and lots of sunshine (yes, sunshine, in that gross way she adores the BSC headquarters, which is her bedroom).

I’m the club treasurer, which is sort of like a full-time job. I’m in charge of collecting dues each Monday. When we use the money to pay Charlie to drive Kristy to the meeting, we use it to restock our Kid-Kits. Those are our old toys that we get when we have lots of jobs, plus new ideas for keeping kids entertained.

What kind of kid would we be? Six foot-two, fair skin, with brown hair and eyes. I wouldn’t have a problem with that, but it would make me nervous. I mean, I would want to know why our club got so much work. And how it ended.

The important part of my job is getting to know the club members. Kristy is the club secretary, and it appeared for her job because she’s a tomboy. The five of us attended
