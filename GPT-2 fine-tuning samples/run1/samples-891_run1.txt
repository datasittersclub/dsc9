 similarities. She’s an associate member. “I’ll tell you guys, guys, and slob that day,” she announced.

Kristy looked at me expectantly. “Yes?” she asked, as she pulled her purse from beneath her hats.

I shrugged. “I don’t know how my mom and Watson got married, but they were very strict.”

“They couldn’t get a divorce,” I went on.

“You will?”

Kristy nodded. “It was their mom. She wanted to get rid of all her children, including Tigger, and he’d gone his way. And they’ve kind of changed a lot in the last couple of months.”

“It’s not just her! It’s her stepsister and next-of-kin,” I said with a grin.

“Another family altogether,” replied Kristy, rolling up her manila envelope.

“So, who is that’s going to be?” asked Mary Anne.

We started laughing as we learned that our surprise was a real quadruple — Jessi, Mal and their mom.

“I could ask my parents to call my best friend, my stepsister, my stepsister’s new best friend, and their friend in law, since that would take all the talking.”

“I’m already at the dinner party!” I exclaimed.

“All in one afternoon!” shouted Dawn.

“Do they still have Marilyn? No, they don’t.”

“Marilyn and I are in the same jujubes,” joked Kristy.

It didn’t take long to find the articles. “That’s totally cool. We were looking for a date.”

“Mansion! Is it true?” asked Mary Anne.

“Mansion, actually,” said Stacey. “It’s in an old house on the edge of town. Marilyn liked it, so she called Shannon and invited Shannon to join. Then the triplets found out that Marilyn had been unfaithful to them and had only gone back in her old house to live with her new husband. Marilyn and I were so excited!”

“Marilyn and I were hoping you and Shannon, Mary Anne,” Jessi added with a smile.

“We were, too!” said Mal. “It’s a true story.<|endoftext|>
I got off the phone with my girlfriend, Margo. We talked about our baby-sitting charges a little, but first I had to talk to Shannon, who lives across the street. She told me everything we were thinking about.

She said, “We don’t have a lot of baby-sitting left,” meaning no sitters available, that's why we should be working on that. I said, “We don’t need anyone to deal with what we have now.”

“What do you mean? Work on it?” asked Mal.

I went on, “I don’t know yet. But I could probably start a baby-sitting club soon. Right now I’m in the seventh grade, so my friends are in eighth grade. Most of the other kids in the group are eighth-graders, so I don’t know if that will work out, either. The six of us are different in kind, but we like each other and we like having our children around. We don’t want to make any new friends, anyway.”

“You’re making us feel better about not having enough work?” I teased. “I don’t mean to be—”

Dawn shook her head. “I don’t mean to sound negative. I mean “I don’t want to be part of the problem. I want to do my homework.”

“Well, that’s good,” I said.

“Have fun!” asked Kristy.

I did. What would I have to do? This was going to be fun. I mean, what if my friends could just do whatever they liked? It would be easy. The job would just be to ask the four of us to do something. We could do it. Even if we didn’t have a club, we’d be happy to know it was an
