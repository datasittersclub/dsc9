======== SAMPLE 1 ========
�s mom’s marriage broke down. Mrs. Schafer got divorced and she remarried my mom, giving me Dawn. Dawn missed California and her dad so much that she went back there to live with her ex-husband. (She misses him immensely.) I helped look after her, and it had become so overwhelming for me to not have Dawn available for appointments anymore.

Before Dawn moved, we lived in New York City together. That’s where she discovered our love for horse racing.

“Did Kristy hear about this?” Dawn asked.

(Becca, who is Mary Anne’s little sister, and as close as two people can get.)

(Sniff, sniff, and pout sounds.) No way.

“Kristy’s the president of the Baby-sitters Club,” Claudia said.

“Oh. Yeah.” Jessi swallowed a mouthful of a pretzel and sighed. (Becca and I — I’m junior officers and she is also president and tries toast, and has two holes pierced in each ear —” Claudia kept pointing.) 'See, one day in the seventh grade, a group of eighth-graders was listening to their parents make phone call after phone call trying to find a sitter for Kristy’s little brother.”

Jessi and Claudia both liked the idea. They were determined to make it happen. How many parents could they reach? How many people could they please? They got signed up in a special program called Happily Ever After. So-called sitters just had to advertise.

As president, Jessi led the charge. Mostly. As I’ve said, she’s always outgoing and caring. She is the type of person who stays calm during a crisis and puts things in perspective after a problem.

Jessi’s father died in a car wreck when Jessi was little. (Her mother died when the Ramseys were young.) Jessi usually seems calm, and I can certainly understand that. Her father is a crazed, out-of-control-life wimp. He had to work really, really hard to bring up his daughter.

Mr. Spier seems very old headed, mainly because Jessi’s mother died when he was in the house. He’s a real, live maniac. You can practically hear him gesticulating and laughing. In the back of his bedroom cabinet, on Claud’s wall, sits a bowl of broccoli, a vegetable pot, a lid on which are perched a handful of chocolate glazed marshmallows, two Hershey rings, a bag of potato chips, a bottle of orange juice, a couple of wax paper clips.

One of our jobs in the club is to schedule all our sitting jobs. We keep records and note all our conflicts in our club notebook, in which we each keep a calendar of what’s happening in our club — and how they feel. For example, today I had a little trouble finding Kristy’s bra-thumper, a sporty thing, on the dollhouse floor, but I’d come up with a great idea. I’d painted a big map of Victoria Plath’s neighborhood, with street names, holy grails, holy sites. I’d then hung a photo of the city and included the information on the map. That way I was in charge, no matter where I sat.

The notebook was also a big help. Not only was it filled with entries about my baby-sitting jobs, but we were so happy to be able to take on a baby-sitter. It gave Kristy tons of inspiration. She’s a big shot.

“Kristy?” Kristy sounded worried.

“I’m taking care of a cat,” I replied.

“She likes it,” said Kristy.

“Yeah?” asked Claudia.

“She loves kittens,” I said.

“Really?” said Stacey, reaching for the phone. “Do you have your kitten? He’s so cute.”

“I’m taking care of him,” I told Stacey.

“Okay,” said Kristy. “Then cats.” She bit into the last leaf of the leaf, as if she’d seen something happen.

With a smile, Kristy was off.

Claudia Kishi is another BSC member. Like Claudia, she is an artistic genius. She’s always trying to come up with something original that nobody else can — and that’s just what she does. She�
