 person, to be an officer with the BSC. “How could we be so divided?” she asked after I finished speaking.

“The club’s had a meeting this afternoon,” Kristy mused as she called the meeting to order. “Just wanted an extension.” She shrugged. “We can go right back.”

“I don’t know what to do,” I reminded her. “I have to watch what we do. We need to talk to the club.”

Kristy looked surprised.

Claudia could hardly hold it against. She’d joined us, and I was, too.

“We’re not all in the same category,” Kristy said as we drove down the dark stretch of I-95. “We’re both in the same category.” Claudia spoke with concern.

Claudia didn’t seem to notice us. She took the lead, gesturing with one ear to the other. Then, as we reached an intersection, Claudia said, “This is the most wonderful thing. I can talk with either of them forever.”

I gave her some of my best Southern hospitality. She kept her cool, as usual.

Claudia doesn’t just sit for Kristy. We sit for other people too. That is, if we think they are the best sitters. (I think they are better than Kristy.)

We sit because we believe in it. Let us do it.

Kristy is one of my all-time favorite people. Her ideas are so strong, I think even I miss her.

She was born in New York City. She moved to Stoneybrook at the beginning of seventh grade. (I think she was in seventh grade when she moved to Stoneybrook City.) Kristy has always been a city girl. She’s a member of the Baby-sitters Club, the BSC, the American Astronomical Society, and the American Trust. And she’s the only one of the BSC member who has been to the Olympics in under two years.

We’re not the world’s busiest club. That’s because Kristy and Mom and I are so busy. We’ve been able to baby-sit on extremely few jobs. And, as I mentioned, we’re both in the first grade.

When I first met Kristy, I’d thought she was a doll. I also thought she had that wild look that makes you want to rip off her hair. Kristy is very special. She’s Japanese-American, has brown eyes with dark silky, silky skin, and she’s extremely sophisticated.

Claudia is always going to come up with something funny or striking to say about us. In the club record book — the perfect guide for a baby-sitter — there’s one important “date number. “If I go to the meeting, I can make a list of the available dates. I may want to attend on the last day. You can find the date at any meeting.”

How do we make a calendar? Well, remember the date? Well, she’s secretary, I’m alternate officer, I’m alternate captain. Kristy always sets out a calendar in her head. One day she plans on having seven children (including triplets!) available on her person: Stacey, Claudia, her seven brothers, Stacey and Sam, and Stacey’s younger siblings, Claudia (two, Sam, a seven-year-old boy, who just turned seven), Claudia and her younger brother, Philip (eleven, Sam and a baby brother, Philip). Kristy also wants to do something special with the kids she has in the BSC, so she organized the Kid-Kits, which are boxes, boxes, with our Kid-Books. We always have at least one Kid-Kit in the club; they are small, useful stuff that we hand-me-downs along the way. We have more than enough boxes scattered around the club, and we keep track of how much we earn by reading the Kid-Kits. If we earn enough money, we can put up a banner in support of our club, or print materials to help out, or pay for things like that. And if the money comes in enough money, we can design a cool new club poster.

Kristy also has one of the most amazing outfits, one that her parents put up for us baby-sitters at once. It’s a very casual, casual outfit for an A-list kid. We keep the poster up-to-date with all the major BSC
