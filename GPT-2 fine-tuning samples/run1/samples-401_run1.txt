 older, or something. I was really excited about the first game.

I ran into my coach, Watson Brewer. I don’t like coaches — I always find them a little bossy. He’s very easygoing, and he’s the president of the Brewers. He runs an organization, and he insists on being official — a baseball hat, a tie-dyed sweater, pants, and a baseball cap.

I was wearing that baseball cap in disguise. It was almost red in color. It had an overhang of green that looked like a wild Hawaiian tree. Watson’s name was in the top right corner — and underneath, a yellow stripe ran along the back. It looked like the middle finger of his finger. The phrase “club president” came in next to it. I guessed it meant “president of the United States, duty president,” especially since he’s the president of the Brewers baseball team since 1905.

“When the meeting was over I went to Watson’s office to call him back.” I don’t usually call people when I call people, but in this case, it was Watson Brewer. (I used to live across the street from Claudia, and he calls when I do talk to him.) When Watson’s home was at least five or six o’clock I hopped on my bike. At that moment, I was sitting in my usual spot on my front stoop.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club! Hello, Mrs. Rodowsky! Hi,” I greeted Mary Anne, and Karen Brewer, who was still sitting down on the floor next to me.

“Hi,” I greeted Mary Anne, and Karen Brewer, who was still sitting down on the floor next to me.

“That’s good,” said Karen, “there was a baby at the Rodowskys house. Mrs. Rodowsky has a new husband, David Michael, and Karen’s older sister, Emily Michelle. (Karen’s grandmother Nannie was an important part of the Rodowskys household.)”

Mary Anne and Karen waved at me, then Watson, and walked over. Watson was carrying a backpack he made himself. “Watson,” he began, “that’s a great kid. I know he’s going to be so immature. I know he’s going to be a really bad parent.” He put his hands on my shoulders, and I felt as if I had taken a baby from my own home into Watson’s arms. A baby who I’d just met! Watson’s a big jerk, and I’d never seen him give you anything like that.

“David Michael?” exclaimed Karen. “Did you see what happened today? He was really pushy.” She looked at Mary Anne. “He said it was a toddler,” she began, “and I said “the best way to raise a toddler in the world is with a sitter. Can you believe that’s exactly what Karen called?”

“I mean,” said Mary Anne suddenly. “He went straight out of character today.”

“Well,” I began, “He said it was a toddler,” I added, “but I was saying it wasn’t a grown-up one, by the way.”

There, in another corner, was a tiny bundle of baby-sitting materials. “Ahem.” Karen’s mother, who was wearing a tie-dyed shirt, a bright yellow baby-sitting belt, and a red baseball cap which said “Mitts Candy” on it. “She has two little ones named Shannon and Anna.”

“Shannon,” I offered. “She’d be adorable with those big orange ears.” The kids at first did not like me giving Shannon and Anna her ears, but then they’re really nice.

“I’ll bring them in two at a time,” said Karen.

“Two?” I asked.

“Nope. They’ll be in my ears.” I picked up Karen’s baseball cap, handed it over, and led the way to the living room. My eyes were watering a moment later when the Rodowskys were waiting for us in the kitchen.

Mary Anne came running in as well. She looked like it was no time to begin the meeting. “Mrs. Rodowsky just called.” Mrs. Rodowsky likes to meet,
