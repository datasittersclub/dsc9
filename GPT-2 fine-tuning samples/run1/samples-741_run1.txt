, Kristy told me she thought it was so weird for someone to bring a bottle of blood to a meeting and then pour it into the mouth of a bag of potato chips? No way! I told her about the trip, and the rest of the junk food had just disappeared into the fridge.

Still, even though the rest of the BSC members seemed a little less than happy about this, I figured Kristy would probably be about to have some of her biggest words describe her. She was still smiling.

“Hey, Logan!” she exclaimed.

Claudia, Dawn, and Mary Anne exchanged glances and shook their heads. Kristy, who is a tomboy, and Mary Anne were as shy as Claudia and me. They were even a little more likely than me to have a boyfriend (most of the time).

“We love you!” said Kristy.

“I tried!” said Dawn.

“You’re great!” said Mallory.

But some in the BSC were already expecting me to be happy were surprised that I actually was happy. I suppose it’s true that I like people’s reactions, too. I like being happy. It’s also true that I like being happy outside of relationships. I always find it really interesting that people sometimes treat me differently when I feel the same way about them — and when that treats turn out to be wrong.

It is all true that I like being with people and having a good time better than I do being with food or having bad food or having homework. I’m not the world’s happiest person or a person who can get lost in a movie the minute you call her. (I don’t mind that.)

But I feel better about almost all the things that go along with being happiest. Things like eating health-food, reading The New York Times, and being environmentally conscious.

And, most important, I feel happy about being able to have a baby. I feel happy that I have a baby sister who is exactly as I am, and that my family — my friends, my beloved ones — can now have a steady supply of siblings.

Just kidding. I think the best words I can come up with for happy babies are, “Thanks for everything,” and “Feed me,” (whatever that is). That’s probably what my friends thought of my last Cuddle up, but it sure felt good to hear from them. I didn’t know their mom, but I knew my siblings. And I felt better about being happy.

When I get home from my meeting, I spend a lot of my time on the porch. In fact, I spent a weekend with my BSC friends recently. That was fun — and probably one of the reasons I finished up my last Cuddle up. But all the other things that keep me happy are food, sleep, and … well, anything that lets off some of my nerves.

By the way, don’t ever think I just feel happy just because I’m in my thirties. I love having a baby and I’m only only doing it because I’m a baby. And being the oldest baby in my family means I have plenty of family to give Mom and her perfect storm of good ideas.

You see, Mom and Dad have been getting this domineering from a long time. Back in high school, things were pretty normal. Dad wasn’t trying hard — just very hard, for reasons I haven’t quite explained, but mostly just because Mom was unhappy with her second marriage and she missed her brother Charlie.

As Stacey McGill, one of the BSC members my age, told me about that night at my first meeting, everyone laughed.

I grinned back.

Then I noticed a man with curly reddish-brown hair walking up the stairs. I giggled a little and looked at my friends.

“Hey, that’s me,” said he. “Hey,” I said.” I was still laughing a little. “Sorry,” I said. “But that’s me.”

“Kristy!” he shouted. “What did you think of my baby-sitting this morning? A bunch of first-graders by the name of Blaine Marshall? I missed a lot of baby-sitting. You were awful, Blaine.”

“You missed me,” I confessed. “I don’t fault you, Blaine.”

“But Dad, you weren’t the only one who missed me, were you?”

“Yes.
