 live in the house right across the street from Claudia’s. I’m not there yet, though; my father has just announced we all go to Stoneybrook Middle School.” (That was the name Stacey gave her when a friend of Kristy’s came to town earlier for a BSC meeting.)

“Where did they get that information?” Stacey asked us.

Mal said, “In our club record book, we take good care of that.” (That made sense, since it was Stacey who thought up it.)

Everyone groaned. We all agreed that it was important to Kristy. The BSC isn’t a perfect solution to a problem. I guess that doesn’t make it perfect. Kristy’s a very organized person, but I don’t think she even knows how to find the right people in her own right … or to get right to the point. As president, she keeps a close eye on things and does a good job of it.

Mal said she was glad she had the job. “I don’t know how many more years it is—” she began.

“And we know that it’s going to take some time,” Stacey reminded us. “but Kristy thinks it might be a year.”

“Kristy, it’s a long time,” Jamie said. I thought he was the first to be a little embarrassed. “Kristy, we haven’t decided —”

“Oh, sure,” Kristy said. “But we weren’t the last to hear.”

We looked at each other, wondering what the big announcement was and I was surprised this was how tense the meeting was. I knew that if Kristy and I got to know each other properly, we would all come up with brilliant ideas for solving major problems, which would be great!

“What the hell are you waiting for?” Mallory cried.

“My idea would be to have a club with a record book where parents could find out who is available to take on a case-by-case thing,” Kristy announced. “They could be as sure as a baby stepsister that we have a baby-sitter.”

“Oh, Kristy, you're right,” I said. “I mean, as soon as we have that, I guess it makes sense.”

“Great!” Mary Anne exclaimed. A few minutes later, she and Claudia were talking. “The record book would be very useful,” Claudia said.

“Very useful,” Kristy replied.

“But “the book would be perfect if there are a bunch of available baby-sitters and parents can call me at home and say …,”

“The record book would be perfect for you,” Mallory added with a smile. A lot of people use that expression. Well, it’s true.”

“Great idea,” Stacey commented.

“Great!” “Oh! I’m already thinking about it,” Stacey began. “This is going to be the easiest job I know my family has ever had, and I’ve got all the baby pictures I could get my hands on right away.”

“I do, Jamie.” Mary Anne shook her head. “But I don’t know how.”

“I do, Mary Anne.” Mal was teasing.

“Okay, let’s see,” Stacey said. “I’m just a student and I’m just a sitter. Just call me at home anytime and I’ll check it out.” (That was the way Mary Anne and Kristy were running things.)

It didn’t take much to convince us all to take the job and get married. We did get a huge promotion, though. Claudia, after reading about our wedding, invited Kristy, me, Stacey, and I to join her. Stacey joined us, too. We love Stacey and the way she dresses, the way she lives, the way she eats, everything. That’s how Stacey came onto our club. She just had to make it happen.

At that point, I decided that as vice-president of the club, Claudia could do her job. But she did a really brilliant job. She announced that our club would hold meetings after every meeting in our room. That was an incredible idea; I could
