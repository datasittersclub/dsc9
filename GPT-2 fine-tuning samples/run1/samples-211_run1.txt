======== SAMPLE 1 ========

I've heard from many of you, friends. I hear from people I admire now that I share many of them, people I admire back. I have friends all over the world, too. Some of them are my friends. I've even seen contacts between several contacts in my life — contacts with family and friends. But I have to keep up appearances at a meeting even if these contacts aren't my.

And I keep worrying that nobody ever bothers me about my looks.

Mary Anne has seven brothers and sisters. Their parents and siblings are not that interested in looking after Mary Anne and Dad. I'll give them two, although a triplet is good, because they will not be able to care for kids of their own age. If they're lucky, they may even get a kitten. They look terrific, though, as Mary Anne has discovered.

I have the longest hair in the world. I have three kids, Nannie and Andrew, Jr., who are identical triplets. We also have eight-year-old Jessica Ramsey. She moved here with her mother. (She and her father moved to Stoneybrook.) As for my hair, it's pretty simple, and I wear the same kind of clothes, if you will. As for hair, there's plenty of it.

I have diabetes. That's a very serious disease, and it can keep you sick or turn you into a diabetic. My doctor told me it was fine.

Mal has brown eyes, and an almond-shaped nose. She's African-American, with long, curly black hair. She's a student at Stoneybrook Middle School and works part-time there.

We use the same phone. Mal's a regular passenger and gets all the phone calls from the clientele.

The phone is Mal's and Claudia's. (They also use her old phone number, but the clients call it her new one.)

Kristy, Claudia's best friend, is also best friend. She's the one who actually knows me. It's just that she keeps the phone switched off, which means she can't come up with anything but us jokes. It's a relief to have another friend in trouble.

Kristy's best friend is Mary Anne. When she was still a baby, there was a boyfriend in the BSC. His name is Logan Bruno. Kristy and her twin sister, Margo, who is a true genius, adore him. But Mary Anne and her younger brother, Jeff, have trouble with their families and divorce.

At least they don't have a brother and sister, Jeff and Vanessa (Mary Anne and I are not). In fact, the Mary Anne and I of the BSC are in the midst of the greatest romance in all the BSC books. In it, Mary Anne comes up with up-to-the-second, best-in-class ideas when something really special strikes. This happens because of the way the BSC keeps track of our schedules. We all use the BSC and the client and the teachers and the phone. We have a huge responsibility to report on every baby-sitting job we can handle, except in case of emergency. This is how we handle sick or injured kids, the ones who are in the hospital for a week or more, the ones who are in the orphanage, the ones who need to be treated at other orphanages. We also report when we need more baby-sitters, for example at a certain date, or when an unexpected need arises.

We have a lot of clients, and all us clients adore all kinds of things. I don't have any other pets besides pets. I'm just as happy to have a kitten as a cat. I love the cat and I have all sorts of great pet projects. The best thing about my kitten is that it's very happy. The kitten is also very quiet — as if the other pets could be noisy, but couldn’t hear you. But it’s a good kitten, and everyone will like it.

When you can get a kitten and a kitten-and-a-fiddle-sunday blanket, you know you’re going to be on a hot, sunny summer summer day to start your workday. You know, that would be great! You have some fun when you feel down and out, and when it gets pretty hot and sunny you can be a little more creative.

It also doesn’t hurt that you’re in the right job — I have great contacts in Stoneybrook and in Stacey's neighborhood. The kids here love me. And I have a whole bunch of excellent friends and close associates.

There’s one more thing about Kristy. That’s the truth. She and her husband are really mean. They can’t even help it. They make a good mess, though.

Maybe I
