 size, and she can do it! Kristy, as I said, has a terrific sense of style and she definitely has her own ways of dressing — jeans, turtleneck shirts, and sneakers that she keeps carefully cropped. She doesn't like to go overboard.

Kristy's mother works as an editor for the magazine she works for. Kristy can be a lot of fun for it. She has her eye on being a great editor and she's good about it. She's not sure how to apply herself to the job. She's great at languages, too, spoken and written by other kids.

Speaking of brains, I should mention that Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike are our two junior officers. They're both eleven years old, both talented and lovable, and good at anything they care about horses.

Jessi and Mal are best friends and their names are Vanessa and Mallory. They don't go to SMS or Laine. They do though, though. They're junior officers because they're younger than the rest of us. Jessi and Mal are junior officers because they're eleven, which is the same age as most of the rest of us in the BSC. There are two other junior officers in the club: Mal is very involved in independent living and lives only in her parent's basement. She's a natural baby-sitter, too. She's wonderful with kids and the oldest of all, since she's got seven younger siblings!

I know Mal's a little jealous of Mal. She's the oldest in two kids, Jessica and Mallory, and she doesn't consider her a rival since she's already great with her age — which is seven. Jessi says her mother is like a mother who gives Mal a hard time.

Mal and I have a lot in common. We were BSC members, especially Mary Anne. Mal's ambition was to be an author-illustrator of children's books. As you can see, her passion is writing and drawing. Mal's favorite pastimes are sports (she's a softball player) and reading horse books. And when it comes to writing, she loves to tell the stories — tell funny ones — of other kids — and she plans to write about her own stories someday.

I know Jessi and Mal like to talk and to write, too. That's the only good news for Stacey McGill — she has diabetes. That means her body can't process sugar. She has to be very, very careful about what she eats, and it's very, very difficult for her to control her diabetes. You see, her body doesn't produce the required amount of TGs naturally. If she ate nothing and kept an under-the-counter (OTC) cocktail charge of an even bigger fat cigar in her hand, she could become very sick. I think it's partly due to her diabetes, but as I've said, the symptoms are pretty mild.

It's funny. Jessi, who is African American, is the club's first black member, and she has the longest, wild, blonde hair. It's as long as Mal's, and she's also fidgety and clumsy. It makes her look like a child who'd never hurt a finger.

Although there are two junior members of the BSC, they're not allowed to sit at night unless they're sitting for their own brothers and sisters, so they take a lot of afternoon jobs. Jessi's the only BSC member with a steady boyfriend. His name's Logan Bruno, and he's from Kentucky.

Jessi's life changed a lot after her dad fell behind and she was forced to move back in with her mother and father. Things were tough for her and her family there, but by the time she found a steady boyfriend, she was hooked. It was a rough time for her, but finally she had a good girlfriend. The one with whom she wasn't so worried. Shannon Kilbourne had moved back from the city with her after her mother's divorce. Before David Michael hung up the phone, Shannon had come to live with us. It was only a matter of time before Shannon met the woman she became attached to, and became a full-time member of the club. Jessi, on the other hand, moved back to Stoneybrook (along with Logan and Jessica), and we reintroduced her to the community.

Anyway, Shannon's coming back to Stoneybrook not long, and while we wait she was thrilled to be reunite with Jessi. They fell in love again and got married, and the Thomases moved into Stacey's old house!

That's it! Mary Anne Spier’s most amazing idea so far, that’s the whole story. I don’t know what she told Mary Anne. Maybe she tried to tell her and she gave a big sigh. Then she told her story to her best friend, Mary Anne Sp
