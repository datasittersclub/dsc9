 with the kids. He just wants to be a star football player. (I think Stoneybrook always comes first).

He's also an excellent sports counselor, and one of the reasons he's such a good student-athlete — it's one of those things in life where you just have to know your thoughts — but the reason I have to be the center of attention is because I know how to draw attention.

It's one of those things you do when you're in charge of something else. You can ask someone to sit for you but say, in a teasing manner, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

You can be a super human center of attention. That's one reason we're so successful. We've made it to several other meetings and also to our vice-presidential meeting.

The meeting was adjourned when Mary Anne said, “Let me tell you how I met Stacey.”

“Who?” I asked, glancing at Stacey and saying, “Kristy. Kristy Schafer, the treasurer.”

“Kristy?” Mary Anne replied. “Don’t be ridiculous. I just met her. I know she’s great.”

Before Mary Anne could say anything, Stacey spoke again. “What did you say, Jessi?”

“Well, what about this week?” I teased.

“Oh, I said I’m going to be a prima-basse.”

We started discussing a little further. Stacey's mother died in a car accident almost ten years ago this week, when Stacey was just starting out.

“How did you know?” Kristy asked.

“It was just a coincidence,” said Mary Anne.

“Well, I didn’t,” said Stacey again. “I didn’t know, either.”

“Well, you know,” Mary Anne finally admitted, “I just wanted to do the Kwanzaa dance for someone else,” she concluded.

“Okay,” Kristy insisted.

“Okay,” I said. We talked for a few more minutes until the phone rang again.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club,” the BSC reported.

“Who is it, Mary Anne?”

“She’s coming.”

“Oh, hi, Mrs. Kwanzaa.”

“Oh, hi, Mrs. Kwanzaa.” Kristy opened the record book and opened up the record book. There, she checked out each of us members’ names and addresses.

“Okay, thanks,” Mary Anne said.

“Mrs. Kwanzaa, you’ve a few extra business, you know?” Kristy prompted.

Kristy, Abby, and I talked about Claudia's art class we had organized for her. (Claudia doesn’t like to wear earrings and goes to private school dances.)

It was almost time for my class, but a gigantic red phone cut the suspense. After the announcement that Claudia was going to be taking our dance class, I dialed Stacey. The next thing I knew, just as Kristy was about to explain that Claudia had a new project, we were all busy thinking about how to make and distribute candy.

Jessi came in first, and it looked like all a game to talk to her. She’d been working on it with Stacey, and she had come up with all kinds of brilliant ideas.

“Just give us the candy,” Kristy said.

There’d been one person (that was Kristy, of course) who could help her with the drawing of everything that had gone in her closet. And another. And two …

“And one!”

“And two!”

Suddenly, I was in the center of my thoughts …

“I’m in the center of the picture!”

“It will take all of this candy!” Stacey added, and I couldn’t help feeling embarrassed that I hadn’t actually given Stacey a chance to talk. (She doesn’t usually do that.)

We were all thinking about the picture and even about the candy — the way they’d decorated it. Would I have gotten a bead on Stacey’s designs if she had told us? What if she had told us what she liked about our school snack?
