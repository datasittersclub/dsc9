 me to our seventh meeting and he said, “Well, we’re working on this. Let’s look at this one first.”

I turned to Claudia and said, “If you don’t mind, it’s late today. We have three business days left, and I’s going to call you right back.” We waited, but she said, “I’m calling my father and father’s firm. It’s Friday afternoon, and I’m not even in town.” She picked up her phone and dialed. “Claudia, your company is calling Thursday afternoon from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut?”

I shook my head — I was still an instant on the hook for our afternoon call — but she said, “Right.”

Claudia looked up from her digital clock. “Monday,” she pointed out.

“Monday,” Claudia explained. “I’m calling my mother. She’s calling from her farmhouse. She’s not there yet, but I’ll check it out Thursday morning, and see what we can do.”

“What if your mother could be a part of the group, too?” I asked.

She shrugged. “You know, the BSC. No offense, but I thought the idea was one of the best justifications of the organization.”

I’m an associate member so I’d probably enjoy my time with Claudia. But I didn’t want to make any friends.

“It’s your last Saturday, you know?” Jessi asked.

“Well,” I said. “I don’t feel bad if I’m being late. I’m just having a weekend, anyway. I can check in tomorrow and take it over again. No way can I help you with the homework or if you have a stroke.”

“You are too harsh, Jessi.” Sunny began to leave a note on the clock. “I’m not being harsh. I just … I mean, let’s see, I haven’t been helping you with homework for two days. You don’t have to worry.” Sunny had left the BSC note and gone back to her room.

Sunny was sobs and groans as she continued to leave the note and her room. I’m the head librarian at the school where she was going to be taking the afternoon meeting of the club. You have to give me a break. The record book was already full of notes and schedules for me. As I said, Sunny’s left some of her homework in the record book and has gone back to schoolwork. She doesn’t do very well in school, so she sometimes has to cancel appointments. When she’s free I can take her back to the bus or taxi. But I like to have her baby. She’s eight weeks.

I didn’t feel so bad about leaving, but I hoped we could work things out later.

As I walked back to my office, the silence on Claudia’s room was eerie.

“I’m sick, Mary Anne,” I said.

Claudia rolled her eyes at us and gave us each a kiss.

“I hate to hurt you, Mary, but I can’t help it,” I told her.

Sunny glared at her for a moment.

“Not before I’m free, then,” Jessi asked, frowning.

Sunny rolled her eyes back.

“You’re not free, I’m saying.”

Mary Anne gave a worried shriek to me. I raised an eyebrow.

I know, it’s difficult to believe, but Mary Anne is the reason I live in Claudia’s room and I love her. I’m the type who likes to talk about books and ideas.

Sunny rubbed her chin and smiled at me as she left our office. It took a little while to clear her throat, but finally, I had her in my arms. We settled in to watch Sunny drive her away. (That’s Sunny’s private car.)

I hated to look, but I decided against covering my face in the bright sun, because I didn’t want my dark eyes to look gross. Sunny makes my eyes blue, and I like her for that. We’re best friends and we’re both short with brown
