ley,” I said. “Did Kristy tell you about this? How to make it edible,” I continued,””and that’s where you see her say she’d make a recipe for a whole vegetable bouillabaisse — it was the one she talked about and it was pretty darn delicious.”

“We could use it,” said Kristy.

“Yeah?” Mary Anne asked.

“Yeah,” said Kristy. She looked thoughtful. I knew it was nice to see something that she really respects. She has a lot in common with us. For one thing, she was from California. She moved here during the Great Recession with her mother and her dad, which has meant that not only has she lived with her dad, but also with her younger brother, David Michael, who is a real millionaire. And while Kristy is outgoing, Mary Anne seems a little shy at times. She’s loud. Her mom died recently, so it’s hard to talk to her at home during the holidays. So she comes to visit occasionally. But it’s just enough to make her feel like a little girl.

“Oh, you’ve been working on an egg processing plant,” Mary Anne said, pulling out a piece of foil.

“That’s great,” said Kristy. “It’s not like you have to put on my sweater. I’m in pretty good shape. I haven’t ever looked this pretty before.”

“And you don’t want mine to look so yellow or gray or anything,” Kristy insisted. “I’m all green. It’s really pretty.”

“Well, that’s true. I’m really looking great, and I am so excited to be working with Mary Anne. It should be exciting to see how she will dress.<|endoftext|>
“You know how I said something about having your fingerprints on your clothes?” Claudia asked.

I couldn’t take my breath away. I held my breath and waited. I couldn’t help it, though. I tried to calm myself down, even trying to think up the other reasons why I’d like Claudia better than the rest of us.

“I like Claudia. I like what she’s done.”

“Well, she’s not as sophisticated as I think she is,” I said.

“Maybe I’d like it more. I’m not too interested in clothes at your school uniform day, though, either. They’re really boring. And I think it’s cool that someone like Claudia is so sophisticated. But I think I like it more of how Claudia doesn’t look so much like me. I don’t think she ever has glasses or braces, let alone a real earlobe, but she does look different from I’m in a million ways.”

Jessi McGill and Mallory Pike made up a team. Jessi is a two-year-old Vietnamese girl. She dresses in her own cute way. When she grows up, she runs around on the back of her head like a catfish.

Jessi is a natural athlete. She has a strong, fast build. So athletic, in fact, that even during a hard day like today, I’d have to pull myself together to sprint to the finish line. Her athletic abilities do lend herself, though, as she often does her thing with a smile. And I’m glad I did. I liked Jessi, really. She grew up in California, and she’s my new best friend here in Louisville, Kentucky.

Anyway, when I first met Jessi, she was a little kid I'd never met. Jessi isn’t an average baby-sitter. Her mother died in a car accident when Jessi was nine, and her father raised her by himself as much as he could, and he did things that made Jessi feel that she’d be a little taller. Now, Jessi is seven feet tall and wearing glasses and leggings, with a big, brown beard and a long, thick, curly, silky blonde cap. But just as she’s grown more sophisticated — and even more sensitive — Jessi’s parents are getting better at regulating her weight. (The glasses Jessi carries now are a little heavier, but I prefer them, so maybe I better make them the case.) Jessi is black with black hair, like me, and wears glasses and braces and braces, as well. She doesn
