s to their rooms, then wait while a group of eight or nine officers arrive to check on the baby. Then they meet to distribute the baby among the seven sitting officers, so that each baby feels responsible for being picked out.

The BSC also maintains a phone list that the members use to reach our clients and other associate members. To keep up-to-date with our club calendar, we also have a client calendar (which includes official club information in addition to the BSC record book) and an SMS list.

By now you probably know Mary Anne well. She lives near you on the left side of Queen Anne — in the center of the home, just across from the front window. She's the club president and she has two younger brothers, Sam and Charlie, and two sisters, Tiffany and Becca.

But she's a little weird about Mary Anne, who doesn’t let a mother or a baby-sitter have too much to do. For example, the last time I saw Mary Anne was just after she moved to Stoneybrook. She moved back to California to care for her brother, her mom, her younger sister Becca, her little brother Squirt (from Vietnam), and Becca’s younger brother, David Michael. (David Michael is just as shy.) Mary Anne had to make do with her two oldest brothers, David Michael (seven) and Sam (four), and, well, not quite enough of a family.

But Mary Anne is still an active member of the BSC. She visits so many times a week that we even have one of her sitters. The club records Mary Anne’s name so that you know when she’s available. We use her room whenever we’re at our meetings, since she doesn’t have a phone. (She lives on Jill from five years ago.)

Mary Anne’s family is not quite as different to us as one might think. She's more like us. You’d think her family would be as organized and supportive as her older sister's family, but for the simple reason that both Mary Anne’s family and hers are much smaller. Mary Anne, on the other hand, has this awesome personality, and unlike some of the other girls, she lives with her parents. It can’t be easy getting through tough times, but Mary Anne keeps it together just fine.

The best thing about Mary Anne is that she’s such a good student. She doesn’t make too many mistakes. She writes and draws her own stories. And, of course, she cries during special circumstances.

So who’s the best baby-sitter at the BSC? None of us are in the BSC yet, but we're interested in some of the other members. The other members of the BSC are Vanessa and Mallory. Vanessa is an excellent baby-sitter, an amazing ballet student, and a gorgeous blonde with long, wavy black hair.

Mallory, on the other hand, is very quiet. She and Louie are best friends, and they usually go out without a fight. She was so excited the very first meeting of the Baby-sitters Club because she’s always happy to see the new faces.

Logan Bruno is one of our members. He’s a real professional. He’s the club’s alternate officer and an associate member. The reason he’s so comfortable with being an ordinary baby-sitter is that he’s a real artist, especially when it comes to his paintings.

The reasons were obvious. Mr. Bruno is the guy most responsible for keeping the Baby-sitters Club running smoothly. He’s also the president of the club, and he makes sure all the children are fed and clothed, in no time at all. Even though he’s an awful parent, he’s kind and kind and even thoughtful and kind. And he looks out for our clients.

We’re very lucky to have him. He and Louie’s grandmother are from Vietnam, so they’ve known each other since the old days. Logan’s Vietnamese, too. He’s totally cool, and very good about dressing up. Sometimes I wonder if Logan could wear makeup if he wasn’t wearing glasses. And of course, wearing makeup is one of the things that is really hard on Logan. He’s addicted to it — and pretty much always wears it — since he’s very close to the school board.

The club meeting was held that very weekend. And the girls who were in it were very busy. Mary Anne (who has a smaller family size), Vanessa (our club’s oldest friend), and Logan were just beginning to get used to each other. I was lucky I was there because the other
