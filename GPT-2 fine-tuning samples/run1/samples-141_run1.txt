======== SAMPLE 1 ========
’s been doing really well. He always makes sure to make sure to wear clothes that match his personality. You don’t see that often, but this is one of those times. And he’s really smart, too. I mean, he just’s quiet and quiet, with a great sense of humor. But he’s very stubborn and a stubborn man.

“You don’t have to be a genius to know how to behave,” Kristy Thomas said. Although the BSC members have a lot of information to offer, like the list of rules for making pancakes every day, there’s absolutely no excuse to not make this, right?

“Yeah.”

“It’s just that there’s too much stuff in it.”

Kristy smiled at me. “What was so funny about this?” She asked. I didn’t quite know what to say.

“Well, maybe one day I’ll be able to make it myself.” Kristy said enthusiastically. “A few simple rules.”

What was so funny about this? When I was reading the rules, I had to wonder. It’s so simple, but it was really hard for me to believe that I could make it. The only problem was that the rules weren’t even on my record book. It’s like a pile of math equations that could have led me to a single solution.

Kristy was so interested in keeping the BSC's record book up-to-date that she thought it would be even more helpful if she told us all about our mistakes along the way. (Kristy and I are usually the first to admit that we have to hide certain things we know we’ll never do right.)

“Well, there’s one thing I don’t know about,” Kristy said. “My mom died when I was a baby.”

“That’s why my best friend lives to talk my best friend.” Kristy paused and thought for a moment, looking at her computer, where her mom was writing a new book every week. My best friend could hardly believe it. (Kristy and I are practically opposites, with big personalities and big personalities, like the BSC. But Kristy and I are opposites.)

“She used to live next door to me all her life, when all her friends were all gone, and they didn’t talk to each other.”

“You’d never believe her, or think her, would you?” Kristy asked.

“He was the one.” I said. And I’ve always hated him. He wasn’t cute, and he was awfully mean to me.

“Yeah,” she said. Her voice was so sweet that it’s hard to believe it’s so sweet. “When we were little, we couldn’t wait to be grown-ups again.” We had to wait until it was summer, right?

“The BSC is just getting better and better and better at math as the years go by.”

I sat with Claudia and Andrew and Mary Anne and my best friend, Stacey, in the lobby of Claudia’s, while they listened to Kristy fill us all in on that fateful meeting. Then it hit me. Kristy said she has some business in Stoneybrook and, when everybody else told her that, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

“Kristy, I’m going to need you to give me a call,” Kristy told us at the beginning. “You’d better find me an associate sitter for a few minutes, then.”

“The BSC has been making this meeting about an associate.” I answered. Just as Kristy was about to give us a quick call, the phone rang.

“Kristy,” I said, “Hello,” I’d heard my sister's voice on the other end of the line.

“Hey,” I said.

“I am!” Kristy sprang out of the couch and made us sit in her usual spot. (You really should give Kristy some time to herself. She has more energy than any of us members — or associate members. Maybe she’s feeling pretty groggy.) If I’d known that’s what she would have said, I'd have laughed. She has a long, complicated story; in it, she tells stories as the BSC rules
