"They are going to fight," Kishi said. "But you know what? If I win, the Brewers wouldn’t be here."

"Good," I said. "And thanks to Louie, Boo-Boo is finally here to stay."

"Yeah, thanks a lot," Abby said. "I should really be here by that time."

Claudia and I looked at each other. We’d seen each other three or four times before. I couldn’t help feeling almost as guilty as Claudia. That’s probably because I was looking forward to seeing her. For the first time since we’d started the club, I wished I had known about the activities at my aunt’s. She and Barrett Browning, who is kind of an associate member, sit in for my mom and dad all the time. At first glance, I could tell they looked alike. They’re Japanese-American, they’re slim, and they’re older than Claudia. I’d guess they’re both in high school, but they’re in college now. Claudia and Barrett are best friends.

“Hey, Claud, are you there next week? I’ll check our schedules and call you right back.”

That was all I could think about. I hung up the phone and turned my attention to the meeting that afternoon.

Mallory and I were waiting for our parents to come over. They’re very close. They’ve been helping us study in New York.

“We’re only a week off from school, okay?” I wanted to ask. Mallory has really had to toughen up lately. She’s doing really well, and she visits the doctor more often. But anyway, if our parents can’t adjust to having a baby-sitter, then we might want to consider an adult with proper training and experience with kids, Jessi’s age, to take the job, say, tutoring a little younger sister, Dawn, in California.” (My mouth was frozen. Dawn’s not here, though. She just came back to Stoneybrook.)

“Oh, please.” I glanced at the clock. “Two-thirty-two here.”

“Thanks, dear.” By the time my mom hung up the phone, I thought, “What a relief to see you again. Oh, and I’m going to be so busy. I’ll be working with a program — not a comedy — at the local elementary school.”

That made me sweat a little. Sure enough, it was the New York City section of the American Academy of Sciences. “Yes,” I said. “Yes again.”

“We’ll have to check our schedules, though.”

“Check. I —”

“Hewwo!”

The bell rang. My mom checked the clock. “Claudia’s almost there!”

“Oh, dear,” I breathed. “Don’t remind me.”

“You better!”

“Okay,” I switched to the next one.

“We’ll make it!” yelled my mom. “Go for it.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I —”

“You’ve made it!” my dad called. “It’s three-thirty-two. Now’s a relief day.”

“You know,” I said, “it’s true.”

“True!” Dad repeated. “I know.”<|endoftext|>
We sat there, quietly meditating on the Baby-sitters Agency and how it works. I barely said anything about Michael. I would never have said anything like that in my life. That’s because I have no idea what it is. Like a detective, I’m too dazed to even try to think about it.

My parents keep this hard, old saying — “Everything you know about Michael S.K.’ — a secret. You don’t even know it until you realize it’s true. That’s because they’re very strict and that’s because they’re very shy.

My mother would never go near an infant without being tiptoed. Her wet dreams sometimes make me dizzy, and every time she does she seems
