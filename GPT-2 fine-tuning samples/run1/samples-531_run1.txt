. Mary Anne looked at Kristy and then Mary Anne. They both said the same thing: that this wasn't a good sign (Mary Anne always thinks it's because of her mother). Mary Anne even thought it was strange. When Dawn talked about this or that day, it was like she was trying to convince Kristy that Dawn's talk was nothing but a joke and that she had to stop talking.

Mary Anne didn't seem to care much about the other members, either. She seemed more interested in the junk food, the weird stuff. But we all knew what she was talking about. It wasn't just junk food, it was old-fashioned stuff. And it was pretty gross, considering Mary Anne lived across the street from Claudia.

But Mary Anne had better give a good lecture. At her request, I gave her my best imitation of Stacey (of course I'd try to convince her to stop trying to look cute!) and Kristy (who was standing next to me).

I could barely remember anything about the group except how little Mary Anne had changed, and how much she missed her mother as the BSC secretary she has to keep reminding everyone what time each week is here. I'd probably die right now, of something in particular, but I guess having a secretary makes it easier on the club.

Mary Anne is usually shy, quiet, and blunt. Like Kristy, she's quiet and sensitive and incredibly creative. (She's one of the smartest people I know. She's always thinking up jokes and schemes.)

But we meet in her room because she's the only one of us with our own phone line. She's the one with the lines to our clients and stores, she's the one making call after call to find a sitter, and so on.

Our secretary is Kristy Thomas. (I'm the one with the phone so it's practically her.) Kristy's life isn't easy on people like me. Her life is tough. First of all, she has diabetes. It's a disease that prevents her body from processing sugar correctly (sugar can't be excreted directly into the blood, which is why she has to be very careful about hiding it). After having diabetes she has to watch her diet, give herself daily injections (eww), and have every hormone in her body balanced out so that she always feels full. And that's not a feeling that anyone with diabetes can be — just a diabetic.

Kristy's family has diabetes and her couldn't properly control it. They also have severe asthma, which can make it a life-and-saver. And they're very, very careful about what they eat, too.

Now, Kristy's never been caught cheating. In fact, she was super-polite — a decent person who respects her own feelings, a nice person who respects her own clothes. Even my mom lets her dress in her underwear. See, Kristy has a lot of problems. She's had to struggle with some subjects, but the major point of her problems is that she has diabetes. That means she has to be very careful about what she eats and — very seriously — give herself daily injections of something called insulin. But that's it. And when she gets used to her new system, she tends to do better in school.

"Do you know any special secrets from Mrs. Willards?" asked Stacey.

"Yeah," replied Kristy, as usual.

Stacey moved in that house with her (two kids) and her mom from a nice house on Bradford Court across the street from Claudia. Stacey has brown hair, freckles, and brown eyes. (Her hair is still gray.) Like Claudia, she has two younger sisters (Becca and Squirt). I like her a lot and I've known her the longest. Squirt is a boy, but that changed this year. Not that the Willards have changed, but neither has Claudia. They were just the two of us.

Claudia is seven, Claudia is four. She's the exotic dancer Claudia dreamed up. Every Tuesday for two and a half weeks, she takes a ballet class, dances a few feet from us, and then goes back to ballet. As the class gets easier and easier she comes back to her hometown. Claudia is an artistic genius, but Claudia is one of those creative people who stay true to her artistic nature. She makes everything work, and she does it well.

Claudia has long black hair (almost always blonde now) and blonde, cocoa-colored hair (almost always reddish-brown now). She dresses in jeans, a turtleneck, and sneakers, sometimes a baseball cap with a picture of a collie on it. At times she puts her head in the sand and does the Impossible Number (I'll explain why), going into detail about the person who helped her find the steady boyfriend. She is, to
