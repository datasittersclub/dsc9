 to come and study here.

“I’ve told you,” she said, very softly. “Now let’s take a day.”

I had to laugh. “What?” I cried again. “Oh, very sincerely. I really do think the girls should be allowed to have more than one lunch.”

“All girls?” asked Stacey.

“Yes,” Kristy replied.

“Great,” said Mary Anne after listening. We decided to hold it up as a challenge.

We started out with ten sitting girls plus one each boy and one girl. In between lunch, we picked up our bingo cards and passed the job to Kristy. She paid for the snacks, and we played. Then we started making sandwiches. We were having a great time, but when the bell rang, we started laughing.

“Come on, baby,” Kristy said, putting her hands on her hips. Then she took two deep breaths and asked, “Do you want to … …?' She started moving her legs. “I just … just wanted to show you ….”

Anna looked up with a surprised expression. “How does it feel to have her on your toes?”

“It feels great,” Mary Anne volunteered. “I bet you feel her toes when you touch them.”

“It’s great,” said Dawn. “I wish the girls would have a real quiz.”

“I wish I had that to say about our friendships,” said Claudia with a smile.

“Well, that’s what I want to hear,” said Mary Anne. “It’s only a first-grade class, you know. My best friend.”<|endoftext|>
"Who knew there would be a ghost meeting?" Claudia said. "The ones who thought it was real."
Ick. No such luck.
Kristy Thomas is the president of the BSC. She came up with the idea for the BSC a few years ago, when her mom invited her and her brother, Sam, to join. She asked them about Claud's old high school sweetheart — tutoring program. After a lot of looking, they decided to do something about it, which they did. Soon the Thomas family was one big family. Mrs. Thomas met up with her son and went through what she calls the holy grail of BSC planning. That is, the meetings of high-school kids, because she's the one with the ideas. I don't know if Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Thomas can believe their luck. They're sitting idly as two girls meet for the second time. Mrs. Thomas has to make up her mind about how to handle the Thomas kids, and she has to decide whether or not to try something the Krushers have announced.
It was a tough decision, I should say, but the Thomases finally settled on a project they called Kristy's Plan. Kristy put all her energy into it. Then a third of the way through seventh grade she went to my math class and asked to take a class with a group of middle-school kids, and she said she would make a study for our project. That was when we were in the seventh grade. I'd seen Kristy's face on picture after picture lately, and I knew she was excited! She was very practical and easygoing. She wasn't afraid of saying the stupid things or dragging the case — she just used her college position. Kristy is an all-around good student, and she just used her good standing to do what she thought was right for the kids at hand. (Her position doesn't have to be perfect, but she certainly doesn't tolerate being bossy.)
We all came up with a lot of good ideas, which Kristy had to plan for our club. Then she talked to her best friend, Mary Anne Spier. They decided to meet on weeknights from four to five to design club materials and to test them out. This was a real disaster. We had to find new materials and processes and stuff, and keep everyone organized. We were on time from seven to eight. We were in trouble from the minute our clients showed up to fill out our sitting jobs. The idea worked perfectly, and the Thomas-Spier Club had an even larger following. We now keep a record of the jobs in our club notebook, in which we write up our sitting experiences. We also keep a club record book with all our appointments, so we don't have to keep track of every job once it comes into the office. (We'd better stick to holding them with us during the day or night.) A club notebook is something I
