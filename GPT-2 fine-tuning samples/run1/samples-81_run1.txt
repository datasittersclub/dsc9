that day, the girl was sitting in that small, shiny, pink, black-and-white ball cap that looked totally natural. I hadn't seen that in person, but I had seen the other one, and it was beautiful.

And so we went on with our daily routine. One afternoon on Jan. 17, we were having lunch at the Baby-sitters Club. I checked in my notes, and I wrote down three details. First, Mrs. Thomas was telling me if anyone had ever seen them, she'd make a baby-sitting announcement. Second, she was going to call us, and my brother-in-law, Watson Brewer, would call back right away. And lastly, the Baby-sitters Club president, Sharon Ramsey — Sharon’s best friend and the one who always calls when we have a baby-sitting call, because she’s always there for our calls.

All of a sudden, in all those places, Mr. Thomas could be reached. He had a phone number, and he had a mailing address. I don’t recall if he was a regular phone user, since he has three kids, but Mr. Thomas was just getting started. One of them is a baby, and there are a million more kids in the world than Mr. Thomas’s baby-sitting job.

"Hey, Watson — I want you to call Mrs. Thomas about that?" I said, sounding really nervous.

Shannon Bruno was sitting in the booth of the Baby-sitters Club headquarters. “I can’t be any other way.” she said, holding up her hand.

"She’s right, I believe," Watson said.

"Did I miss anything?" I asked.

She sighed. “I just got my job back.” She looked at her watch, then looked at me. “It doesn’t count for anything, you and Watson.”

"We have some other jobs. Let’s talk about my job," said Sharon. “How do I know that?"

We hung up on Watson. He said, “We are not doing any baby-sitting. We’re doing business with Claudia. She does the housework, she makes the phone calls, and Claudia is always available. She’s already calling clients and helping out at our club meetings. She’s always available. Anyway, if you know anything, call me at “seven or eight in the afternoon,” she said. “Just tell me if you can." “I am sure that Mrs. Thomas and her clients’ will be busy. We’re getting plenty of calls this afternoon. I haven’t seen you in a while, though." I looked at Shannon and Claudia, as if I were some genius. The other job I didn’t know about was Claudia’s mother.

"I know," I said. “I don’t understand. Do you?"

Claudia looked away from me. Her eyes looked awful.

"What do you mean?" Shannon asked me.

"If I was to be called the Baby-sitters Club president I’d think about calling the baby-sitters club president. I mean. I think, you know, you know that when we have our first meeting (which is a Thursday afternoon) the BSC is sitting the last of our members. And we’re going to go to a baby-sitting dinner, too. I’ve talked too much already."

"I think so," I said.

"It doesn’t seem like a big deal, anyway," Shannon said. “But then how could I be a member if we had a meeting Wednesday afternoon after lunch to hold baby-sitting dinner? I mean, our business with Claudia, as I said. And what if my boss called me the Baby-sitters Club president? No wonder I could never call my boss. I think I should be a member."

"I’m not worried about calling me the Baby-Sitters Club president, Charlie," Shannon said, laughing. "It’s a nice job. I’m not going to make too much noise."

“I want to use the Baby-sitters Club lunch to fill up my mind.”

No. Not really, which was good. I was thinking about it, and I just could not leave it here. I thought about how if I had to use a job, or one of my client’s (I’m the only one), I’d be thrown out.

All I know now is that I would have been dead, anyway.
