 him to do something for Claudia, maybe she'd think twice about leaving the club. At the very least, she'd look like a model and probably miss the associate memberships she would have with Stoneybrook Middle School. That would be okay. I suppose I can guess wrong.

It was Monday on Friday; everyone else was in business school. Kristy and Mary Anne were in the director's chair, while Kristy and Stacey were sitting in Claudia's digital clock. Claudia had called off the meeting, and Dawn and her three brothers â€” her other one, Charlie, who's an executive editor for a big publishing company in California, and Sam, who plays sports (I guess that makes sense), and is basically a sports fiend except for the fact that he's a super-athlete. That means a lot to them, and no wonder they grumble whenever they hear about the Arnold/Brewster gym and stuff.

Claudia doesn't seem to mind being in her digital clock more than Mary Anne does. (I think it makes her seem extra busy.) That day, for example, she was sitting in Mary Anne's director's chair while she wrote out a note (we call it a job during the meeting) reading, "I can't do the job, but...."

Dawn, by the way, will probably be absent from the meeting. She's Mary Anne's alternate officer because she's also Dawn's other alternate officer. (Mary Anne used to be Mary Anne's alternate officer, but she quit the club for a while. She wanted to rejoin now that she and her father are really close.) Dawn has a long, long-distance relationship with her father. She had to convince him to get her father back, since Dawn hates California. We all agreed that Dawn's life has gotten really ugly recently, with her father now living in California and her mother and brother, now her father, living in California. But we all understand that it was only a situation where Mr. and Mrs. Kishi were close, and that's all.

Mary Anne gets two important looks from Claudia: black and white. Here they are in the club photo album.

Dawn has a slightly bigger look. It's almost as if she grew up on the streets of Stoneybrook. She's in sixth grade, and she goes to private school. She's pretty but she's quiet, which means she never complains much when we're having tough times in a family.

At the moment, there isn't much to do in the city except shop and sleep. There's nothing to do but drive straight home to my dad's and live off the Krushers for awhile. His house is bigger than mine. Mary Anne has to look like a dweeb, which is fine by Dawn, but she has to look awfully ... over-aged. At least she looks like a forty-nine on paper. Mary Anne has also to look like a little kid, which means she's got a lot of hair to do with that style. She's also had to learn to dress more maturely, which, as far as I know, hasn't made her much of a girl. Dawn has had a blast though, with her energy, her sense of humor, and her boyfriend Pete Thomas, who's also a dweeb.

Dawn and Mary Anne are similar age groups. They're both thirteen and in eighth grade, but when they're not together, they both go to Stoneybrook Middle School. (They were both in eighth grade when Stacey McGill, Mary Anne's friend, went to high school.) As I mentioned, the Kishis are our alternate officer, which means she takes over the duties of anyone who can't make it to a meeting, unless there's a special event.

The president of the class that became Mary Anne and Claudia were the Ramseys is Dawn Schafer, who is my best friend, and Mary Anne's best friend. Dawn has dark hair, glasses, and braces, but she's not kind to people. She's really sensitive and can't help saying grumbly things but also loving them even though she knows she should be meaner than they are.

For instance, when I was younger, Dawn was convinced that boys could be models, that boys were cute, and that there was nothing wrong with boys. But as I've grown older and more accepting, Dawn has convinced herself that boys are just as important as girls, and maybe even more important than boys. She used to make Dawn feel even more small-minded, but now she's much more firm. Now she's glad of that. She looks younger than she is, and her brown hair and glasses are the clear kind of shade that could make anyone jealous.

Dawn moved to Stoneybrook from Connecticut with her mother and sister a year ago, after her father left the family. (Mr. Spier doesn't live here anymore, but my
