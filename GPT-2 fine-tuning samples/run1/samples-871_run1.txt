======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the best thing that ever happened to me when we moved here. You know, I was dating Claudia—at first only for a little while. But then we became friends and he relaxed, and we fell in love while we were in Manhattan. Heavier than I am, he thought, but cute. And still romantic.

So, while I was in Manhattan, Dawn and Kristy (who was standing in the doorway behind me) talked for a long time. Then they got married and we became stepsisters.

Then Stacey arrived, with the baby, and all the neighbors, and the phone call that had opened the door to our house. She made an appointment with Mrs. Barrett, who is really her boyfriend and has been calling her constantly since the beginning.

We got over the dislike for Karen and moved to her. (Boy, have I been spoiled.)

Stacey collects the baby and takes care of some of the adults while he and I are at work or school. Then she goes to another California town with her dad and Sharon, who is her stepsister and best friend.

Here are some other things about Stacey, all the people she has to be with ...

She's not shy about saying her names and ages. She's not tall, and she doesn't wear glasses — although they don't look quite right on her, because she has braces (they are the clear kind). Stacey doesn't dream up projects, she writes, and she’s an amazing dancer. She also has SBS (short for School Class Bition), a really big handwriting — I did not get it. Stacey is a knockout. We always look our best when we meet, and she has proved that time flies. She comes from a gigantic, complicated family (she has seven brothers and sisters). She has seven younger brothers and sisters!

When Stacey moved to Stoneybrook with her dad and younger brother, Dawn, she also moved into the family of her idol, my best friend and next-door neighbor, Jeff! Stacey and the other BSC members were very, very careful about what they wore, and very careful who we took to baby-sitting jobs. (Some of them really outgrown their dad's team, which was coached by Shannon Kilbourne, a terrific, sweet girl). But that Friday, the BSC was on its way to a big New York City meeting. And guess who was there to see us? Jeff and Carol Newton, the new members of the BSC.

Which is why I am going to try to tell you a little bit more about the BSC a little more thoroughly — that is, until we meet again at Stamford Mall.

How did we get so together? Well, we use cookies and other advertising technologies. We also use our phone and other personal devices, which sometimes get jammed up our phones. Like our Kid-Kit, which is a box stuffed with toys and games that we bring on jobs with us. (Kid-Kits are another one of Kristy’s great ideas.) I decided that we could bring our Kid-Kits to life in a store because we all love the Kid-Kits. And our newest BSC book, if I remember right, was going to have to come on the back cover — and it had to be a title that would capture our new audience.

Who is your favorite person? Kristy? Mary Anne? Dawn?

Mall was so crowded it seemed like a day. Stacey and Claudia showed up, and Dawn followed suit.

After the meeting was over, Claudia called the meeting to order. As we walked back to our seats, I felt like champing at the bit to celebrate.

Kristy put her hand over the receiver. "What is so special about our book?" she asked. "You better bring it to BSC meetings as an adele book. I noticed that ad in the back of the book when we were having a brainstorming session."

"What the adele is?" Kristy began looking through the book. The title referred to the extra-curricular term in the book, which referred to the fact that some of the other girls didn’t approve of the adele’s use of a toy-girl name.

"What?" I asked her.

Mary Anne started searching under the bed, where she found a book that she and her friends had been brainstorming about. "I am looking at you, Dawn," she said, giving Mary Anne a kiss. While she and Stacey were making up, another book was waiting for her. This one was more interesting to me — a series of paintings, not a single book. These are the kinds of things that make anyone who pays attention turn around.

"Wait!" I said. I remembered that Stacey had mentioned that. Then I remembered that I remembered about a third of the way
