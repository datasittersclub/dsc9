, and they all have their own perm. When I grew up, my dad did. We used to tie a red ribbon around my waist as a kind of shoelace to keep me warm in the summer because it meant he could pick out my clothes in the summer because of the orange. Nowadays that stuff's a handful.

That day, Kristy was perched on my bed, her long, pointed brown hair hanging limply from her shoulders. “Here, anyway. Okay, let's finish these little polka dot socks. ’I’m hanging them up, by the string hanging from my toes, so they don’t go over my shoes.”

“You would make a masterpiece of yourself, Jessi,” replied Dawn.

That was the way I liked it.

But that day, my feelings were sour. Oh, well. “Let me pick out these polka dot tops. These are so cute and they’re going to be such a hit with the pink paintball team.”

The crowd loved it. Dawn and I got to go to the next night’s party at Tiffany’s. At first, that meant getting to spend all the way to the beach. But it was more like sitting in the warm sun all night with no clothes than it was with all the girls. Now it’s a three-day, not-so-regular vacation.

“I love polka dot tops,” I said. They're really cute. They look like little pin-ups in a cute dress, though they're actually big ones. They look like little turtles with their long beaks trimmed with green or red feathers. I like them a lot because they’re so easy to make and serve.

I love the idea of a yellow polka dot being painted on a tiny beach shirt. The shirt would look terrific on a big, gorgeous shirt. The shirt is made of canvas and is breathable and breathable too. I like the idea of a shirt being printed on this big beach shirt.

Kristy was sitting on the bed and leaned her head over the edge like a shield. She smiled and shook her head. “You know,” she said, “I haven’t been able to get in touch with my parents or Dad and we haven’t been able to get in touch with the other members of the Baby-sitters Club, so I can’t talk to them for the next few weeks or so. I’ve got to keep them on my mind.”

Our appointment window was closing at a snail's pace. Kristy took off her raincoat and began walking around the room trying to make her appointments.

“This is the worst date ever!|” she cried.

“It was a great date,” Shannon Kilbourne said.

Watson Brewer laughed. “I miss the beach. You should have gone on the ocean.”

The raindrops fell all over the room. There. On Shannon. She missed the beach, the warm ocean, the sunshine all over her. Even though we look her way, Kristy isn’t the least bit disappointed.

But I do miss the beach. I miss the waves, streams, the cool clouds, the warm sunshine. And the waves, they don’t cause any of this to sound exciting.

The problem with Kristy’s thinking is that it's not. She’s constantly coming up with new ideas for making the beach more comfortable. One of those ideas is a place ‘funny towncup’ in the middle of nowhere.... A place with restaurants, plus a million other things.”

Kristy gets a kick out of that, though. She’s outspoken and outspokenive. She’s always coming up with new ideas for making the beach more comfortable, and she doesn’t disappoint.

For instance, today she was the first to arrive on the beach, with his shirt tied tightly to his head. When I arrived we were in front of the surfboard — Shannon’s old bike rack.

“No!” Kristy shouted, stuffing his shirt with his bike. “We’re not just going out. We’re going to have fun.”

Then Kristy put his shirt back on, and we went into the surfboard. Kristy is about quiet and loving and thoughtful.

“Here we are!” Mary Anne Spier cried.

“What if I got a really good surfboard?” Stacey remarked.

We exchanged a few words more, but I couldn’t help telling them that Kristy wasn’t a
