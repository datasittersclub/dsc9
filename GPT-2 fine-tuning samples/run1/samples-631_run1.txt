 always read, and my parents say no more than once a week. I guess that keeps me supplied with sugar.

Meanwhile, Mom and Watson were working on this new project with Maggie, which was going to involve a lot of baby-sitting. Working on the project involved Maggie finding a sitter who was in New York twice a week and calling people to come sit for us at other times. I don't know if you have ever seen Maggie do this. Maggie absolutely demolishes anyone who makes a half hour call. She has to go, make that one phone call and hang up.

Our project was to collect, store, and recycle the baby-sitting materials we each had lying around the house. We planned on doing this every week, and every little weekend, as a way of helping out with the project.

We put the materials away, hoping that nobody would find them hiding places to stash them, since someone had stuffed little girls first. Well, no one found them until we moved to Watson's mansion. It was a sad day for the Baby-sitters Club, but I think we still have plenty of sitting jobs at the mansion. And, in my closet!

We also carefully removed the tops of our hats and belts, and also the underarms of our shirts, which we sometimes forget were our favorite shirts. Our other favorite activity is getting our ears pierced, which is always a pain because our girls also have pierced ears. I used to ask Dad, who is a really nice guy, if he could help, but he has to be totally patient. Sometimes I think I'd have to kick myself.

Still holding my breath as we walked back to the house, I said good-bye to Karen.

"Well? Are you okay? Mom told me to stay here and—" I didn't say anything, but I did turn around to look at Maggie.

Just then, the front door opened. As I always do when I come into the house, the front door is always the front door. In my daydream, I'd come straight out and said hello, Maggie, and Maggie and Karen and Dawn. But today I've just dreamt up a whole new idea. What if all my friends could call one phone number and reach a bunch of good baby-sitters?

So that's my idea for the Baby-sitters Club. It started with a few simple rules:

Have your own phone with a private line.

Have a job to refer people to when they need baby-sitting help (do they have to stay home, for instance, or are there other people taking their place?).

One person will be available for every job.

People could call one number and reach seven qualified sitters. And that's one person. I mean, no one can do all the sitting, but the number can be used for doing a lot of good baby-sitting. In a way, club business was fun even though it was new ground. As president, I was the one who came up with the idea. That’s how I met Claudia; she’s my other girlfriend, Logan.

Just then the front door slammed behind us. Kristy’s mother got out of bed and rushed toward the front door, but Stacey was still standing in front of the door. She turned her attention back to me. (Well, now that I think about, I’m outnumbered. I know that because we’ve had pretty different lives, but try as I might, I don’t remember everything that happened in the past week or so. In fact, it might be a long while.) Stacey ran over beside me, grabbed my backpack, led me into the kitchen, and stuck a plastic bag over the top of the refrigerator.

She started making cupcakes.

Stacey makes one for each class. I think she always makes one cupcake for each sitter, unless there’s an emergency.

The next thing I knew, I heard a person answer the door. It was Dawn. (Remember my surprise when I said that Dawn has blue eyes? Well, maybe it was because she is a big time nerd, just like Kristy. She has to do all this talking about sports and school. We all do, and she is a lot nicer than I think.

Dawn walked in, looking very nervous. I could tell she was going to start fiddling with her hair.

Well, Dawn said so.

Dawn’s not shy about talking about what happened. Even when she’s not bragging, she puts herself in people’s shoes. She’s very serious. Sometimes I think she knows she doesn’t need to tell everyone about what went on in her past, but I do. Dawn’s probably the most honest person I know, so I don
