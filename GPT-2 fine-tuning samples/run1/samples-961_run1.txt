 voicing out the news on the digital clock. (The paperclip that holds the news to my desk takes up the slack.)

"Mary Anne!" I heard my mom say, half jumping up and half crouching. "Wow, this is a very neat move, isn't it?"

"It isn't," Kristy admitted calmly, raising her hands as if holding her breath.

There was none of Kristy's usual self-confidence, though. I had finally convinced my mom that the move was pretty.

A wave of giggles and “head scratching” spread around the room as I zeroed in on Claudia and Stacey.

“I know that move,” Kristy commented, looking smug, "but what did I miss?"

"Don’t you miss Claudia and Stacey?" asked Stacey, speaking with a grin.

“Neither do I.”

“That’s just what I’m good at, and what I’ll be graduating to do, I guess — go to Stoneybrook High School," I said after glancing at Stacey’s ID. She was already in the hall. Our classes would always start on time, and we would usually be back after 9:30. We always know when the doors had opened or closed and when the main event was over.

“Great,” said Stacey. “The record book says we’ll be back around 5:30.

“Okay,” I said. “We’ll have a great time.” I adjusted my schedule and started my math class. By the time I got home from school, I already knew all my brothers and sisters, so I knew the math lesson all there. It was in the back of the book. I’m good in math, but I hate to miss it. It’s the only thing in my brain that says "no" all the time.

By now I’d learned a lot about how to handle new clients, especially new numbers and symbols. And now I had to give the book a try.

There. I’ll tell you how it went. I’ll begin by saying that the book is written by a good speller. What she’s, you ask. Well, I guess I do look like my standard example of spellers perfection. In fact, in the beginning, when I first got the book, I was so excited I almost gave up. I think I was the most scared of any of the girls because I saw all the scary faces and my head, so I actually thought my mother was going to call the cops if I ever showed up too late. But the idea came to me anyway and I was more than happy to obey her orders.

It was at first my absolute best not to show off, especially because I’m so good at being so. All the girls I’ve ever met have looked great. I even looked like a dancer, all my clothes and headbands and makeup almost as if I’d met someone already. But my face never looked as it should've anyway.

After a little lesson at school, I joined the army and began my first year as an officer in a big company singing team called the We ♥ Kids. I’m lucky to have the best school year ever because even though I’m only fifteen, I still feel like a teenager at heart. The only thing holding me back is that I hate being eleven, except for my brothers and sisters all the time. I like being with my brothers and sisters. Sometimes I cry when I hear about kids who are ten years old and who I’ve just met. In my case, it was just the rain. In my school’s, boy, I’ve been called a mean cat.

Even when Stacey is friendly about boys, I’m usually friendly about girls. But not when it comes to dating, I’m lucky. Stacey likes me, and we hang out all the time. We even look like the models. The sweetest, most gorgeous two-year-old in the world. Stacey likes to wear jeans, a turtleneck, sneakers, and shopping bags.

Stacey has a little sister, Becca, and a brother named Squirt. Their dad passed away several years ago when the girls were quite young. For a long time, the girls did too. We felt, too, that the girls did too. We think their families were much bigger then, and we think they are still sensitive to that.

Claudia and Mallory are our junior officers and best friends. Mostly we don’t like our names, though. (We used to prefer Claudia’s really ring-
