======== SAMPLE 1 ========
th (the only two) as headmistress of California. That day, Mary Anne said she had to go to California to be closer to Sharon. The rest, as you know, is history. (Kristy's family was once part-time, but that had to change.)

At 5:20, the meeting began. Mary Anne was on the phone, so I called her back to tell her who she would call. She called and hung up the phone. That is, it took her until 5:30 to get to me. When she hung up the phone, I was still on the phone. In only the second she hung up the phone and hung up the phone, she started talking to me. This thing about finding a job, that really isn't true. I mean, I'd better be as nice as Mary Anne and to the point the money would go toward all that other stuff. But she made a big speech about making a better life for her family — about taking care of kids and keeping a neat little business — and then she hung up the phone and said, "Okay, Mr. Barrett, that was a mistake. I'd have liked to see you do stuff with the club. But you were too bossy and too impatient, too, Mary Anne."

Next, Mary Anne hung on as you can see. She told me, "I couldn't make something work in that meeting." I think that's what Mary Anne meant. She knows that being bossy will make us all faint and leave. But if we stick to a steady job, we'll look after our families.

As you can probably guess, Mary Anne's family is the exact opposite of mine. Mary Anne has the most sophisticated (for me anyway) life — her parents are divorced, and her dad works as a writer and illustrator for a publishing company. Mary Anne's mother died when she was a baby, and Mary Anne's father and mother had a tense life before the divorce. This was before I began to understand why Mary Anne's family was so unhappy, and what might have gone wrong.

Mary Anne also tells me about the divorce. She was convinced Mary Anne had given her the wrong father and his two kids an immature attitude. Mary Anne's mother and father were not only mean (which is true, but still important to Mary Anne), they were also strict and I guess, immature. I don't know what I could do about that, but I'd love to spend some time at my dad's house and talk to him again, even if it meant spending some time with my brother, Charlie.

I'd like to spend some time with Charlie. The two of us don't usually go out much, but we do sometimes take part in weekend club jobs. I'd like to spend a few days with him just so he can be sure of a baby-sitting job. And I'd like to have some time with my brother, but I'd rather spend time with my friends (who live just a few streets away) than with a baby-sitting organization I don't know anything about.

Now on to the meeting as a whole. I was invited to take part, but I didn't make it. It was only for my own personal use, like when I had to look after the kids since my mom and I couldn't go to a TV viewing party (or to a gym). I guess that's just how meetings go. But it was nice being invited, even if it meant that I had to know much more about the job than I already knew.

Before long we were back at the table, and another group of people was sitting before us. We didn't meet on Monday, but the person sitting next to me said we were all free to take it, even though it was Monday since it was an informal meeting. Mr. Clayton, my father, and Mrs. Thomas are high school sweethearts and they both studied at Stoneybrook Special School.

"Hi, BSC! Howdy!" said Mr. Clayton, pulling on the record book he keeps on his person.

"That was fun, too, but that day I didn't see any new baby-sitting baby-sitters in sight!" said Mrs. Thomas. Her first job as club secretary was to check the records for the Saturday job.

"We all have our favorites, too, since most of the children don't want to do that," said Claud. "So we put the BSC on hold when we needed to start new groups. But the Monday before those meetings comes when the BSC has to make up new stories for jobs, and most of the time when we have new clients or we haven't been making up new stories already. It's almost a two-hour meeting, with no snacks to be had."

This time the whole BSC was out of the meeting. I couldn't tell how many people we had. I remember how
