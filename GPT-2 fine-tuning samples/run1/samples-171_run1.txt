 who is a real, live person.) She also loves the outdoors. Her love of reading, especially horse story, is something she has a steady hand in. She also gets to lead her kids to school after school, all in the name of school. (She can be stubborn about that, just like Kristy, who can, really.) She's also an avid horse-sitting coach.

Dawn McGill lives just steps away from Kristy, which is why she is our junior associate member. She and Mal's younger brother, David Michael, are two of my least favorite baby-sitters at the moment. I don't want to call their parents names, however, and I'd hate to, but that is the nature of professional sports. Dawn is an only child, born to two parents. She gets up early at three o'clock the morning after every sitting job (she has to be there all day, all day) and goes to bed at five o'clock that day. She does this at a great rate, because she has a schedule, like a pencil and a piece of meat. Dawn has never, ever told anyone how to do a job. (I know she did, but it wasn't because she was scared. She was just trying to do well!) Dawn is the treasurer of the BSC. She collects dues every Monday, and that money helps pay Mal's phone bill. It was not an easy thing to do, though, because Dawn is a real math whiz. Sometimes Mal's numbers are so stupid, she has to be exact with math all the time. You only have to look at Mal's house to notice that she has eight kids to baby-sit for at one time. That's when she's not baby-sitting one-on-one.

Mary Anne is our other junior associate member. She's also our junior officer. She and Dawn have never met yet, but what they did find is that Mary Anne's school has a record book with notes about where Mary Anne's friends and family live. That's where I met Dawn’s dad. (His name sounds suspicious, because he’s short for Dawn’s birth name and because he's white.)

Dawn and Mary Anne began their friendship in high school when Dawn moved to Stoneybrook from California. (As you might have gathered from her home address, Kristy says she’s still thinking of Stacey and me.) But Mary Anne’s history with Stacey kept growing. It occurred to Dawn, then, that Dawn’s parents were divorced just a few months later. In fact, Dawn's stepsister just happens to live in the same house as Mary Anne’s, so Dawn was thrilled when she met the Mary Anne and Stacey parents. But in the end, Dawn decided she wasn’t ready for Stacey. She didn’t want to be married to someone who was dating someone with her whole family and to living in a blended home with Claudia and Andrew. So I gave up.

Mary Anne and Dawn are really close, but their parents got divorced a long time ago, when their mom was living in California with her dad. Even though Mary Anne and Adam and Claudia’s parents are divorced now, they still talk a good lot about their dad. (That’s what Dawn refers to as "having a huge life" — like having eight kids or ten if I’ll forget) Mary Anne is more than happy to be treated like this. She’s also a mom. And an active parent. I should mention that Dawn is very nice and kind, and that she’s an incredibly strong individual. She’s also a dedicated musician and she loves to write music. And she’s also an amazing athlete and a great horse. This is a fantastic combination, Dawn. But the main advantage Mary Anne has over Adam and Claudia is that she isn’t very concerned about her looks. She’s short, with brown hair, almond-shaped eyes (yes, all eyes!), and a little bit of brownish-brown skin. Mary Anne’s also very artistic. She has to keep a good artistic IQ while still being a good artist.

Mal and I are the only eleven-year-old twins. Mal moved to Stoneybrook from California several years ago. She loves sports and is really into sports. She and Adam are both great basketballers. Mal is tall, with brown hair, blue eyes, and curly dark-brown skin which gives her some of her personality. (She also has a secret weapon, which is a big knife.) She dresses modestly, mostly in casual clothes, but she has a great sense of style. She recently added red and yellow sparkly-painted leggings to her usual collection.

Another thing that Mal is good at is sports. Mal’s mother died when Mal was very young
