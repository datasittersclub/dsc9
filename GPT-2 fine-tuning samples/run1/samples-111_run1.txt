 to go to an art exhibition. She had arrived for one of those shows. As soon as David Thomas reached Stoneybrook, Claudia got off to a great start.

Kristy had grown up in New York City. Her family moved here in the 1950s and she lived there for the rest of her life. This was after Kristy was sent to Vietnam, where Kristy's father served as the alternate officer. This meant that after Kristy's dad died, she didn't have to worry about being the next officer of the company. She did care about the baby-sitting jobs. But the most important job was with the club. When Kristy's dad arrived in Vietnam, Kristy's mom was so upset that she threw herself into a new line of caring for the kid. She would never be part of a baby-sitting company that was too overloaded for her, and she was even more upset when the baby-sitter for her dad's company, BSC, got sick while waiting for him to take a job. Then she tried to find a good baby-sitter for Stoneybrook. She had a phone number right away. She called back to arrange the job.

Kristy didn't know where to begin searching — she just wanted people to know what was happening on her side and to find an appointment. Claudia, a very nice woman, she had just moved away from New York City and came to New York City for college.

We had a great time, with Claudia, the rest of the club, and an excellent club meeting. In between meetings, Kristy and I talked about who would best serve as president of the club. The best one would be Kristy, and the second best would be Mal. Both of us were thirteen (and our parents are eleven) and very alike in the way we looked. Both of us looked younger than Kristy, but both were taller and more mature. Kristy is tall and very athletic, while Mal is tall and quiet and very short.

Kristy has this amazing sense of humor, and she always puts herself in the most creative of situations. She is a very special person, and one of those special people is herself.

She has short, curly reddish brown hair and brown eyes and freckles. She lives with her parents and her older sister, Janine, who is eight. Her brother, David Michael, lived with them two years ago when he was in Vietnam. (They moved back to Stoneybrook — and Kristy and her dad joined the BSC again, this time to help out with its baby-sitting business.)

Kristy's parents are divorced, and they have eight kids together (one of whom is named Abby). They make some money with each job because their children use their parents' money, so they have three jobs that they can take on at once: they pay the dues, bookkeeping, and expenses (such as gas money for a baby-sitter's phone bill). But even after all those jobs, they need Kristy's funds to pay the club dues. And while that's a bit of a pain, the parents have the money to buy things for Kristy, she supplies the necessary supplies for them, and they end up having a successful company.

I didn't even talk about Kristy yet because — well — as soon as I said that the last job she ever dreamed up was that of one of Claudia Kishi's girls, it sounded less like a joke and more like a real dream. Kristy couldn't be happier. It's true. She has to be a grown-up in order to reach everyone's dreams.

Kristy is also a professional athlete. And she's so. She's an incredibly athletic high school junior who just became an alternate officer. One day when it looked like Claudia's old man had been taking a lot of baby-sitting jobs, he decided to take the alternate officer job — and he was so nervous that he cried.

Kristy's family lived in this house for quite a long time, since they were the first people to arrive at Claudia's house. (They were eight and only five, though they used to live in one house now.) They were also the first children to live in an apartment. One of them was Karen, a babyless girl who could barely walk, talk, play, and play. And Kristy, by the way, has an almond-shaped ear, like her best friend.

Kristy, as I mentioned earlier, is an excellent student. She doesn't like math, but she has strong opinion about any subject. Some of her opinions may be wrong, like Claudia's. Some of them may be true. And some of them may be not.

Kristy is incredibly talented, but she doesn't like the way things are. She isn't the kind of student who gets herself into trouble.

I told you so much about Krist
