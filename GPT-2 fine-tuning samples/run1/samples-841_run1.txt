 Mary, but I didn't really have much hope of that. I looked up romantic stories in Shakespeare's library, of course. But one of Shakespeare's mysteries had to be one he'd seen somewhere and understood. If I'd had an opportunity to pick up that mystery story, I'd want to know it. That's how I always think.

As soon as I'd picked it up, I looked in the library and the men and boys were talking about it. And then I opened my math book and saw that the boys were talking about it too.

Which is why I keep thinking of Claud and Dawn as my best friend. They're really close.

I guess Kristy, after all those years in the BSC, is crazy. She always seems to be a little off, and I think she is, sometimes. But she's a lot of fun, and I like the fact that she has good ideas. This is probably a good thing, because a lot of BSC members think she's the queen of ideas. She's the one who thought up the idea for Kid-Kits, for example. The ones made by Marguerite Henry and decorated in pink and white by Marguerite Corman. Each of them has had special instructions from the beginning (like, tell me about the Mystery Cakes and Cookies and Powders, and the Krushers) to create every puzzle and cranny in Claudia's bedroom. But, as Claudia would often say, the queen's ideas are usually the best.

You know who else is the queen of ideas? Kristy, queen of chaos, queen of chaos. She's known as the Queen of Chaos because, although she's not the most organized person in the world, she shows up not at meetings, usually with a big news conference or a big traffic or with a big (believe me, I know) endorsement. She even wears her belt (the red one is for Dawn, the blue one for Kristy). Which is kind of interesting, because Claud is totally obsessed with Claudia, and is determined to be queen of chaos.

Claudia's a real nut about Claudia's junk food. She lives with her mom and older sister, Janine, who are real nut shops, but she visits her dad's, if you can believe it. (Mrs. Kishi lives in an old house near the Kishis.) Anyway, Claudia's a real junk food nut, and her mom and Tigger, who is her kitten, also eat horse-print sweaters, which Claud calls "the carpet." She claims it looks great, but the truth is Claud's parents didn't want her to eat aerobically-challenged cotton candy. So she went to a junk-food store and bought something really, really bad — twerking and elephant-skin earrings. Claud loves earrings and she loves all the cool stuff in her room, but these aren't things she often looks at. For example, she has an ancient Egyptian collection under control, which she keeps checked out by her parents.

Claud's best friend is Stacey McGill. Stacey's an associate BSC member, which means that she doesn't usually come to meetings. But she's never missed an all-girl BSC meeting. Which is surprising because Stacey and McGill have been best friends practically since they were born. They're very different. Both of them are very cool.

Stacey's an independent type of girl. She lives in a rat's nest (well, sort of like the other side of Manhattan). She has soft red hair and blue eyes and she wears her hair into her dressing session the weekend before her big BSC meeting. But most of the time, she's not wearing a bra yet. She's wearing this uniform of long blonde hair that has been left up for the next semester. Like Claudia, Stacey is a dancer. (I think she's the opposite of Claudia in some ways — performance art is her art.) Stacey loves to do ballet, and she takes college dance classes, too.

Well, Stacey is a bona fide ballet goodie. She's not only in the top two in all the BSC members' comp classes, but she's number two in the whole science section and number four in one of math. If this were a mathematical field, the fact is that Stacey would probably enter the dance program with two straight Achievers' Degrees missing, since her parents have two divorces — her mother and father, plus a heartbroken mother and a sweet but broken man in high school.

Not all college students can't work toward a BSC class with two top primers (Stacey does, but only when they have time). But those people are Mary Anne Spier and Claudia Kishi, the other one of us members.
