======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a number of us with whom to tie up a client list. She's an excellent tie-in.

How about us? Well … We're club members mainly because we're excellent sitters. We're good at a lot of jobs, and we're great at getting new clients. Our clients aren’t new, of course. I’m not talking about all of our sitters, either. But I have to say that Mallory Pike and Jessica Ramsey are excellent baby-sitters. Those are our two sitting charges. They both have jobs we can’t do all at once. For example, Mallory wants to be a baby-sitter at Claudia’s, so she has to give herself up soon after her seventh birthday. The rest of us can’t sit at night, unless it’s for our own families.

Now, there is one more thing. Jessi Ramsey and Mal are eleven. What that means is that they are eleven and in the sixth grade. Like me, they can’t sit at night unless it’s for their own families. But their families might be a lot bigger than Claud’s and Nannie’s and Marnie’s. I guess the reason we baby-sit for them is partly artistic. They’re talented, too.

Now that you’re in the club, let me tell you about my closest friend.

Like a lot of BSC members, Jessi and Mal are in seventh grade. But Jessi is really talented. She’s taken ballet seriously in high school and just as seriously these days. Jessi is also an incredible ballet dancer. Her long arms, smooth skin, dark eyes, and perfect posture make her stand out as one of today’s ballet dancers.

Mal is African-American, with beautiful features. She’s beautiful, too. She has reddish-brown hair, glasses, and braces. Jessi never has to wear the most awful color to a dressing-table audience. That is because she’d never make one mistake.

To tell you the truth, I would never mistake Mal for a dancer. She’s a phenomenal dancer. She moves very dramatically, gets her size right, gets on the toes of a foot fast, and does ballet-like things. She even looks her age, though. Mal is the oldest of eight kids (including triplets). She has seven brothers and sisters.

When you have all that, you’re going to be very impressed with what you see. Not that Logan’s in any shape yet. And not even close.

Jessi is the oldest baby-sitter in her family, too. Her mom and dad are still married when the sixth grade comes around. (Remember that?) Anyway, Jessi and Mal are both a bit heavier than average, and have wackier appetites. Jessi has a little-kid-like appearance. Is that bad? That’s the opposite. She’s very graceful and graceful and smart (not as loud as I’m used to be, although I like her). She runs, she plays soccer, she reads Nancy Drew books, and she’s smart. As I said, she just loves sports. She’s an extremely talented athlete.

Jessi’s best friend is her mom. Jessi just happens to be the oldest of eight members of the BSC. But most of the time, she’s the one with the big ideas. That’s the reason she keeps pushing the boundaries. Jessi’s ambition is to be an author-illustrator of kids’s books. She gets her doctorate in English from Stoneybrook Day School (where she’s a finalist for it). She’s also an artist.

Like Mal, Jessi has a beautiful figure. She’s tall and graceful, and she walks with a grace and her own sense of style.

I’m not sure if you’d ever meet Jessi, but you should by now (she’s my best friend). She lives with her parents and her two older brothers, Charlie and Sam. Her dad walked out one day when Dawn went back to California to live with her grandparents. Mrs. Schafer came to the house to find that Dawn was absent from a special summer camp and Mr. Spier — who had been Dawn’s friend and a good boyfriend then — was calling everyone at the Schafer home every day to make extra phone calls.

The Schafers had been working hard to fill Sharon with the children so that Dawn could visit her brother, her mom, her dad, and her brothers and her old friends, my dad, Jeff and Andrew. But one thing wasn’t working against
