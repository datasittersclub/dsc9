 — a trend that I think we Americans have been dying to see a little more seriously lately. That's right — we're in a serious art festival. I think we're going to see some really terrific works of art there. And I love hanging with kids — especially kids I know and love — in my projects. I have a bunch of great ideas, and I'm constantly being inspired by their creativity. We're so lucky to have such a cool group of people at our meetings.

I'm vice-president of the BSC because we meet in my room and use my phone. I can be reached at anytime during non-meeting hours, and we can easily talk about a project. If we went into a club with only one person (maybe Kristy or Stacey), the phone wouldn't be as busy. (Well, not as much as we could manage, but still!)

Kristy lives with her parents, her brother, her three brothers (two older, one younger); Kristy's mom; her stepfather, Watson; and her kitten, Tigger. She can walk, talk, and read at the same time. Watson is an awesome cat, but he's so into it that he once gave her a Johanna, the sugar-flavored fruit that your body would expect a normal kitten to crave. (But it is a diabetic, so please don't put an apple in the mix.) Kristy is an individual. No one thing equals a happiness day.

Kristy's best friend, Mary Anne Spier, is, if anything, more organized than Kristy. In addition to being treasurer and president, she loves to baby-sit. While Kristy and Mary Anne handle a lot of our business (boring), it's Mary Anne who goes over our schedules and takes an in-demand sitter's order off the books. I'll never forget the time we played Ping-Pong on Claudia's one night when we were baby-sitting, and I realized how easy it was for her to get crummy ideas for fun things like party favors for the friends who are neighbors or buy things at our local fair. Who knows, maybe someday we'll be able to hold the board and decide who can enter the Krushers or who can't.

Mary Anne is our club vice-president, mainly because she's the only member who can take over the duties of secretary and sitter when a client calls. She's pretty, with brown hair and eyes (she looks fine) and goes to a private school called Stoneybrook Day School. Unlike Kristy and Kristy’s other closest friends, Mary Anne and Kristy are not like one in which there’s an absence. Instead, there is a coordinated presence, one that’s very much at the level of a zoo’s at that school. She works full-time to support the families in our neighborhood.

Like Dawn, Mary Anne’s family is African American. While Dawn’s skin color is a big draw, most of the neighbors in that neighborhood are white. This doesn’t exist in Stoneybrook, and I don’t mean that everybody is bad. It’s just that neighbors don’t always understand.

Mary Anne is only best friended by one of her best friends, Mary Anne’s mother. After Mr. Spier got married to his former high school sweetheart, he invited her to join the BSC. Not long after they started the club, Dawn’s mother began making phone calls, and nobody seemed to be ready to replace her.

After looking at the record book, I determined that the perfect person for Dawn’s job would be that she take over the duties of mother and grandmother after Mr. Spier died.

So, that’s my first complete list of best friends. That’s because I knew Mary Anne over the phone and could figure out which one of us should enter the BSC on the first day. I was thrilled that way since Mary Anne and I have been best friends practically since we were born. We have a lot in common, even though we are both pretty different. Mary Anne’s mother is an invalid and had better be sent back to be a minor. Mr. Spier has been extremely loving since he saw the Bible. (Mary Anne’s father walked out on her family at the end of seventh grade and never looked back.) Mr. Spier used to say, “Everything will be okay, Mary Anne!” but things have been hard on him at times. He’s done a good job of trying to keep things going smoothly but I think he really has to go through a tough time today since he isn’t a nice person.

The one person who’s changed the most since I was born is Dawn Schafer. She has moved from California to
