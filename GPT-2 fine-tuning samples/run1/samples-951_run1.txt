======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the guy who works at that big company.

Our two associate members are Logan Bruno (Mary Anne's boyfriend, remember?) and Shannon Kilbourne. They don't come to meetings often, but they’re ready to fill in when we need help, and they’re both great sitters. Shannon is very independent, with only one thing: two holes in each earlobe. She loves to read, and she also loves to write. She’s really talented. She’s going to be a children’s book author someday, and she’s dying for that title!

As for me — well, I have nothing against any of those things. I’m as excited as anyone else about learning to drive (I can actually make the Colby, N.J., suburb goow). But if anything, like bragging about being the world’s fastest adult, I can’t help loving all that reading, I must be really turning down Shannon’s adoring gaze. (That’s one reason I am so nervous about seeing Mallory! She and Shannon are so close.)

I know, I’m bragging, but I’m also making a different remark. “Are you sure you can keep all of that book the same?”

“I promised Jessi and me.”

“True.”

“And I promised Mary Anne and me.”

“I’m going to try to buy some stuff!”

“I forgot to mention that —”

The door was suddenly slammed immediately.

“Mal! Hi!” I cried. I clutched the back of my handbag behind my head. “Are you really blind? I’m not! I’m going to see Mal in one piece. A lot of people look at me. You know, like I do. I mean, I don’t, like, take anything for granted, but I am not thinking about art classes. I’m really blind, and I don’t really know what to tell anybody.”

Mary Anne sat down next to me and gently rubbed the back of her headband of her teflon bun with the tip of her tongue. “You know best,” she said, looking a little flushed. “But Mal will be able to tell you in no time at all. She’ll just have to wait for the others to arrive.”

“Great!” I said. “Let me think about it a little more. Once we’re in Stoneybrook, that’s all.”

“Good,” said the doctor. “It seems you’re ready to give Mal the treatment she needs.”

“Okay,” I said, trying to listen to Mary Anne. “Give her the formula and injections, and she’ll go fast.”I could feel myself nodding along, since I was sure that she was dying to give her a little more time. I decided the best course of action was for Mary Anne to start with a tube of high-quality teflon, which she’d kept in a tiny bag she’d made up with glitter in the shape of a face. She’d made a nice fingerprint by sticking it on a piece of teflon she’d kept inside her nose. Now that she’d chilled, what would she think? Fashion? Well, she’d probably change her mind about the tube or injections and get back to her old self. But Mary Anne wasn’t exactly dying at the sight of the teflon. It didn’t look right to her as the brunette wore it with poppies under her eye ringlets. Would she want to? The poppies were what made her fall in love again? Of course, it wouldn’t be the same without the glitter. But she was dying it, and she still was dying to try it.The next thing we knew, we were just outside. It was time to head out again. The wind picked up some more, and we trooped out of Claudia’s bedroom onto Bradford Court.A policeman sitting in a thick-set, kind of white as a cornice, bicycle parked just outside the door, looking stricken, while a couple of girls playing soccer passed by.Just then, a huge wave crashed the court, smashing everything in sight. Everyone’s eyes met, everyone began singing, “Oh, ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-” (Surfingers Sound, Part I). The wind picked up, and the waves were still pounding the
