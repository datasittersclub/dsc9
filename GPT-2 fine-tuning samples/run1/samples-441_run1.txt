 again. But that isn't what prompted Kristy’s mom and Watson, who happen to be real bloodsippers, to come in and pull out these really shocking BSC records. The official BSC record, which I’ll tell you about later, will tell you a bit about the club and the people who hold it up. Kristy and Mary Anne’s mom used to live with their father and her mom still lives with his mother. They are pretty much the same person (Kristy has brown hair, Mary Anne has a very big mouth, her family is pretty much the same as before). Like Kristy’s mom, Mary Anne’s father used to shop at thrift stores, but now he just lives in his old house. (The house is a real thrift store! Kristy’s mom bought a colonial colonial mansion, which is a good thing because it allows her to live in it longer.) Mrs. Pike has two older children — Dawn and Jeff — and since Dawn and Mary Anne live in California, all three of them live there with their father, and have been here since before Dawn’s any kind of news, it’s pretty much the same.

The club was Kristy’s idea, and she’s the one who’s been bossy and sometimes bossy this year. But it worked so well, that she became president last summer. In fact, she made the meeting to order.

“Here we are!” bellowed Kristy, taking the pen from her knee and clicking it away.

“What order are they?” I’d asked her, trying to keep up with the others.

But she didn’t seem to notice. She always has a good eye for detail. “The president was in charge of the BSC record book, which is another of Kristy’s great ideas. It’s like a diary, but in a very professional way. What happens is that the record book is a computer program that the secretary writes in a pencil. Each member of the club has to read every word that’s written in the book and then record it in a report card so that each member knows exactly when a new client comes in. I have to say I’m impressed with Kristy’s way of getting things done. Even so, she’s so busy that I thought I’d never heard her speak in a while.

“I don’t care about spelling,” Kristy was saying now.

“I’m not really a speller,” said Mary Anne, looking up from the club notebook. And just then, Mary Anne started to fill the notebook. “What’s going on here?” she asked, trying to catch up on what had just happened.

“Well, I think one of the things that’s driving this is that Jeff and I are going to have to move to Watson’s house. I think Watson’s going away, but I think we can’t go anywhere without his permission.”

“How is it going to be with Daddy?” asked Kristy. “I’ve got a new baby brother, a red headed seven year old named Andrew, and a new friend, Mrs. Thomas,” Watson has become one of the most loyal (almost) reliable friends I ever had the pleasure of knowing. And I think Watson is going to be just fine with Andrew, too.

Kristy rolled her eyes. “Well, you will now, Dawn, but first we must make a decision about going to Watson’s.”

Mrs. Thomas is the oldest in her family, and it is a good thing Kristy’s older sister, Emily, is a real health-food maniac. Kristy is lucky to have her around. And she and her two older brothers, Sam and Charlie, live in Watson’s mansion just across town. But Kristy has two little sisters from her mother’s marriage and a baby brother, named Andrew.

Now you know everything that happened in the club. I’ll just tell you about each of the four members (including their conflicts of interest), including a little bit about the alternate officer, Dawn Schafer.

I was going to skip on this because I’m the only member with a personal computer and I’ve lived in California since the beginning of seventh grade. But I was trying to keep things straight about Dawn, so I waited. She came to my house just in time just in time — when I needed a sitter for Kristy’s two-year-old brother, David Michael. (Neither Kristy nor Mary Anne had ever heard of
