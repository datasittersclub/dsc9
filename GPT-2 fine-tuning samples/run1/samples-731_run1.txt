 we have to be very careful what we spend. For example, what are we supposed to buy at supermarkets and convenience stores? What kind of food does Momofuku make? What kind of junk food does Momofuku make?

Mary Anne and the other members of our club are somewhat of a mess right now. We don’t have a ton of regular jobs. Our club meets in Claudia’s bedroom three times a week, runs the gamut from club events to after-school sports team meetings. We also don’t have any good positions. For example, Kristy Thomas is our president and founder member, which means she tries to be as organized (and efficient, too) as possible. Plus, we use her room and her phone. Claud takes baby-sitting jobs when she can.

Our club has officers, dues, and a system for paying dues. We pay dues each Monday, and that covers the costs. We also use the money for things we need. For example, snacks, lessons, and transportation. For Christmas 2010, we had to replace two of the club members, and we splurge on both tickets. Another reason we’re so happy is that our junior officers, Jessica Ramsey, were named junior because they’re not allowed to baby-sit on rainy days and don’t have adult entertainment in their repertoires (such as Ring-Dings or Ring-Ding.)

While all the above are negatives — junior officers feeling uncomfortable about being replaced, for one thing — they are positives. They make us more organized and can help us win new clients faster.

Mal and Jessi are a perfect pair. They are the oldest kids in their families — eight kids (eight in a family) and three and a half. They are also very different. Mal has eight younger siblings (including a set of triplets). In fact, her siblings are so different that it wasn’t hard for us to figure out which sibling was which. Mal’s is eight kids. Two other girls are also members: they’re eleven and in high school. They’re my friends, Claudia and Mary Anne. Come to think of it, we’re almost sisters now.

Okay, now our club meets three times a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from five-thirty (sharp!) until six. That means that our clients can call before meetings to set up appointments. We meet those days because we’re always available to sit for our charges.

For club business, our secretary, Mary Anne Spier, is our maid of honor. She’s the only one of us who has a real official title.

Now that you know a little bit about Mary Anne, let me tell you about Kristy, our club secretary, and our treasurer. As I said, I’m in charge of keeping our club record book up-to-date. As I said, it’s full of complicated schedules.

I should know, I’m the secretary of Kristy’s family. Our record book contains most of our other stuff, such as Claudia’s appointment pages, the appointment calendar (which is strictly a calendar), the account book (which is a record of our jobs), and the job ads. I also keep track of our baby-sitting experience with the families we baby-sit for. For example, if two of us are going on a vacation, Kristy likes to stay in Kristy’s gorgeous mansion because her big house is on the other side of town.

If you go to any one of her many, many phone calls, Kristy can be incredibly frantic. She goes to her headquarters on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to find sitting jobs. In the middle of these frantic times, she takes all kinds of great steps toward becoming our new Charmed Personality.

Take Kristy. She is so outgoing and outgoing, too. Some people call her bossy. That gets her down easily and keeps her company while the other members are at their lunches. We all depend on her for assistance in our club meetings.

Our other newest member is Shannon Kilbourne. She’s Kristy’s best friend ever since they first met. They grew up together. They’re just like Kristy. Both of them are the oldest kids in their families. Shannon has two younger brothers, Buddy and Ryan. Both of them play on a softball team called Kristy’s Krushers.

Shannon doesn’t come from a large family. She has eight kids (including triplets). Shannon has a little sister, Emily Michelle, who came from Vietnam. Shannon wears her blonde hair in a cool, American way. She has healthy, curly brown hair, blue eyes, and very much a life.
