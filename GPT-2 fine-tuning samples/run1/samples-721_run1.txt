 across the country, and she’s taking advantage of that. She has a real talent for putting together great ideas (a talent she says she’s developed over the years) and she really works hard. No doubt about it. You’d never guess how many pairs of eyes she has, and you’d know right away which of them has the prettiest dress. She’s not shy about saying what she thinks, and I think she always knows what’s on her mind.

What was your first impression of Claudia? How would you rate her?

Thanks, Mary Anne, for that valuable information!

Next are Jessi and Mallory. They’re sixth-graders. They’re the creative kids at SMS. They’re good at a lot of things, but mostly just memorize things like Jay-Z’s All-Star catch phrase and Ring-Dressing Booth.

That’s it! Yours is all I got! I’m way over-the-top sometimes. I think they’re pretty creative. Jessi’s an artistic ballerina who studies ballet as much as she can, and practices a lot. She dances en pointe, which is a fancy way of saying ballet jump rope.

Mal is talented, too, in some ways. She’s a real athlete, like Dawn Schafer when they were kids. Jessi has skin (or no skin) too. Like Dawn, she’s got long, bouncy hair. She’s also got a kitten named Tigger. (Tiggers is the opposite of Tigger, cute, huh?) Mal likes to use Nancy Drew books (which she buys at the store) and her backpack. You never know when the next Kid-Kit is on sale, since the kids — all their toys, new knickknacks, and all their games!

And all of them (except me) have nicknames. Mallory’s “mellowmouths” and “billy-gooaters” are her real ones. She also loves to read, especially horse stories by Marguerite Henry, which she’s addicted to.

So those are my friends. Of them, only Mallory is truly brilliant. That’s what makes her such a great BSC president. (Also, I can’t pick one, truly brilliant,” I think, but six of the nine members of the BSC will do!) She’s not only head of the BSC, she’s the BSC’s treasurer, and she contributes nothing to the overall treasury. That’s because the BSC was her idea, and she really knows how to use her club dues to pay for things like Claud’s phone bill and gas for the Junk Bucket.

Nowadays, Mallory lives with her parents, her adopted sister, Vanessa (and her brother), her aunt Cecelia, and her baby brother, Squirt. He’s just two, but they’re incredibly close.

Another thing Mallory has is a brother who she’s close friends with. His name is John Philip Ramsey and he’s really into his younger sister, Janine, who’s nine. But the best part? Since Mal’s nine, she doesn’t have a brother.

So, can you guess who my BSC best friend will be? I’ll be around Claudia’s for an entire meeting.

Speaking of best friends, the BSC holds a meeting every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty (sharp) to six o’clock in Claudia’s bedroom. We don’t do the usual mailing-in checks on the day we meet, but during that time we forget nothing — things — and hardly ever use the BSC “homestuck.” (The club notebook is where we write about our jobs.)

Kristy Thomas is the BSC president. She’s very macho and very informal.

Kristy’s style is very much her own. But don’t confuse cool for bossy. I think the BSC model is Ms. Cool.

Kristy is a super idea person. She’s also a tomboy who loves sports. (I have to say that her sports are basketball and baseball.) She’s not a great student-athlete — not even close. But she’s got a good mind for numbers, and just about everything she does is a big brain.

So, can you guess who my best friend will be? I think that’s impossible, since I’ve already told you about two other BSC members (D
