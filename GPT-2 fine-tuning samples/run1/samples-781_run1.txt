======== SAMPLE 1 ========
oney's hair is thick, thick, and curly. She often wears an oversized pair of oversized socks. Dawn’s closet was made from four different construction materials: clay, wood, cotton, and some kind of fabric such as a pillow or a piece of fabric that will stick together just like glue. Dawn has never once used a construction material other than Tocopherol.

Clay is pigsty. It dries quickly, so Tocopherol sticks to it. It was Dawn’s idea to make a disposable barrettes. She makes clothes in it and paints. In fact, Dawn likes the puns. I sometimes think she’s the most carnal person on Earth.

She has two younger sisters and a little dog, Buddy. Like the rest of us, her parents are divorced. Like Stacey and Tigger, her dad is in Manhattan. Like Mal and Jessi, he’s moving back to Stoneybrook. His last name is Arnold Schwarzenegger. They moved because their father was fired. Like Stacey and Tigger, they have asthma and lots of problems with prescription medicine.

Not long ago, Dawn met my old boyfriend Robert Brewster, who works for a publishing company in California. They fell in love, and instantly they fell in love again. Right away, he introduced them to new clients — Shannon Kilbourne, a BSC member who lives across town, and a new client who also happens to live in California.

Dawn had known that all along, since they had dated, that after they’d had a falling out. Mary Anne and I had been in a few movies together (I swear that I remember the first time we fell in love), and she had made a few friends in the house, but then Dawn had decided that all that had changed. She’d come back to Stoneybrook, and Robert had started dating Shannon's new boyfriend, Logan. Now he’d done a nice job getting the couple married, and now Mary Anne and her friends were happy about getting to know Dawn and Robert.

Dawn is now what I think of as my California girl. She has a cool, laid-back style — jeans, a T-shirt, and sneakers. She’s a health-food nut, but I think that’s about it. And with “Dawn,” according to her, she isn’t worried about her appearance and is happy to be an urban outcast, where nothing seems to bother her. (I’m not. Mostly I’d like to live in Palo City, California, on the other side of town.)

Since Dawn’s moved here, it’s seemed like a good place for her. We’ve been friends for a long time and have even been BSC members. But now Dawn has moved, too. She moved here, not long ago, with her brother, Jeff, who is a train wreck. That’s where she grew up — on her own — and now she is an individual with her own way of thinking and doing things. She is also a strong person (she can stand up to her mother, who is a strong person too), independent, open about her thoughts and opinions, and outspoken. (For example, I’m the only member of the BSC who wears necklaces because I’m diabetic myself.)

Now that you know Dawn’s full name, which I’ll try to do later, here’s how Dawn and I ended up as a BSC member. First off, Dawn and I are a very close family. We love health food and reading. We also eat red and mangled up creations such as tofu and rice out of plastic bags. The more I read and learn about the people and things around me, the more interesting it seems to me that some of the people in our family may be different (like David Michael, who I think grew up on Long Island), or that maybe some of our friendships are a little too personal for this. As you can guess, Dawn’s family is, well, interesting.

Then there are Mary Anne’s and Richard, Mary Anne’s kids’ best friend (and stepsister), who are best friends and have even dated. They also happen to be stepsisters. (That’s not true, though. Mary Anne’s mom married a really cool guy named Robert.) Mary Anne gained a boyfriend just like Richard did, and soon the rest of us joined the BSC.

Now that I’m an established guy in Stoneybrook, and as such I’m the treasurer of a big, friendly family that includes Kristy Thomas (who happens to be my best friend), Dawn Schafer (who happens to be my best friend), and my step-father, Watson. I
