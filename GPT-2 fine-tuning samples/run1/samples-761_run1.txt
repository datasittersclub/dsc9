When Shannon won the debate, Jessi came home, too. Her dad still lives nearby.

Those are the people Jessi comes to when I come to meetings. They're my relatives. My grandmother Janine, who lived next door to Watson when Watson and Jessi met here at Stoneybrook Community Center. That’s great, because Watson and Jessi find that Jessi’s school performance problems are that she isn’t very smart, and she ends up moving back to New York (where her native address is Watson’s house). So Jessi took good care of herself.

Now, Watson and I have different schedules. That’s okay. I figure I can handle things any time. I figure out Jessi’s favorite sport (mellow kebabs or anything to do with that), about six meals a week — that’s Jessi’s favorite activity.

At this meeting, Dawn Schafer was standing in front of Claudia’s bed with her hands on her hips, writing down the information she needed to know about the meeting, and telling everyone to arrive by 5:30. I don’t know the exact time that mark, but it’s at least five minutes before Claudia’s digital clock reads 5:30.

“I’ll be there, Jessi, even though it’s three-thirty,” I said. “I have this tape measure right here on my wrist.”

“Very good,” she replied. “You’re doing awfully well.”

“That’s why I’m vice-president.”

“I see, that’s right. I’ll take over as vice-president. If you don’t mind, I’ll take over my job.”

I was getting more and more nervous.

“I’ll get it?” I asked.

Kristy tapped out her trademark nervousness. “What?”

Claudia’s eyebrows wrinkled.

“I’ll tell you all about it in two sentences. One about the meeting, and the other about the news.”

I read the first sentence. “The meeting came to order almost exactly as I’d told you about it.”

“That is truly remarkable,” said Kristy, who had looked at the clock. “I should have known it would come 5:30, instead I’d told you it would be.”

“That’s great,” said Stacey McGill, holding up her wrist watch.

Abby Black, Jessi’s friend, burst out laughing.

“I’m so excited!” Claudia said.

I must have been really sick when the meeting ended. We hadn’t known what to do. I got up and left Claudia’s room.

I went home to cry a little. My mind raced a lot. Was that what you want when you want to be a best friend? Giving people a chance at acceptance?

I thought about Mal and Jessi; the other girls, and the phone. I thought about Claudia, Mr. and Mrs. DeWitt. I wanted them to forget about Stoneybrook. And I wanted them to be friends again.<|endoftext|>
I think I’ve been romanticizing Logan since Logan went away to California. And I know that most of the rest of us felt the same way as I did. But maybe I should explain a little more about my friends. I’m pretty famous, maybe even a lot of people. Remember that I said I was famous back then? Well, I’m in the audience of a Broadway musical now, Logan. And I used to be treated like that, a famous name. Now I’m an honorary member of the BSC. But there’s a limit to how famous I can be!

I went through a phase one of the BSC when I realized how lucky I was to have such a good group of friends. Everyone respects me as the best of friends, even if some of the people around me are the worst. But I admit that when it comes to being famous, the BSC really falls into the group style. We like talking about people, we like joking about people, and we love being around kids and people who are not as busy as we are. We just don’t care what other people think we are or what they do.

One more thing. I don’t love my hair. I actually think that my hair is
