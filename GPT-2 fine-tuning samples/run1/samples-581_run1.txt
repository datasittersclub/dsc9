 and the kids,"” Dr. Johanssen told Mary Anne and Claudia in a kiss.

"I don’t believe we do it all at once," said Claudia. "Maybe I better watch out for the Guinness record book."

"Well, you know, we all do this sort of thing together," Mary Anne told Claudia.

"You should read that book," I said. "I haven’t told you what we do. You should also go back and read the chapter on why the Brewers invented the Brewers, because there are a ton of good points there. And you should read all the comments. They tell us what to do better — to get back to business. You wouldn’t want to mess up the appointment, would you?"

"Good idea," said Mary Anne very generously. "Now tell me about the kids."

"Let’s get right to work," I went on to announce the meeting times.

We were all looking around the room for new clients. My name was on a waiting list for a new kid. And I was a new girl already. I had no idea what I had in store for.

In the end, I found out what had been going on with Claud and Abby before my very eyes. They’re the same age as my other best friend, Stacey McGill. Both of them are eleven, just like me. They’re in sixth grade and could easily be sent back in the seventh grade.

I did a lot of reading about how the Ramseys were involved in some sort of criminal instigation. And, despite the fact that I had no idea who those suspects were, I went through a whole book to find out who they were. I spent the rest of the summer at a local Middlebury book store, and the rest of the fall at Claudia’s. And I even made lists of my ideas for how girls could be better role models.

Anyway, on Monday I went to the Baba Sutra Center, the biggest school in Stoneybrook. It was packed. Claudia had just gotten her BSC acceptance letter when she came in. I was impressed. I hadn’t been so excited about sitting in the seventh grade class then. It turned out that the teachers had already told me about the Baba Sutra in the course book I’d been reading. I remember thinking to myself, “Wow. That must be some great stuff. I’d have loved it anyway.” I thought of all the good ideas I had about what to do with my life. I finally settled on a class of eighth-graders that day.

We headed into Claudia’s room, where Stacey was still sitting. I turned to Claudia. In that instant, everything changed. Stacey was angry. (I would have nothing against her.) “This is a new kid getting a hard time.” she complained. “This is a new problem.”

“This is a new problem,” Claudia replied.

I couldn’t believe what I said. I’d been hoping we’d be able to work this out, right? Let’s see, a little.

Stacey took a deep breath and shook her head. “Well, um, no one is pushing this issue forward. But, um, there are two students who don’t have the same problem. One of them has diabetes. The other has it.”

“So?” I repeated. “One of them has diabetes?”

“Well, one of them has diabetes, and the other has it.”

I looked at each of them. Then to Stacey I said, “Uh-oh. Um, tell everyone you have had a diabetic when you first started out.” (I wasn’t sure if we’d gotten on each other’s nerves.)

(Before I could say anything else about the teachers, Stacey’s expression softened. She looked at Claudia, who sat forward with a mischievous smile on her face.)

“Um, Kristy,” Claudia began, “maybe we should have just stayed in the seventh grade,” but before she could add another word to her answer, the phone rang. Claudia took that as a sign of fairness.

“Oh, my lord, this whole school is going to explode!<|endoftext|>
“Hey, Tigger, it’s me, Mary Anne. It’s me, really.” She called toward the door to the Stevenson Mansion, which is across the street from our Bat Mitzvah (Calvary).

Mary Anne paused, then said, “D
