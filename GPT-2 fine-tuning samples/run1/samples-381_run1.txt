 minutes. Anna shook her head. “I was just trying to do the Baby-sitters Club meeting again. I was having trouble on Tuesday. And I needed to talk to Kristy.”

“Kristy is great.” I said.

“You know what that means.”

“That’s true,” Kristy said, shaking her head. “She’s really helpful. You know,” she added wryly, “everything about the club is right. It works perfectly. And I’m glad I joined it because I’m good friends with all of the girls.”

“Good!” I laughed. “I mean, I wasn’t terribly awful —”

“But she couldn’t make it.”

“Then I did.<|endoftext|>
By the time we arrived at the Claudia Kishi family house, everyone was already there. But as I walked in the door, a smile plastered across my face. Claudia is the vice-president of the BSC. She visits me and every other Monday and Wednesday. She pays us dues, and at the end of the week she pays for our phone bill and for gas money for Charlie Thomas's family, which consists of Abby and her little brother. Abby also has a job with a small-business company in Stoneybrook, and soon after she grows up, they hire her mom.

Actually, Claudia is a pretty busy house. It was her duty — to give every last penny we could afford — to have a phone in the room by 5:30 on Mondays. That's when she visits me and Mary Anne and every other Monday and Wednesdays, when Abby is working on his ballet lessons.

The only other BSC member who doesn’t take a job is me, since the club was pretty small. Kristy is vice-president mainly because it’s her place to sit. She’s usually in my director chair, right where she usually sits with her hands on her hips, her hands on her hips, her face straight up.

I wasn’t surprised to spot her there when we first arrived on the Claudia Kishi lot. She’s so busy with her ballet classes. As you might imagine, she’s very busy. But there’s no one else who does anything else than takes lots of baby-sitting jobs, and that’s pretty awesome.

I glanced at Stacey McGill, who was sitting across from me now and then. She was the only one of us who had taken the bus to school that day, and she and Stacey have really come up with interesting ways to spend time together. One of them is art. Stacey’s an art fiend. She loves her paintings and drawings and she has these big long, red-brick wooden sculptures on which she paints, grays, and browns, and gives her jewelry. They’re really cool. (She even has a little bit of fashion going on.)

We stopped for a moment to admire Stacey’s figure. She’s on a little stage in front of us one day, wearing a little-girl uniform that runs around the body like a big purse. And that outfit has two holes pierced in each ear. Stacey is an only child. That’s unfortunate because her family is huge — she has eight kids, nine kids younger at home. Plus, her parents are divorced. Mrs. McGill died when Stacey was little. She was raised by my dad, who worked hard to make sure he had decent-sized families. Then I saw a miracle in his kids. He brought up three: a little girl from the cradle, and a big, fluffy dog from the wilds of Mars.

When it was time for the meeting to start, Stacey looked up from the sculpture. “Hello, hello, little ones!” she said. “Can you give me a short introduction?” She picked up the receiver of the phone, and called Mary Anne.

She listened for a little while longer, but then Stacey just started speaking, “Hi, my name is…. I just came here from a ballet performance. I came to see if, uh, Dawn could fix this.”

Mary Anne looked at the address in the information book. “That place is Stoneybrook Elementary?” she asked.

“No, but Mrs. Stevenson said she could fix it and we’d all do that.”

“Oh. Yeah. Mrs. Stevenson said she did.”

“Uh…. Yes, she’s going over there to buy some toys for my baby
