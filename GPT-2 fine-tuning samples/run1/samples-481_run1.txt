Claud was the BSC treasurer until her dad was fired the day before the meeting. So before Kristy left for Stamford I took over his job. I don't think anyone in the BSC would have minded if Mr. Thomas couldn't be reached to arrange for a certain sitter. The reason Kristy left was because Mr. Thomas left office for good reason. I guess one reason he did wasn't because of his job. He didn't want to make sure his friends, his two associate members (one is Mary Anne’s boyfriend, the other is Kristy’s other best friend), didn’t get to see junior members like Dawn Schafer and Mallory and Jessi. They’d have had their faces and noses pummeled with things that weren’t official summer appointments. And Kristy was left with a dilemma. She hoped that, just for the sake of balance, she could reach several people at once, since Kristy could consider holding an extra meeting whenever she wanted. But even though she hoped some people would be there in case of a disaster, it was only an emergency.

That’s how the BSC was formed: Kristy, Stacey, and a group of friends we’ve all known (mostly Mary Anne and one member of the BSC, Dawn) for the last six years.

The BSC was also my first real chance to prove otherwise. I convinced Mary Anne that if I began a day early and had time on my hands, I could make sure that as many people as possible were in my way when the meeting began. But as they arrived, a loud clunk, the news spread everywhere, and the BSC got underway.

For starters, everyone joined hands to make one huge, stupid, unexpected mistake.

The first one was my brother’s car accident just a few weeks earlier. Mary Anne’s mom and her good boyfriend called my house several times to set up jobs. They decided they’d only be doing their jobs if anyone was available.

That’s right. That’s how the BSC was formed.

It turned out that just because we don’t have a lot of regular clients, we’re still known to have them. So we decided to split up.

That turned out that even though we all worked really hard to bring the club to life, we were still not a single big family. That was because Mary Anne got to be the club president and that’s how the club was formed: Mary Anne, in charge, decides what’s in the club. Kristy and Stacey could not be as bossy as they were, either. At the moment, it sounds as though every problem is solved.

I’m glad that I was the club’s treasurer. But I’m glad that I was able to make the most of my time at the BSC. The school year is a blur, especially with new kids. With them come the new charges, new experiences, new ideas. So I couldn’t wait to see what could possibly happen.

For one thing, I needed a sitter for the Stoneybrook Junior Ballet practice. For another, there were six new charges on the sixth grade. I figured, why not just assign one number to each charge plus one for each kid I’d been on? I thought about that more. I decided it was more natural for us, since there might be only one available number for every kid. Plus, I didn’t have a lot of time. I had two days before the meeting started to count down my charges, but the phone rang and we didn’t have time to chat. That’s when I decided it was time to do something about the BSC. I dashed out the other end of the phone with the idea: how would we reach two new members before the summer semester ended? I asked myself questions about the club I’d been elected treasurer.

Sure enough, the phone interrupted me and I couldn’t move fast enough. It stopped ringing soon after 10:30. I had to tell Kristy that I’d call Kristy’s number back before she hung up. (That’s when I called Kristy on my summer job.)

Stacey had been waiting so long for the job. She’s usually the one to get a client’s phone calls when no one is available. She said it was time for a club meeting.

“I’ll call you right back,” Kristy said, reaching under her bed for a spring bag of potato flakes.

I hoped Kristy wouldn’t take the job. She’s the Queen of the Fall and
