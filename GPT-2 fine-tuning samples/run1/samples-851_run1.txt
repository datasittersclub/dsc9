 salad. I think he likes health food the way Mary Anne likes fashion. And Claudia thinks her parents are overprotective of her image.

Not everyone agreed with Claudia’s about what Claudia should eat or wear. Mary Anne’s a total junk food nut, but Mary Anne’s a nice person who respects her looks. She’s thin, has glasses and contacts, and braces herself.

However, the group was finally split up in three. Jeff, my favorite Southerner, was one of the first people to arrive. He picked up his backpack from the floor and began picking out the new clothes. Then he started to bring his stuff, along with his Kid-Kits. As he was filling up his carton with coloring books, toys, and coloring books, I could almost hear the others in the background talking on the phone. And it didn’t take long for Kristy upstairs to ask what Claud was doing.

“Have you got the M&M’s?” She looked at Kristy sternly.

“Oh, no!”

“I’ve got some new art supplies,” Kristy said, picking up the bag.

Kristy was already planning things, too. For example, the set of stickers and markers she’d painted on her shirt to mark the places where she would be sitting — on my sweater, for example. Kristy was going to make it a custom-art item. She’d painted it all over her shirt and would probably bemapled to use markers and/or red tape to mark the places where she’d be sitting (unless she really, really welled things like me. Like me sitting at a movie theater with fake collie noses, or with my earrings on my nose and fake pierced ears, or with weird junk food on my plate). I could always find a way around the poster board.

I thought of all the fun ideas I had when we were kids. Ideas for making our Kid-Kits last. Ideas for making Kid-Kit last.

I knew about all the other things I couldn’t think of. Kid-Kits were ideas for our Kid-Kits. Ideas for making Snack Pots last.

I knew about the junk food. I thought of the soda. I went to the snack place with my dad. I looked around the room and found Mom and Dad staring at each other. (When I think of it, it’s kind of like when someone walks into my room and sees a pack of Twinkies and hides them in a closet.)

I knew about my allergies. I thought of the Kit Kat commercials. I thought of the popcorn I’d bought that afternoon. And I came up with ideas for the Snack Pots a few after the fact, since my life depended on them.

I didn’t plan on them coming in handy making dinner — I was feeling more sophisticated than ever.<|endoftext|>
At five-thirty on a Wednesday and ready for Queen Elizabeth's meeting of the Baby-sitters Club, I was walking home, not far from Claudia Kishi, when a voice said, “Dawn, come and see. What’s the matter?”

“Who?” I repeated.

“Hello, Mrs. Masters.” (The woman was Claudia’s old address book. I didn’t want to have my sister looking up her own address book entries, so I replaced the record book with it.)

“Oh, hi,” I said. “Well, I see … your name works, haven’t you, honey? I know that the Mastersons love each other.” Mrs. Masters is an only child, like my dad. And, like most parents, she misses her old town.

“Yes, I see. Well … I guess … I’ll call you back within two hours,” I began.

The woman hung up the phone and turned toward me with a flourish, “Oh, no! I want this taken care of.”

“Okay, I’ll call you back.” Mrs. Masters handed back the phone.

“Done,” I said.

Mary Anne already had the record book open. “Hmmm … I guess … I’ll call her some more Thursday after at least.”

“Okay,” I offered.

We were halfway home between calls when I heard another voice say, “Claud, it’s okay to talk about art. We’ll talk about art at school later.” The doorbell rang again and that time someone
