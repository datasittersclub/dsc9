 secret.

I asked Claud about it.

"No," she said, "her parents said that Dawn’s allergies and her appearance in general are a problem for them. I told them that Dawn doesn’t give her enough attention and Dawn’s allergies aren’t a really big plus for her,”

"I’d have to ask her what her allergies are or why they are bad," Claud said.

I asked about Dawn, and she suggested that Dawn’s behavior might be more important than any of her allergies.

Just then, Dawn’s phone rang again. It was Dawn Schafer, the treasurer of the BSC. We were calling to request more money since she didn’t work. She said she knew Dawn had her number but we wanted Claud’s number since they do have about equal numbers.

"Mary Anne said that Mary Anne had an idea this afternoon and that it was to set up a job fair in her neighborhood," I explained.

"That sounds better than Dawn's idea, Mary Anne, so I thought it was more likely one day you and I could come up with a great idea," Claudia chimed in. "The fair will be held in the new building (new building, you get it!) and all of you will be required to participate in some very special functions."

I said I couldn’t tell Dawn how to do the job fair. I knew that she didn’t know how, but I was convinced Mary Anne just meant to make a few phone calls.

"I think I’d like a lot of these functions that will be offered when we begin the job fair," I told her. "The fair, after all, will be held in Stoneybrook and we will be required to come up with a terrific idea for what to do all at once."

"It would be great," Mary Anne said.

"Let’s do it together," the others said. They were still on the phone. It was the day I joined up the Baby-sitters Club.

I was the only BSC member who could take on the job fair responsibilities. At first, I thought it might be cool, but then you have to be the boss.

The first job fair in Stoneybrook was on Jan. 5, 1928. Claudia Kishi was president. Claudia was very experienced because as secretary, she is the most experienced in the club. In other words, she knows more than anybody else about our business. (Only Mary Anne knows our business, because it has been around a long time and she’s a baby-sitter on her own.) Claud’s other responsibility, as you might guess, is to collect dues from our clients and from our clients’ after school jobs. I called her the treasurer and gave her my best guess as to whether we should accept the job.<|endoftext|>
“I’ll check them out,” I told Claudia. Dawn took a look at us.

“Let’s take them,” said Stacey McGill, who also happened to be a club member.

She said, “We’re free to take a few of them. I’ll check.”

I told my friends about the job fair and began to plan my own afternoon at the BSC office. It was fun. I couldn’t wait until the next afternoon. I’d planned for it, but I had to get some friends on my team, mainly to see if I could be done.

Around noon on Tuesday, the first Monday in February, everyone would be here at four o’clock, and everyone would be free to do their jobs. So, in my usual manner, everyone was there. And since I knew I’d be free to take the job, I had to be available to take it.

I’d been thinking about it since we started the Baby-sitters Club. What would I do with myself if I lost all that work? Would I need to work to finish my BSC homework?

And so, I took the job. I needed some time for myself to figure it out. I looked at a sketch of an old baseball cap on my wall. I thought, how much time would it make to take a job like that?

“Aaaaaugh …” I muttered. Maybe we would have some more jobs!

We all cheered. We didn’t have much to celebrate.

I left my desk at four o’clock and sat down at a corner desk. I counted out all the numbers on my computer notebook. I started counting the numbers — eight, thirteen, thirteen — and finally came up with the idea I had on Friday afternoon:
