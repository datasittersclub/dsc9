 shorter and younger than Watson, and both have a great sense of humor. Watson is also a big listener, and Watson has a soft spot for books and movie scripts that he has to write, since most of us don't read enough, but she and her family do (especially Karen, who is thirteen). As a book reader, Watson is an absolute pleasure to read. I used to hate her, even though I think she does a good job of reading. Her first impression is, well, the same as mine. In Watson's example, I don't mean anything by the words. I love her. It's okay how I see her. But do I love her because she speaks French and she's a ballet dancer and she wears ballet.

I am one of the great friends in the club. Even now, I sit for some of the most talented people in our class. The members love it. A meeting is free for us every Wednesday, or the day after the meeting. And when people are going to visit their family, we'll be there for them. We're like family.

If you don't know me, you should. If you do, and if you love the club, I guarantee you'll love it to death. You'll feel relieved when people don't feel like spending any time with the BSC. You'll feel relieved when people don't think of anyone else as an associate. You'll feel relieved when people have pets and you don't look at a pet. And you'll feel relieved that the other people of the BSC don't have pets.

So the club is great. The members use the pool and the club record book as a treasury for their expenses. The records are not all inaudible. We use them. Also, we keep track of everybody's dues.

Our dues pay. They're our personal allowance, plus a small amount of money used for our club expenses such as books and supplies that we don't keep track of. We take each client's club dues, which we use to pay Mary Anne and Charlie to visit us, and give them to our treasurer, Charlie, and the rest of the club's dues to help cover our Kid-Kits.

Charlie's brother, John, and his wife, Sharon, have two kids, Jeff and Karen. They've both been raised by parents who don't want their kids to grow up too fast. (Mary Anne, Claudia, and me have three kids â€” Claudia lives with us, while us and her brother live in our BSC home in Stamford, Connecticut.)

Claudia and I don't like to spend a lot of time with our family because it means we can't care for our own pets or spend our money on things we have other family needs. As a parent, I think we're very caring and are always available to help out. But for the most part, we don't really eat meat, except for a handful of crackers an hour or something.

My brother is an absolute wild animal. His diet is pretty strict, even for a boy. His dad died when Claudia died of a heart attack. I would be totally out of options! Claudia's brother died in a car wreck when his dad was missing. He was just as strict as Claud's dad and still looks like I would be with my parents. Now we're not sure what to do with him, but as we know, he has two kids, Karen and Richard, and he lives with Dawn and David Michael (our only other brother and sister). The two kids are five and seven, so Dawn and David Michael spend most of their time with Claudia and the other triplets. Karen has her own separate bedroom, while Dawn, Jeff, and Mary Anne and Mary Anne and Michael sleep upstairs in my aunt's room.

As vice-president, I run the club and help keep it organized, so that everyone has the tools necessary to be in charge.

Charlie is terrific and quick. He plays softball, and he loves to make calls. He's such a player we don't know what he does.

Mary Anne and Claudia are talented ballet dancers. They're in their eighth grade; they're both in sixth. Claudia is Japanese-American. She grew up in New York City, but it's long ago, and she has moved back to California to begin her ballet days. (Before I knew Stacey, Mary Anne would have been here.) Mary Anne's family is pretty much the same, except for her mom, who has diabetes. It's not a problem, but it's kind of painful to watch. I can't watch her. She's so young and she's not even at school yet.

Claudia is a writer and illustrator. During the Vietnam War she was a junior in high school. Her family used to live on Long Island with her father and her mother. Her grandparents used to live in the Long Island area. So they had to be
