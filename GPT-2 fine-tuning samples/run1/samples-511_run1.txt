======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Mary and Dawn were worried that their friends might not be able to stay until sixth grade. So Dawn and Mal replaced them with eighth-graders and nine-year-old kids. (By then Stoneybrook was hopping, even though Stoneybrook is about as close to Stoneybrook as can be.) After Mal and the Mal kids, which was no fluke, took the same train every trip, they began to dream up their own schedules. Mal's dream was to play violin in a orchestra when she grows up. And my dream was to become a professional musician at a professional playing contest at the local school.

"Well, no problem that night," Claudia wrote over the noise in the club notebook. "My mom and I are busy trying to figure out who should take Emily Michelle because she has a stage name we can't find in any college languages book. ... Then we have to figure out who should have our dance lessons. And I haven't gotten around to Nicky even though I know he's cute. I mean, I've watched Nicky practice and he's a lot more complicated than everybody thinks. He's very handsome."

There. Now you know what the BSC was all about, and the club was about the club too. Simple, no?

Simple that was, because we were pretty busy with our club. That was what makes us successful, right up until we had our first baby, the girl next door. (That's Stacey, our first BSC member, too.) As I said, Jessi was busy trying to find a good sitter for the twins she and Mallory, her best friend, would date. So while we were busy trying to line up even more baby-sitters, another club issue popped into the BSC, the club notebook. Yes, it takes one of us to get the most out of the BSC and to develop other coping strategies, especially when it comes to dealing with the unexpected.

In the notebook, Kristy (and Mary Anne Spier, our other best friend) are kind of the opposites in the BSC. They both like to talk about boys and they make up opinions on a regular basis. But Mary Anne is the shyest of them — quiet, shy, also very sensitive. Kristy is shy and sensitive (or at least, quiet as in sensitive) and can speak with a very high pitch in her voice. Neither of them is a fan of boys, either.

Kristy hates girls, not least because she's an only child and lives with her dad (and brother in high school). For a long time, her family lived in Stoneybrook — except for the time it took Kristy to David Michael University, where she was recently divorced. And in the fall of last year her mother married a man who now lives in the neighborhood where Kristy's father once lived. He was divorced — married again — and Mrs. Schafer moved in with Kristy's father. (Mrs. Schafer has four children from her previous marriage — two younger ones, an uni and a puppy, and a kitten named Tigger; and a grandmother, a kitten named Misty; and a dog named Boo-Boo.)

So, when Kristy found out that her mother and father had been high school sweethearts, she did a lot of soul-searching. She interviewed the parents, met with her two older brothers, and ended up with Watson Brewer, an associate BSC member who is also a regular flier. That's no ordinary flier. It's just a regular flier, I guess. Watson's not exactly famous, but he's one of the nicest, easiest people I've ever known. He'd probably love to meet his biological father, and he was certainly in touch with his mother and her two older brothers. Plus he has a girlfriend, who lives in California.

That's about it. Now let me describe what Kristy has been like since we met each other. She's very smart. And also, very beautiful, with perfect skin and the longest, reddest hair. What her mother doesn't have in common with her father; in other words, what her father did not do with her mother; or what her mother does with him; or what father and son they become simply by their relationships. Kristy's mother was totally destroyed by her father. He was driven crazy by her daughter. Mrs. Thomas had to work hard to make Kristy's life easier, and she finally convinced her best friend, Mary Anne, to get a baby-sitting job, and convince Kristy to move back to New Jersey.

When the move came, Kristy knew that moving wasn't the way to go. She had such a tough time adjusting to her new home that she was devastated when she first moved here, first with her mother, and later with her father. Her new home, her father, wasn't thrilled about the separation — even
