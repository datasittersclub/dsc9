 have made some of their own cookies.)

"Mary Anne," Abby announced, pulling one of the marshmallows out from under her pillow. "These are M&M's’s instead of chocolate.”

Mary Anne had the most perfect idea of all of us. “Mallory’s doing well,” she said, rolling her eyes at the M&M’s and tossing them to Mary Anne.

Mary Anne and Abby are best friends, and they’ve had things going for them. Mostly, that’s the way they are. Mary Anne, by the way, is about her size and she has pale blonde hair. She goes to Stoneybrook Middle School, which is the second-largest public school in Connecticut. Mary Anne’s mother died when she was a baby, so her dad raised her all by himself.

When Mr. Spier and Mrs. Schafer met each other, they got pretty close. Mary Anne was still a little bit young when they first became stepsisters (we are still only kids), but she and Mary Anne became friends now.

Abby is our alternate member. She can take over the job if she’s absent. That might sound odd, but it just means that Abby can take over when Abby’s job comes up.

I wonder if this is a problem, though. Although, as I mentioned, Abby is an identical twin. She and her sister, Anna, are identical, though they are not identical twins. They are the same in kind, because Abby has dark brown hair and Anna has dark brown eyes.

Abby lives with her mother and her father, to help take care of them while Abby and Anna care for themselves.

As our club secretary, I keep a record book, which contains the names, phone numbers, allergies, food preferences, and other information about our clients. It might as well be a law book.

Then, on days when Abby can’t make a meeting, I schedule a sitting job, which usually takes less than an hour. (Abby, by the way, is a triplets.)

This is a big help.

Now Abby can write in the book, and she can read Nancy Drew books, and she can make good grades in algebra and art class.

Abby is the BSC treasurer. She keeps the money we use for expenses, and provides us with a reward for helping out our clients.

When the phone rings, we sit down to wait for Mallory Pike to call the car. “Baby-sitters Club.” (Mal is the president.)

“Well, Kristy’s club is almost finished,” Kristy announced. Dawn looked up to Claud, and it turned out that Mal was right about Mal and the club in general.

I was pretty sure she was kidding, but I thought it would be a long ride.<|endoftext|>
“Dawn,” Mrs. Thomas said, holding up a manila envelope, “there’s some money in there.” (That’s how Mal and Kristy refer to her family.)

“Ow,” Kristy thought as she stared at the contents of the envelope.

“What are those?” Claudia asked.

“Ding! Ding! Ding!” Claudia clapped her hands together. She was starting to think, “Maybe I better have a go at keeping track of my money.”

Before anyone could ask her, the car driver picked up the money and turned down the radio, honking the horn to let the entire passenger-side phone in on what was happening.

“Hello! Are you here from school?” he asked.

“Quarterpipe,” Mary Anne answered, handing the envelope over. She sounded awfully polite. “Well, I’m home from work, and my parents are going out tonight. My mother-and-father-and-and-my-father-and-my-new-best friend-Charlotte have spent a whole lot of time talking about me and my work today.”

“Oh my lord,” Abby exclaimed. “There! I’ve spent a half hour talking about that!”

Abby was shaking her head. She hadn’t even made the required seven passes. She looked like a ballerina, except she had a bow and a dancer’s hand embroidering the middle of her leg.

“Uh-oh,” Kristy said.

“No, no, no.” Claudia sounded as if she might faint, and the rest of the club members gave her a
