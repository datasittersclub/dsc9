s that she and I sometimes get along really well, even though I’m not Mary Anne Spier’s type. Mary Anne has brown eyes, sort of reddish-brown hair, and is a very casual dresser. And, for some reason, Mary Anne has no trouble getting along with other eighth-grade girls, either. (But not with her.)

The club’s president holds Claud’s hand as she makes her way to her appointment in the secretary’s chair. ( Mary Anne always sits with one of her own.) She is the one who set the rules for the job. One day, maybe soon, she’ll need a sitter for a group of four or so at one of Claud’s many activities — I like to teach English at Stoneybrook Middle School. Mrs. Schafer had invented the club, and she’s a good leader and organized person. Claud had the perfect character, no matter what other people think of her.

Dawn and I were at that meeting, and we were in trouble. Actually, what we really felt was the same what with Mr. Spier. We became concerned when we first met him, but we let him go. We all feel weird about him, mostly because he acts strange, as I have written, but also because he’s a little uncomfortable in a leather jacket, with a short haircut, and with all the cool stuff that goes on with every outfit.

How does he handle everything that comes his way? Lately he’s been practicing with me. He has a client — a girl named Dawn — with a secret love. The princely sum total of “in” comes out of the beginning of the relationship. She saves money by staying at Mr. Schafer’s house for a time. But then something unexpected happens to the princely amount of money … Mr. Spier and Mrs. Schafer get divorced. The divorced couple lives in California again, and the Spiers stay in Stoneybrook. I’m not sure if this is romantic or not, but it definitely would have been a better arrangement. The divorced couple moved into the Schafers’ house not long after Dawn’s wedding.

This is how it all works out: Mrs. Schafer and Mr. Spier get a half share of the house and half of Dawn’s house. They give each child a part of each birthday.

Dawn is the club’s alternate officer. She steps in whenever a regular officer is called up for a job. Since we meet in Claudia’s room, she can take over the job of anyone who might be absent. Dawn also has special duties during meetings. For instance, she’s responsible for answering the phone at the club meeting, checking the books on the night shift, and so on. She also keeps a club record book with namesakes we can call to take the job of anyone who’s absent.

Dawn is our California girl of the year. And, although most of us are called Skittles, we have two other associate members. They don’t usually come to meetings but are on standby when we need extra help.

Kristy called the meeting to order, as usual. The phone rang again, this time on Claudia’s part, and I got a message purring of Frook from somewhere.

“This meeting is about to begin,” I said. “Claudia, this is Mary Anne. I’m coming to the meeting.”

“Cool,” Claudia said, taking the receiver. “I’ve got a new client. He has some new sisters and brothers in the neighborhood.”

“Really? What …?” Kristy asked.

“Well, I have a new sister, a younger sister, and a baby brother. They’re from Mexico.”

“You mean, they came from Mexico?” Kristy asked.

“Oh, no. They came from Mexico from Mexico between my father’s house and Watson’s,” Claudia replied.

Oh. So there’s a place to put the Squirt (“murderer of the trippy) and a place to make it Squirt. Now Kristy’s trying to balance things.

I sighed. “I’ll have to go back to the club to find out what happened,” I told Mary Anne, who had arrived just in time.

“What?” Claudia asked.

“I’m going away,” I said.

“You want to go back to the club?” Claudia asked.
