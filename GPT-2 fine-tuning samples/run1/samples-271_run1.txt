 Hobt’s house, and I love to sit for her. (She is our alternate officer.)

I sat cross-legged in Claud’s director’s chair, looking at this gorgeous girl. Mary Anne’s picture was hanging on a wall at my table. I could see the girl wearing a big white star in her eyes, a star in a blue sky, above the stars.

You’d never guess that Mary Anne is Jewish. When my parents married, she moved with her family to Kristy’s house. In spite of having no pets, they were convinced Mary Anne’s family would be healthier and happier if we were healthy. She’d decided they’d want all their pets to be kept out of their sight and ears, to be kept away from toys and games and on the floor, to be blindfolded, and even to wear glasses with contacts if they did get creased.

But she’d chosen healthy and happy homes — the BSC, Claud’s, and the neighborhood. She is one of the world’s most creative people.

If I had to pick a favorite memory of Kristy or Jessi, it’s if they were in a romantic relationship, or if I didn’t notice, until I fell in love — one night — with a California guy named Fowler, and they got to see who was in love with whom.

We watched it all happen — how they got married, whether or not they’d ever expect to be together. We watched a couple of weeks — my life, by the way — go by as my parents let go of their duties to try to care for me.

“So, what do we do?” asked Kristy. “Move to California?” I nodded.

“The world’s a better place now,” said Jessi.

“You don’t know.” I replied. “We don’t have to,” I added, waving the red and blue plastic sign out front.

Kristy nodded.

“We’ll go,” I said again. “We should call Shannon. She can be’t wait.”

Shannon didn’t show up at my table because she’d already left. It would have been more convenient for me to catch her when I went out with Mallory, Jessi, and Marnie at the Burnt Oak Mall, which was next door to Stacey’s house.

Shannon and Mallory moved into Stacey’s old house, which was next door to our old one. Mallory and Stacey both live in New York City. Jessi moved to Stoneybrook from Long Island (now part of Jersey). And Shannon, the BSC’s newest member, moved back to Stoneybrook after Mal finished high school. (Not to take her job with the BSC seriously.)

I was glad to see that Jessi had started the BSC. No wonder she’s such a cool person. Jessi’s really pretty. She’s the oldest baby in her family, and she still has the longest, blonde hair she’s ever seen. Plus, she has two younger brothers (Sam and David Michael), and she and Jessi are the only members of the BSC who actually eat nuts. This is kind of a complicated description, but in the end it reflects the fact that Jessi is an amazing creative person. She even drew the clothes everyone at the BSC was wearing in the photo we all had.

Shannon moved into her old house — which is across town from Claudia’s — after Mal finished high school. She’d been moving around a lot lately, I think, because she got her ears pierced. (Another thing about our room. We have a different club than the one Mrs. Barrett had.) She moved into her old house, which just happens to have a private phone line. Also she and her new family had an extra large dog (she’d been playing with her brother, David Michael) that was named Tigger (Jessi liked the nickname Tigger).

Jessi has dark brown eyes and reddish-brown skin and has brown hair (she’s Japanese-American). She’s a ballerina, so she loves to run and jump. (She wants to be an artist. She wants to be a writer.) Jessi is also an associate member. We call her that if we have a meeting that time, and she works overtime getting calls at the BSC.

Jessi’s mother has diabetes, which means her body doesn’t make the right amount of insulin. (Her
