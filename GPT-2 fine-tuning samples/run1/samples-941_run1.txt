y-type style. Mary Anne’s hair is long, pale, wavy, and jet-black. Dawn’s skin is clear, pale pink, and freckled.

Our treasurer is Stacey McGill. Like Mary Anne and me, Stacey is pretty and bubbly. But she’s an idea person. I think that’s why she keeps track of things and runs the treasury as efficiently as a grown-up super-organ. Stacey is also very generous. She pays dues (every Monday, without fail), and we use the money to buy supplies for our Kid-Kits, which are boxes of toys and games (mostly hand-me-downs). We also keep a reserve in the treasury for our Baby-sitters Club, which is a bunch of fun stuff that we bring on jobs with hold groups. We pay dues to Stacey every Monday (and always have a good amount left over), and she pays Kristy and the entire club dues the next Monday. That way, we can really be contributing to the BSC and helping out our charges!

And there you have them! A club full of highly efficient people!

I almost forgot about Dawn, Jessi’s sister! She had been coming to meetings and taking over after I left. Unfortunately, she didn’t come to meetings. (Some of the people I talked to today said they had trouble seeing Dawn outside of her appointment announcements and are now convinced she doesn’t live in their town.)

This made me even more nervous. But once I came home, my breath caught and I felt like crying. As soon as I lay down on my stomach, I felt a weight on my room rug lift. I knew she was something else, but that didn’t surprise me. Dawn is a wild person, and it was hard to believe that I’d seen her cry at a Baby-sitters Club meeting that day. That was when I learned that she’d tried not to be petrified by her own sister, Janine the Physician.

What would I do if I woke up one morning in that dream — to my room, holding a bottle of poison, and immediately falling to the floor?

That was what Stacey did. She put her hands on her hips and said, “I am a member of the Baby-sitters Club. Any new business?”

I couldn’t believe my luck. A sign at the door read, “New clients, call us now.” That was exactly right. Calls came in, and soon we had more meetings than we could handle.

When Stacey left, we replaced her with Jessi (who had come to sitting for the twins). That was when Mary Anne joined the club. Then Dawn joined it, too. We all stayed in the club until we moved to Stoneybrook this year. But already there have been new members.

It didn’t take long to count out Mrs. Kishi and tell her we’re moving because of Dawn. So now the most dynamic job comes to the club from time to time. Claudia, Stacey, and me aren’t in any trouble because of Dawn — her sister, Janine, lives with us. But since Stacey’s a math whiz, everybody else is, and math whores are not exactly hot. Stacey’s so smart, too. She’s really good, but it doesn’t matter that much if she wants to be cool and dress cool and look cool. Stacey doesn’t want to advertise anything because she’s cool (which doesn’t happen much except that people notice).

Of course, everybody had one big job to do on Monday. Whoever it was (Dawn!) ran the business, making sure everyone got done before the meeting started.

(I missed something when I looked in on the clock. It was now almost five-thirty.)

As soon as Stacey was in the room, I knew we had to do something. I didn’t want anyone thinking that we could’t possibly have no-one in the BSC at all times.

I set up the BSC record book. That’s Stacey’s great idea. It lists everything we do on that page — names of our regular clients, addresses, phone numbers, rates paid, and important details such as how many kids we baby-sit for. I found that it really organized the records we had. Stacey didn’t have a problem with club job requests, although she did have to deal with the inconvenient fact that some of her former clients hadn’t been able to sit for us when we first started the club.

Then I saw Kristy start my homework at the
