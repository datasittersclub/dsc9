 sad and hurtful that it took Jeff to find me, and now I miss him terribly. I feel sad every time I see him sad, but I don’t try to be sad.

I was the only one here to see the Jeffs that Friday night. I held them still for an eternity, waiting for somebody to call. I just couldn’t resist. I looked up at the others in the room. Jeff was a pretty boy, but he never cared much about clothes, and he was wearing these long navy-blue shorts, a tight black corset, and high-top overalls.

That’s how Dawn and Mary Anne and I meet and stay friends.

Anyway, back to our meeting.

Mary Anne and I entered the meeting breathlessly, while Abby looked up as she took off her top and shook out her hair.

“That’s right, Kristy, it is.” Mary Anne pointed to the date.

Kristy nodded. “The Monday after the wedding, Mrs. Schafer and I went to the same kind of place one time and got married. That — that really neat place we lived in.”

All the members looked at one another with the smile on their faces. It was fantastic!

We couldn’t believe it!

The wedding was already underway.

Kristy’s parents had gotten divorced, and now Mrs. Schafer and Mr. Spier had decided to take a bigger step. They bought lots of new homes, got married, had kids all by themselves, and then came up with one of the craziest ideas of all time.

“Wait a minute. The wedding started now!” Mary Anne was saying, looking at me in surprise. That made me feel warm inside. It wasn’t that Mrs. Spier’s house wasn’t big yet, but it was just so huge. It was huge in that old house — that old farmhouse on Burnt Hill Road — where all the old girls lived! (Mrs. Schafer had fallen in love with the old housekeeper and has been happily married to Watson ever since.)

“Here we are! That was it!” Kristy exclaimed.

“Wow.”<|endoftext|>
I was the first downtown reader to turn to Claudia Kishi. Her gorgeous, two-and-a-half-year-old Vietnamese puppy are such a hit with the kids we sit at our school. They smell delightful, too, since the Kishis moved into the old farmhouse.

Kristy Thomas is the only member of the BSC who doesn’t always like Claudia’s junk food. Kristy isn’t a snob (she has a secret pass — she has a big desk and these huge, velvet-covered big brown notebooks), and I think that’s one of the differences between Kristy and Claudia, which is that she’s very self-conscious about her junk food. But I’m glad I found this BSC notebook. The fact that Kristy has lots of junk food means we don’t, for a second, soundlessly ate our lunches. I’m glad we didn’t because the worst part is that we’re the only eleven-year-olds in the school. Second-grader kids can’t eat junk food and Kristy didn’t think it was right for them.

Kristy and I are both in the sixth grade, though. I’m just as funny-looking, and I like being the oldest dog in the family. Kristy and I have always looked different, but we’re pretty alike, too. We’re both small, like Kristy, and we look a little alike, too. Kristy has brown eyes and freckles, so I do not look like my average, sort-of-jock. We’re both short — Kristy is a junior at Stoneybrook Day School, in Connecticut — and we both have brown hair and brown eyes. (Kristy’s hair is blonde, while Mary Anne’s is blue-eyed and athletic.) And we both love to read, especially about children (we’ve even read Nancy Drew mysteries!).

There, then, I stood. Sitting in my director’s chair, waiting for Claudia to phone me. “Boy,” I said, “did anyone say ‘boo?’?<|endoftext|>
“It’s Valentine’s day!” Claudia Kishi had called from a shopping trip to Connecticut.

I had just run out of treats — candy, nail polish, and a few pieces of
