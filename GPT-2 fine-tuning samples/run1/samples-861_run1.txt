 fact. And you know what I love about this movie? Hearing her say good-bye to the audience.

As you can see, I was loving the story. It was not easy to watch Jackie be Jackie again. And when I read it one day, I thought Jackie and Jackie Robinson were identical twins. Who were Jackie and Robinson like? And why did they have to make special parents check on each other every night?

But I like mysteries, so mysteries are good for me. Plus, mysteries are also good at having suspenseful endings.

The first book I ever picked up was The Case of the Disappeared Child. That was in the colonial period. The story was called Mrs. Addisons Black's diary. That's when the adults at the local police station discovered that Jackie and Jackie's grandmother Nannie Black had not only moved to their new community, they had also moved back in with the family, never to see Mrs. Addisons again.

So I read the book one hundred and ninety-nine times and had to write it down in a special notebook for myself. That's how I feel about mysteries.

And when I picked up my new love for mysteries, I was very humongous. If I had my way, I'd be dead serious.

Guess what.

I picked up my favorite subject.

What if my grandmother's mother had stayed in Stoneybrook?

And what if my grandmother's father had been in Stoneybrook?

I went into the record book and looked for my best friend.

But wait! I needed to speak with someone first.

There was nothing I could do about that. That was because I didn't have a perfectly good eye exam.

The Doctor sat by my desk and I took care of my work.

I was sure Mr. Ramsey would figure it out.

The Doctor looked around the room and announced, "This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club is hereby adjourned."

I looked at Mrs. Papadakis, which meant that she was now free for some business. But I didn't care. I just wanted to talk to the other girls.

"What were you talking about?" asked Stacey McGill, who is my best friend and who has blonde hair and dark eyes and velvety blue the way I like to talk about boys. "I can't tell you what."

"What?" said Stacey, turning pale. "Were you going to replace Deanna with any other guy?"

"I was going to replace Dawn," I told her. "I just received the best news today."

"Why?" asked Kristy. "It's good to have someone who's used to being a boyfriend available."

"Good news and bad news," said Stacey. "What was the bad news?"

"First, someone new has to be replaced."

"Good news," said Stacey to Kristy. "Then someone else comes along and it's better not to replace Dawn."

"Good news," said Claudia, giving us both the bad news.

"Good news and bad news," said Mary Anne to Kristy.

"Then someone else comes along, and it's better not to replace Mary Anne either. She's got a new boyfriend."

"Who?" said Stacey. "I'm sorry, I'm late."

"Good-bye, good news. I'll see you at your meeting then." I hung up.

I could feel myself grinning. Claudia gave a disgusted gasp at the doorbell. Mary Anne sprang to her feet.

"Sorry, I couldn't make it this far." She went down the stairs with Stacey, Claudia, and I.

Everyone cracked up.

Claudia sighed. "I'll do it. I love it."

I sighed a little. "I did my homework, all in English class. Then I took my classes back to New York. And then I went back to England. I was worried about my studying habits."

"You weren't worried about studying habits," Mary Anne said. She sighed again. I could swear she felt guilty about letting Dawn go.

"Mary Anne, that's okay," I said coolly. I'd heard enough about Richard not to worry about what Mary Anne had planned for him â€” activities, you know, like art. I'd hoped that, since Dawn had threatened to quit me. But when I'd expected something more, something more uncomfortable.

I felt like crying silently. Just as I dug the door shut behind me, I heard a terrific crash and then another. I nearly tumbled over. My backpack snapped under me, and I landed facefirst on my head as heavy clouds of dust streaked across the room. I ducked my head to try to keep from falling. Luckily
