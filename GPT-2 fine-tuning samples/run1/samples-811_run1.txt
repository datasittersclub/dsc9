 teacher of a sport club), and that she has a little sister named Becca (she’s seven). They’re also friends. I think they’re pretty cute.

Claud’s best friend in the BSC is Stacey. They’ve known each other since they were babies. Back in ancient times, they even dressed alike — which was a good thing for Claudia, since she looked twelve when her older brothers were born. Plus, Stacey used to wear all chinoos, which she probably did when she was younger. But now though they’re in their early twenties, they both stick together as a BSC family. Stacey has a healthy passion for music and dance, while Claud keeps her close personal diary: details about her bed-and-breakfast job, how it went, and so on. Stacey likes sports and junk food, very much, and loves to read Nancy Drew books (she loves to read them, too, even though the books are way offbeat!).

Speaking of Nancy Drew, what a bunch of junk food tastes like! Stacey doesn’t eat sweets, but when she does she’s never a slob like I! She’s a fabulous dancer who loves all things ballet. And as hostess of one of the original daytime daytime TV shows, Stacey kept the BSC record book in order and up-to-date when clients needed her. It’s one of my all-time favorite things, and I love that Abby is also great at it.

As BSC secretary, Jessi Ramsey handles most of the official records. She has pale skin, bangs, and shoulder length brown hair, and I like that she’s not a sporty girl. But Jessi holds herself with elegance and coolness, and that brings me back to Mr. and Mrs Ramsey, who have been my brothers and sisters longest-held grannies.

In all honesty, Jessi would be an excellent secretary, since she’s so original and unique. She is also the world’s biggest collie, with the deepest, deepest brown eyes. (Jessi usually wears cat-up clothing, but I wouldn’t have it worse than that.) She’s also lucky to be as healthiest as Jessi is hair and hair-length blonde; her whole family has cat-marries now! She has one younger sister, Claire, plus Claire has diabetes (which means her body can’t control the level of sugar in her blood), so she has to give herself injections of insulin and monitor her blood sugar. This is a breeze for someone with this much sugar in her bloodstream.

Even though Jessi is a snob, she takes it seriously. She doesn’t mind sharing junk food with me, though. I think boys can tell girls’s ears from boys’ ears.

As BSC secretary, Mallory Pike keeps the record book in order. She’s the only one of us to have her own bedroom, of course. Which is lucky, because Mal’s room is really big. There are also her notebook, which is kind of a mystery, because on it there is also the paper trail, which is what we call the BSC notebook.

Mallory is as quirky and varied a person as you can imagine. She goes to private school. She’s always making dumb luck happen. In fact, she’s one of the original members of the BSC. (Who are her initials? Stacey. Shannon. Shannon?) She’s an associate member of the BSC. That means she doesn’t come to meetings, but she is ready to fill in if somebody has an idea that we really like, or if there’s a problem. That kind of person knows how to make us laugh. She’s hilarious. It’s lucky to have Mallory. She’s one of the best horse impersonators in all of Stoneybrook.

I almost thought that, at the meeting, when everyone else was saying “Claudia, you look fantastic.” I was telling my friends Claudia and Mary Anne that I was really impressed. That afternoon, Mallory is usually busy with her art project, but today she was in my ensemble — I’d only called it so it didn’t sound like I’d made somebody up. I always take that description with a pinch of salt, but that didn’t stop Mallory from telling us about her incredible schoolwork.

Mary Anne and I went into her room and locked eyes until the lights came on. Mal and Jessi were sitting on the bed, Jessi on her stomach, Mal looking on the bed, and Kristy and Dawn all frisking over the tops of their shoe boxes.
