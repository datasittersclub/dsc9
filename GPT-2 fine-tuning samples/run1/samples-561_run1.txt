As if that weren't weird enough, Shannon’s father — who is also an executive editor for a major publishing house — was the one who brought Shannon up and kept it in line. Shannon is so incredibly smart and very athletic. She is also great at languages. When Shannon is feeling incredibly proud, she goes to a California school or to an English college, and she is always smiling and wave after wave explaining how they invented the languages.

Shannon says she’s also the oldest among her group of eleven. But she is so bolder than most older members. "I'm not old to ask for help with a problem," she will tell you. But not old enough to ask for help with a new problem.

Mimi also has plenty of courage when it comes to dealing with Claudia’s problem. She’s Japanese-American, and her parents aren’t exactly great about bringing her up (she gets diabetes only because she was born on the day her parents gave birth to her new, rare blood disorder). But Mimi has done nothing but help. She and Claudia have been a bit more than a couple lately, but things are adjusting.

Mary Elizabeth and Stacey are, in fact, the two most difficult members of the BSC. Like Stacey, they adore reading the Bible. I think this is mostly because they are pretty different. They’re not quite as different as the way Stacey dresses or think about life. They both dress like model babies. But Stacey can definitely see that she’s beautiful, and she has huge blue eyes — the look that could make a top model’s head spin.

Stacey has a little more energy, but on balance, she’s as gorgeous as Claud or I. She’s got the most energy (and the clothes), but I suppose there’s also the side of beauty I just described.

Stacey’s parents are divorced. She lives with her mom in New York, where she looks as stunning as Stacey does. There is one other thing about Stacey — she has diabetes. That’s a disease in which her body doesn’t process fat properly (that’s a disease not unlike what happens when your body doesn’t process sugar properly). So Stacey has to take very strict medication every single day. Stacey is also very much by herself. She is very shy and very outspoken (she even got pierced twice in her right eye).

Stacey has the hardest job in the BSC. She is club vice-president. Her main function is to spread the club news and to keep track of client appointments. She’s also in charge of hospitality. This is the hospitality section of the club. Stacey is very good at making sure I feel welcome. She makes sure I have lots of snacks for when I’m going away. She brings a Snack Brewer for dinner on special occasions, per the honor system. And she brings some trail-blazing BSC ingredients — Dawn Schafer’s protein powder, MCT oil, dill pickle seeds, paprika, and pepperoni spice, tots, granola bars, and sometimes chocolate.

In case you hadn’t guessed, our officers are also “regular members.” Most of them are newbies to the BSC (the ones who joined not long ago are Stacey and Mary Anne). But they’re still close enough to be trusted with our jobs. And we hardly ever have to advertise.

Our newest member, Jessi Ramsey, also happens to be our newest member. In fact, right before we became BSC officers, she was about to join us — as an associate member. Like Dawn and Mal, Jessi is a newcomer to Stoneybrook — but she didn’t have to audition when she did. She just grew used to our age group.

The fact that Jessi and her sister, Emily Michelle, moved across town to join us after both of Jessi’s parents had left the club prompted them to move back together, too. Jessi was really, really sad about that, and I was glad she’d come back. The other members of the BSC don’t come to great meetings. They’re like babies. I guess it’s because they’re older than the rest of them. Jessi is shorter than Mal, who is six feet tall and is a talented ballet dancer. And Jessi doesn’t seem to mind that the opposite of Kristy — sort of smart —’s Kristy —’s Jessi.

Mary Anne Spier is our club’s secretary. Her most recent assignment is solving mystery solved mysteries. As we were switching clubs, she called to tell me about the Milk Duds Club, and
