======== SAMPLE 1 ========
s, Mr. Thomas, and Mrs. Thomas and Mr. and Mrs. Thomas, and Mrs. Thomas came from many different backgrounds, some of them very different. I've already said that Mr. Thomas, since he came to Stoneybrook from Louisville, Kentucky (the other ones are not part of the study here!) comes from a large family — his mother, sisters, and kids all live in my house, too. But Mr. Thomas always made me sit where he wanted me to, on my own bed. I did it, too, and he also made me use my own room (as many of us do).

I couldn't be more confused for a puppy after he flopped on the floor.

We were sitting for the second time with a few other math problems. Mr. Thomas was taking one of his pencils off after he'd looked it up in the notebook he'd been having at school. (He knows that's where he belongs.) Suddenly, a sharp look came over me, in the notebook. “No problem,” he said, taking off the pencil. “” Stacey McGill came over. “” I could see the pencil was missing, and she looked at him cautiously with a confused expression on her face. “Don’t worry,” she said, “” “how’s it supposed to be?”

“It’s fine. My math classes are all fine,” I whispered to myself. “But then,” I added, “how did you learn to read,”

“You’re right,” answered Mr. Thomas confidently. “And that’ll be a little too scientific, right?”

“Sure!” interrupted Mrs. Thomas. “We’ve been learning it,” she said. “And all we’re doing is repeating math in our homework.” She put the notebook aside. She flipped to the pages of the notebook and started writing in it. “How did you learn to read,” she asked, “and” and “how did you come up with these terrific —” She paused. “Why are you all writing in the notebook now?”

Mr. Thomas shook his head. “You know, I’d like to look at it and see if I’re right.”

“Right,” my heart began to beat faster. “Oh, no.” I said. “”

“No, just leave it at that.” Mrs. Thomas put her left hand over my shoulder. “How did you learn to read,” she asked.

“Well, what about you?” I replied. “”

“I’ve been having trouble answering.” Mrs. Thomas reached under the bed and pulled out a book. “If there’s something wrong, don’t be alarmed —” She placed the book aside and flipped to page after page. “Now, how do you learn to read and write,” she asked, “and to remember to read a book every day?” When she said this and left the book at the same time, she closed the notebook and began writing. She wrote in it, on the back of the book. The book came to life — in my handwriting.

Just then, the doorbell rang. “Hi, Mrs. Spier. My name is Mr. Spiers. I’m the vice-president of the BSC and I’d like to take this last call with you on Monday afternoon.”

“Oh, hello. Mrs. Spier, uh,” said the first name in my book, not “that hard. Oh, I’d like to speak to you about this.” The other names — Bart and Mary Anne — were taken aside as well, by everybody.

Mr. Spier was there, but not quite as soon as I had spoken with him. Then the phone clicked again. “Hey, come in. Sit by to-call you.”

“Okay.” I said. “Hello.” I hung up the phone on the porch and waited for Mr. Spier. When I hung up, I heard him groan, “Oh, hi, that’s Mrs. Spier, thanks a lot. I don’t know what you’re going to do for dinner.”

“No!” cried Mr. Spier, holding up the phone. He put his hand on the door handle and said, �
