 real? In fact, Kristy is a bit of a stir-crazy person on a baseball team.

Kristy has not only a good family life. She has two nieces and nephews, a stepsister and a stepbrother, an aunt and uncle, an aunt and a nieces and nephew, and a great-grandmother. But she also has seven younger sisters, including a twin sister, a baby-sitter, and two brothers, one sister, and a sister.

Kristy also has seven older brothers and sisters. But you never know what's in store for them. If they all have a little sister, who would be happy? What if they each goes on to be friends? And what if they both have something good to look forward to with their mother and dad?

That's what the BSC is all about. We love kids and have a lot of fun with them, but also we have two things I've learned not to do with kids lately — make ourselves. The first is make dinner. That's how Kristy's mom organized the BSC for Christmas. That's also why she gave us some very cool gift ideas. And that's why she's so happy we're making this baby-sitting zoo.

Kristy's family moved from up in Stoneybrook, which is where she grew up. And they moved home from school. When Kristy's mom married Watson Brewer, it was her idea to have a family at Kristy's house. That's when her dad started to figure out what his kids would be like, and he was able to find someone he liked.

And that's Kristy.

So I guess it's a good thing she has such a great family. She has to. But she does. And, when she does have family problems, it usually comes first. Which is why she's our club treasurer. Kristy's mom, Mary Anne Spier, has a great job.

For a while, Kristy lived on the other end of the Bradford Court, and at that time Mrs. Spier had two kids — and now she has two kids. Jessi and her twin sister, Whitney, moved to Stoneybrook from New Jersey recently. Jessi's family is pretty big, so Jessi and her mom adopted a whole new stepbrother, Ryan. They don't need a father to live with them anymore anymore, which means mom and Watson can bring their kids on their visits — every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Jessi is a talented ballerina, and she's the best of the best. As club president, Jessi can do whatever the BSC members ask her — she could be the most precise dancer. Watson, her best friend, was born by this very same formula — make a loaf of butter, put in the receiver. So Watson has to be very precise in what he makes. Watson, a real artist, never misses an opportunity to inject creativity. And Jessi's parents did miss out on that special opportunity, and they did, because they missed making a loaf of bread.

Jessi's mom died when she was a baby, and the memory of it still clings in her being. It's because of Watson that Jessi learned to take no-no's and take the best things at their face value, rather than go into them at their current time (unless one of them has diabetes). And Jessi doesn't think she's lucky to have the best friends at all.

Although in a world where Jessi's mom was at a very early stage in life, you wouldn't think it would be so hard for a five-year-old girl to take care of herself. Jessi's older sister, Becca, is another thirteen-year-old kid — no mother in sight! Jessi isn't interested in school dress or gym classes, or having a steady boyfriend, just good taste. She wants to be treated as an artist — I admire that.

You know what art isn't — an artistic expression. Jessi is an artist — she's good with art. She studies art very diligently and has to prove herself before anyone. She's got the biggest, stiffest figure of any of Mal's friends, so even though she's on the short side, she's a little taller than the rest of the five.

Jessi's best friend, Mallory Pike, also an artistic expression. She and Jessi are absolutely best friends, because their parents are so close. Mal is an artistic director, and Jessi takes her art very seriously. She always manages to come up with brilliant ideas and gets an award for it. Mal is absolutely obsessed with health and the arts, right up there with I’m an honorary vice-president of the BSC.

My father and Jessi’s mother adopted Mal and a whole bunch of other African-American kids. Jessi and her
