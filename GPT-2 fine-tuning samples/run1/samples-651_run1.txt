 a thing) and they had no idea who Claudia really was until we started dating again. Then one day Mrs. Thomas met and fell in love with one of the guys in the club and became her best friend. In the end, they fell in love and got married — and the Thomases moved across town to Stoneybrook!

So today we're gathered here on Bradford Court, the main street between Bradford Court and the highway, as far as possible. I’ve got a map of the city plotted on a yellow board, just so my friends and I know where to look. Our offices are evenly distributed so that when someone has one of those many jobs, someone else is free to fill it. And it just so happens that Kristy, one of the most perfect and devoted members of our club, has also been living in the back of a old farmhouse that is now a modest farmhouse. Her stepfather, Watson Brewer, is a millionaire.

Kristy lives with her mom, one younger sister, and three little sisters and brothers. She has absolutely mastered the art of house-cleaning, and she’s been running it ever since. Her father lets her stay with her and, like most poor kids who can’t find a sitter, her father got remarried. That’s when his kids came along.

Kristy’s family history is pretty typical. First of all, she has a pretty big family: (1) her mom and father (she grew up with two older brothers) and (2) Watson Brewer. So why shouldn’t Kristy like Watson’s company most? He’s pretty nice, but he’s divorced from Mary Anne’s father and has two children, a son (David Michael), and two seven-year-old stepsiblings (Claudia, Ben, and Andrew).

Kristy is the shyest, sweetest person on the planet — but her family also happens to have some problems. As a single parent, Kristy faces two problems — availability and quality. She has her own phone, with a private line, so that really doesn’t matter much. Also, her family has a couple of pets, a basset hound (David Michael, a basset hound) and a pedigreed cat (David Michael, very active and loving and fluffy and brown). So Kristy has to deal with both situation all over again, even though she also has a dog, a cat, and a friend, her former best friend Shannon Kilbourne. (Shannon is now an honorary member of the BSC. She moved to Stoneybrook because her parents got divorced and she returned to the streets of town with two older brothers, Sam and David Michael).

Anyway, one thing that’s totally gone wrong with Kristy’s family is food. Watson’s two little kids from his previous marriage, Karen and Andrew, adore junk food and so does Charlotte, the current leader of the BSC. Kristy doesn’t eat junk food, and she really doesn’t like her health problems. Besides diabetes, sugar and protein deficiencies, and the like, I keep seeing her bags of chips in her pants. (No wonder Kristy has to hide her junk food.) She also doesn’t like the idea of eating regular meals at her home, except for school. (A problem, not a solution.)

In order to deal with all of her problems, Kristy’s mom has taken great effort and determination not to mention her boyfriend, Logan. I know this sounds crazy, but take yourself, zoo. It’s pretty. Even Kristy, who goes to the local private school, is successful as a dancer. Her dad just raised her (Karen, this is Dawn Schafer, who just happens to be the mother of Bart and Ryan Arnold!) and she and her younger brother, Jeff, and her dad (Watson, this is our Mr. Spier) ended up marrying Watson’s widow, Mrs. Schafer. They had Dawn, Jeff, and their two older brothers (David Michael, who is five, and Sam, who is four). They also have a pet hamster, a shy cat, and a puppy named Shannon. They used to have pets all over town, but because the Schafers bought all these nice, quiet homes, they now live in mega-new house across from Claudia Kishi’s house. This is a great thing because the kids who are born with only one set of ears have the opportunity to have more than one set of ears, which they have ear-to-ear. This lets them understand different ways of listening. They can tell you a lot about their mother and father, and they know very little about their father. Watson and Sharon Porter are Watson’s two sons, one boy and two girls. They
