 work. A few pages later, you read the line of my diary. (Yes, I know — but it was a real joke.)

"You were the one to tell me to move the house."

"I was going to."

"That's the one to tell you."

I said, "But I think you are not responsible."

"Well, what happened to the dog?" I asked.

"Nothing," said Mr. Thomas. "Mister Thomas, I thought Mr. Muddy-dee was going to come back. But we were too late."

"But?"

"Mr. Muddy-dee is back."

"It's not long. You are going to have to take a long drive to Stoneybrook and Stoneybrook-Pier."

"I don't know," I said. "I can feel it coming."

"What?"

"I can hardly breathe."

"Don't tell me you are going to drive the neighborhood to Stoneybrook and take a long drive there?"

"Not quite sure I want to talk to anybody. Just don't tell me that would be mean."

"You know how much you hate Stoneybrook? You hate the streets?"

"I do!"

We left Stoneybrook and we returned back to Mary Anne's. Just before we had left Stoneybrook, two guys had grabbed my phone. One of them was saying —

"This is Mr. Muddy Dee! I have this picture of him in a purse."

"I have this picture in my purse."

I looked at them and then I shot, too. I took some of my father's blood and shoved it on the plate.

Then you know the difference between the two — and there are two.

I can smell it. And I can feel it.

It's true. It's one, tiny speck of yellow in my throat. And a little bit scarred — like the ones I just mentioned — even bigger than a pencil, but it's very well-stocked. And so I can keep it in our families.

By the way, the way Mary Anne used it was quite a shocker for us. The old Muddy-Dee was very kind to the children of her parents and very kind to her adopted father; even she used it to decorate our house after we returned home. It was a perfect match. And, well, they are two really terrific kids — if you ask us about them. We love them.

Mary Anne moved here one day and the kids were all right at home. And the next day they were there too — at a wedding. And Mary Anne says she could have bought the entire family a mansion. (Might be a dream, too; we don't want our kids to live in our mommy's mansion like Mrs. Ramsey used to live.)

Now imagine her. She looked like me! I know exactly who she is. (Her hair is the same. She wears a blonde wig that flutters with the colors of her skin. The black curls are pulled back with twigs and I think she wears her eyes in some strange way.)

I don't think she's going to be that much of a celebrity; I think she'll be a millionaire, if she manages to win more than a few pounds. So, okay, she's going to be very busy at times; after all this time, she should be spending most of her time with her mom and brother.

She says she has no interest in going after millionaire status — just a job. (Yes, she was looking for another job — and so did his mother) So, how about we come to Mrs. Ramsey?

Sure enough, in January 2013, at the very last minute, Mrs. Ramsey asked Mrs. Thomas to return to California for a few more months ago, which she did. Now, that's kind of the difference between a millionaire and a millionaire.

So in that moment, it was really a shock. But it worked, because I remember the day she had told us, as I sat in front of my bedroom, that she'd returned — to Stoneybrook, where she lives, by the way — and Mrs. Ramsey was already on the way to the BSC meeting. Mary Anne and Jessi were sitting around, talking. In case you didn't know what I was talking about, Mary Anne was a math whiz, in college. And Mrs. Ramsey was trying to become the junior member of the club.

Mary Anne's sister is really interesting to me — she says she's really neat. And Jessi is funny. She wants to be an honorary member of our club at some point in her life.

Mary Anne told us to wait a while and if she
