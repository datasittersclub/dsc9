 here she went home and ate “little””sauce.

“What did I think I ate?” asked Claudia.

“I’m hungry.”

“You?” I asked.

“No!” Claudia replied. “What?” I said.

“Why?”

We all looked at the clock. It was 5:29. We all stayed where we were because the kids were sitting.

“Are you okay, Stacey?” I asked.

“Well,” she replied, “you look good.” (I don’t know if she even understood.)

“You’re not, okay?”

“No,” I said. “I wasn’t looking bad. I’d just … ‘what?”

“Didn’t make sense, you know?”

Claudia laughed. “You were looking at Stacey. She lives in my new house and you haven’t been looking at her in almost three months, even though all you see is her here.”

Stacey has an older sister and her mother lives in my house, so the kids are part of the family.

“How can you ask Stacey to take a dip?” asked Claudia.

I felt stupid. I didn’t think they would have offered us a dip. Instead, I offered them three chips as an excuse. The kids are already planning meals at our house these days. If one of them hadn’t come home from their nap, we would have had two or three chips.

Kristy nodded. “It would have been gross to say that to Stacey. We’re really hungry now, and we’re getting a lot of work. Can you believe the situation is real?”

“Well, you don’t blame Stacey,” Kristy pointed out.

We all looked at each other. We all gritted our teeth. (Kristy said we were both scared.)

The phone started ringing and we’m both looking out at the ocean. Kristy was on the phone. “We just need kids!” she said.

“All right,” I said. “I’ll call you right back.”<|endoftext|>
My phone is so cluttered that I almost fall over when I check it. I guess I should stay at a hospital because those three people must be in a coma. I think, though, that this is probably because I don’t care what people think about me, that I'm a genius and just a regular kid.

And not that I don’t care. I don’t mind people saying I look like their idea of a serious genius. Maybe that’s what makes me so cool. If I have a boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever, they want me to be cool. They’ve been my best friends ever since we were in diapers. But the way I dress makes me different. I can’t stand the idea of someone wearing a T-shirt or wearing a baseball cap or a sweatshirt.

I guess for a little freakish you wouldn’t put me next to Mary Anne, but for the most part, Mary Anne's the only one of us who thinks it’s fun to dress up as the next best thing. Like, totally different from what we wear.

Not that there’s anything wrong with me, though. It’s just that I’m a good artist. And that’s how I found out that Jessi Ramsey, my best friend, and Mal.

I’ve dated them before, but they’re not my twin girls. And for all that time, Mal and I lived next door to each other. We were the two main girls in our grade, but it was only in seventh grade when Mal and I began to get to know each other. When my mom died, she decided we weren’t ready to baby-sit. Then they came to Stoneybrook together, and we became friends.

So that’s what it sounds like: We were a little closer than you might imagine. We’d been with a lot of identical twins before! But after Stacey and Jessi and I both went into foster care, Stacey moved out of the neighborhood and back. Jessi moved back to Connecticut. Stacey and Mal and I were in the same foster home, Stoneybrook Manor. The rest is history.

I mean, it
