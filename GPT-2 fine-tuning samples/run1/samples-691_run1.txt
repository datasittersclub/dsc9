 the world's coolest kid. We had just stopped eating pretzels and drinking Milk Duds and other gross stuff and he had been doing things like this. He really wasn't enjoying himself.

Abby’s other big achievement was helping him think creatively. (Well, I’m very proud of her.) She’s the brains behind the “Funky-Fries Club.” It’s a BSC consisting of people we baby-sit for, who share an interest in fashion, but Abby doesn’t like schoolwork. It’s not such a good attitude. And, at that age, you just couldn’t be too sure that no one else was going to do anything creative. But Abby has a really neat, very cool “funky-fries club.”

Abby has a little sister named Becca and a baby brother named Squirt. (Abby’s “little brother” is a dog, and he is a good boy. He’s really nice.) Their mom works so hard and also just takes a lot of sitting jobs while she’s away on the East Coast. I can understand why they are upset. They have lots of kids to take care of and I’m sad their father isn’t back in New York.

Mary Anne Spier and Logan Bruno are our associate members. One of them is Shannon Kilbourne, Mary Anne’s other best friend.

In the back of our minds we would talk about how much fun it was to be a newcomer to Stoneybrook and get to know a new baby-sitter. It was great to see the other girls.

How would I describe Mary Anne? Any suggestions?

“Sweet, mellow, fun.”

“Midway through words….”

“End of conversation.”

“Great. We have another meeting. See you later.”

We were all looking for our first baby-sitter since Shannon, and this was going to be fun. We invited all our friends to join, and we made an effort — which was a little hard — to split the work between Mrs. Masters and Kristy. Kristy’s family used to live on my street, so she was about three times more likely to move in with Dawn than with Dawn’s father.

This sounded great, until Dawn said she was leaving the house for California. Dawn has lived here for seven years, and I have known she’s really come back. Now I had the feeling she was going to be so busy with schoolwork, anyway. It was nice having her in our club, and it made me feel better about missing out on her brother and dad — my best friend and dearest baby brother outside of Stoneybrook. I knew that at some point after eighth grade I’d have to go back to New York and live with Mr. Spier forever. But since Dawn’s coming back, I’m not thinking about that anymore. I feel much more settled in and comfortable in Stoneybrook. And I still get to see the city where my friends live, anyway.

I really admire Kristy and wish she had the guts to think about it. But she hasn’t. She chose her words so I could hear her say them:

Rrrrrrring!

Rrrrrring! (Sigh)

Rrrring!

Oh, boy. It’s thr�rrrrrrring!

It was going on all over. I felt like running out of the room! How was I supposed to survive?

I ran to the door and peered in.

“Oh, hi, Mary Anne. I am Kristy Thomas,” I said. This was going to be a very tough, sleepless night for me.<|endoftext|>
"It's only a little after eight, but the wind is picking up just a little more," Claudia said. "Just remember to chill out."
I sighed and set the phone down. "Stoneybrook Manor," I said, "come on in. We’ll check and have a snack."

Claudia and Stacey walked in and we ate in silence for about half an hour. Then Stacey said, "So what exactly are you asking? Do you really think I have to stay in your care for three months?"

"I don’t think so. For the next three months we’ll all be thirteen and in the hospital. I mean, when I get older. I don’t want to give up my braces. I don’t really care what anyone thinks. I think my ears should be pierced. And I think my
