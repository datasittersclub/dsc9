 the second half, and it turned out that it was an awful lot better than I expected. While we were at the shop, we met up for a private dance in the lobby of Mr. Kishimoto's, which is where we usually meet.

When we returned home from the dance, the BSC was still working on our meeting. We were still looking forward to the meeting, when a knock at our door brought up the BSC.

"Come on in," I told Emily, who had just returned from her meeting. She looked in Kristy's room. And Emily was sitting there, too.

"I need a favor," Emily said. "I have my phone number and I need to take a little meeting at the office. You guys can call me when we're ready."

I smiled at her for a second.

"Sure, we can," I said back, taking off my shirt. I hadn't paid much attention to Kristy's phone and hadn't made any phone calls. (Jessi's phone is the company's secret client number, so it's hard to tell Kristy anything we don't have in our clients' names.)

"Jessi," Emily said. "Do you have to be here every day?"

"As much as we're making calls from time to time," I replied quickly.

"Of course," she answered evenly.

"You don't have to do a phone-calls for one day. Just call, and tell Kristy to be patient."

"Sure," Mary Anne said, her voice sounding a little more businesslike. "I like to call at the office, and tell the boss."

"Thanks," said Kristy. She hung her head and rolled her eyes.

“You think?" Mary Anne asked. “You think so?”

"I'll help you do that, thank you very much," Kristy said. She stretched out her arms. “Don’t worry about answering the phone,” she added.

The BSC had just met for the first time at Krushers meeting, so you could bet that they had already talked about meeting. They were planning to hold their meeting this afternoon, at the BSC. But that was before they'd even opened their phone book. The phone book was where you store up a lot of things, really. I know they talked up how big the BSC was, but that wasn’t really helpful, so I “took it down a long time ago.”

“But,” Jessi added. “We should just hold it until it’s closed.”

"Yeah, great!” Kristy said. She reached out and took out a phone book — a little notebook of her own that she had put up for the BSC when I first started. It was full of rules and rules-and-plans, and lots of fun ideas, like the T-shirt I’d just put on. One thing: A dress code. I never got it figured out, but when the BSC had to call the club members up to check my phone for any calls, they were thrilled. The rules are there and ready to go. I like it. I don’t think we have to worry about it anymore, either.

But I think that the BSC is getting used to Claudia’s personality. It’s a little too easy to treat them differently. They don’t show that much emotion in the middle of a meeting, and not at all.

Claudia is a gorgeous girl and her eyes are sparkling. She loves art, and is a great dancer. Her mother died when Claudia was a baby. Her aunt Emily died when she was much younger. Claudia is kind and very kind. You know that when you’re in her room, you can smell the best in her, right? It’s not always pretty. But sometimes it gets better. Claudia was very thoughtful about the rules and plans they had for her, especially the club dress code. For example, the club dress code was that if anyone looks at us on the bus that weekend, that person knows what to wear. The club dress code is not to dress in shorts and running shoes, or in shorts and running clothes, but in running shoes.

But this dress code was one thing that Claudia and I always had in common. The club dress code. She used to wear dresses in her house, but no longer — she had to wear dresses that she didn’t like. It was a bit hard for us, but at the end of the day, we all had to dress up. Stacey and I were both thrilled that we were being treated so well by Claudia.

Our meeting was held at the club meeting room.
