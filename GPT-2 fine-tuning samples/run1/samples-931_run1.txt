 she would not be too maddening. But I think the big-picture person in the BSC really is Kristy. Maybe her BSC ideas are more “ideological” than mine, and they’re both a little “conservative” about clothes and hair, and “just” about everything else. Kristy’s way of thinking is “individualistic,” which has two parts. First, she believes that every human being is a distinct being, like Mary Anne and me. Second, she believes that a person’s personality is her brain. In other words, her thinking is so tightly integrated that nothing can escape it. In other words, Kristy is a free thinker and a good listener. I think that’s the main reason she’s such a good listener. Her other big ideas include the Baby-sitters Club notebook, which we used to write in because the members didn’t agree on everything.

Our newest member, Abby, is someone who was born and raised in Stoneybrook. She’s eleven and in the eighth grade and very skinny. She has to wear pants like little kids. She can’t put her hair on and she hates her circles because they show up too much. Anyway, I think she’s got one of the prettiest faces I’ve ever seen. She has long silky, jet-black hair, and she’s got a great smile the whole time. I wonder if she’s ever had a pimple or something on her face.

Abby has a new sister, Anna, who’s eight and already on a French Club cruise ship. Abby doesn’t always like her sister and sometimes Abby takes Anna’s departure cruder than Kristy’s.

Our new member is Mallory, our first pick for secretary. She used to be one of our nurses. She’s slim, with blue eyes and pale skin. In fact, even now, I think I’m the shortest person in the BSC, even though I have my own phone with two lines, so I get to call the shots. Mal is pretty cool. She wears red, is blonde, and has long, long dancer’s legs. Her feet are supposed to be in the middle of mud. I think she studies ballet and might well dance for the big stage performances.

The dance section of the BSC often includes lots of singing and lots of laughing. When I first started, many of our clients felt uncomfortable because they didn’t feel they could sing along to most of our shows. That seems crazy now, but it was a reality then. Now the only job where the rest of us can’t is singing, it’s great!

Mal thinks she’d sung like a certifiable lead if she had to do anything, but we all know how she thinks she’s written all the parts in. She also wrote the opening and ending lines of the record book so that when the rest of us read them, we can make sure we all get the parts right. It’s fun to read that everybody here loves it when each of us gets to sing.

I think Mal’s writing style is pretty unique. Not only does she write in perfect, but she writes in a style that is different from the others’ so that she and Jessi feel extra welcome here. I think the girls really picked up some strength from the way they complimented each other. It’s a good thing they do that.

“Nicky!” Kristy piped up, and we all began laughing except for Mallory. She is such a nice person and a terrific friend. Mal’s also allergic to just about everything, including the weird stuff she eats, and so it made it out of her system a little easier.

Our newest member, Abby, checked in to say she was already booked in. I thought that meant she wouldn’t be able to take the job until she’d taken more classes.

And that is how our club got started. What started out as just a dream became reality because of my mom.

“Hi!” called Jessi while they were still speaking. “Come on over,” she called, and we were all just passing around peanut butter and jelly beans. “I might need some help with breakfast.”

Jessi and Mal started laughing because Jessi is so into activities. She’s a ballet dancer, and it shows. Jessi practices all the time, and she even dances on the back of glass show cars.

Mallory looked up and said, “You have to be patient,” although she didn’t know if Mallory thought she
