 door: a new owner.)

The two parents had decided to get acquainted, and by the time they arrived at Claudia's apartment, Mrs. Stevenson was explaining to Mrs. Barrett how the Barretts' newest home would work out. (Here's how that happened.)

“We’d just begun homework,” Mrs. Stevenson said, “and we were watching Claudia and Dawn walk into the apartment with their mother, and pull their mother away.”

Then Mrs. Stevenson announced that the Barretts were moving into an apartment that was going to have a secret passageway that would be theirs, too.

“What was that?” I asked her.

“It would be great,” Mrs. Stevenson replied, “but it would have to be permanent. It’s not just some kind of vault around the yard. It’s going to be … wonderful.”

“It would be like being inside a haunted house,” Kristy protested.

I nodded. “Maybe. But these were great times.”<|endoftext|>
The sun started setting, and I looked around for a way to escape. I pictured two things that I could do to help: swim and hide in the closet.

The closet. How did I get into it? It’s a long way from my bedroom, so you have to take a long walk to get from one place in the house to another. But hey, it’s a short walk to your parent’s, so you’re not out of it. In fact, it’s a breeze. If you walk from my home (on Bradford Court, across from the Korman house) to the Korman house, you almost never see it.

There was an old photo of me in the closet. That was a long time ago, and I still have that old photo. It’s very important, because my parents don’t think I have pictures of my full face. They think, though, that I’m too young for that. I’ve got lovely long, silky black hair and big blue eyes and these beautiful blue eyes (I’m not beautiful, they don’t go away if I’m not wearing the best clothes). And I wear these little outfits to school the next day because my hair is way too much for school clothes.

In my mind, the closet is just a convenient hiding place since I’m not much older than I usually am. Mom already has a steady job, so she doesn’t mind keeping a closet full of clothes. I can’t do it, though since I’m fifteen and in eighth grade right now. Mom says it’s not worth it. I agree, and she tells me it’s not worth it anyway.

I tried to sound understanding by saying that I think the closet is a convenient place because my parents don’t want me to look younger than they had been wearing, either. You see, Mom likes me a lot because I am exactly who she says I am — outgoing, energetic, funny, and healthy. I wear these clothes all the time and I feel just like her.

Okay, so let me talk about the other BSC members. I’m going to start with Jessi, since she’s my best friend. Since I’m eleven and in sixth grade, I’m the younger member of the BSC. Okay, so here’s how that happened. Since I am eleven and in sixth grade, Jessi and I are second-graders, not eighth-graders. I’m thrilled to be in seventh, because there are so many younger members of the BSC. Jessi and I were looking forward to having our charges (Kristy, Dawn, and I) sit in the director’s chair in the afternoons, since that wouldn’t be too uncomfortable, and we were very glad when the lights came on that day. (We liked that idea.) The BSC has seven regular members, nine vice-presidential, and two associates members (three if it’s a job we have to handle constantly, which is always the case).

At the beginning of seventh, I had an idea for the club. I thought of something. One way to attract more clients would be to have special baby-sitting hours. The BSC and parents talked until about a week later when I was trying to make up with them. Then I wanted to see if I could get some other club member to join me.

So that’s it. As you can see, the club has one member right now, a girl named Shannon Kilbourne. She’s
