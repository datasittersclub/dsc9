 into a long-term relationship. This is a very difficult one and one that I'm sure you'll learn about in the next few paragraphs.

Kristy and I are best friends. We live near the headquarters of the company we work for. We meet for our own business when we're not doing meetings, which is when the meetings are booked. We also associate regularly with Kristy, although I think there's really no way to tell which one of us is on the job. I guess this is partly why we were adopted — we've stayed together since before we were born.

Jessi is the newest of those. She's the oldest, meaning she's grown up more than she has, but her parents aren't particularly strict. She doesn't eat sweets or stuff, and she's never made a mistake. We're both okay with being told to treat ourselves as if we are pets. It's fine, though, for Jessi to hide her body heat, her diabetes, and her braces — especially her braces. But she's a little sensitive about her looks, and she has to work hard to keep herself and her brothers and sisters healthy, though we all grumble at the thought of Claudia's glasses and her braces.

As you'd guess from the name, Stacey is the newest member of the BSC. She's a really good artist. She can paint, draw, paint, draw, and draw. What she does with her talents is beyond her abilities. Her mother is an absolute genius, and when Stacey was a baby, the only way they could help her was by letting her paint, draw, paint, or draw after her. (Claudia used to be so creative, she could be the genius behind a pencil and her mother didn't allow it to draw.) When we first met Stacey, she was eleven years old and in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle. Then, when Kristy began to feel better, Kristy moved on to sixth, which gave Claud a great job. After that? I have to admit that she didn't need it.

Stacey is a fantastic student. She's really good at math and science. She was president of her school's high school team until she got moved to New York, when the vice-president began to hate her. Well, not all the other coaches, like Stacey, really liked Stacey. But when the vice-president was convinced Stacey was being out-homers, she transferred to New York. After she'd returned, Stacey was busy in California with her work with the Baby-sitters Club, keeping up with her dad, and helping her stepbrother, Nicky, who was in high school.

Stacey is the first of us to get the job because we are the club's vice-president. I know that since we aren't junior officers, we can't be allowed to replace someone else if we're absent. It's a big deal to have a job where both Kristy and I are responsible for collecting dues.

We don't have official job titles, but we do have the occasional appointment with us, and vice-president for the time being. That means that if someone would like to speak for us, we could let her know. She can call us at anytime during the week, and she always knows which seat we are booked for at that time.

We also have two associate members. They do not come into the club to sit for us when we're off the phone, and they don't attend meetings. So they don't sit for us at night, but we do have their number. They also aren't allowed to sit for anybody else.<|endoftext|>
“I’ve finally gotten to that point!”

It was still dark, and I knew I needed to sleep on my bed.

“You’re going to make me think that way about the Stacey we fell in love with,” Nicky said, looking down at the little girl, her bright green eyes looking out over the town. “She’d be so nice to you when we fell in love,” she said. “Maybe we should be together again. Our parents are gone and we need somebody to coach our siblings away from the streets of New York City when the time comes. It’s a good idea. And the odds that the people who grew up here live here for another hundred years are extremely small.”

“I’ll do it,” I cried. I told Nicky about the meeting I had with Stacey. I told her about the meeting with Claudia.

“We’re on your case,” Nicky said. “I’m going to call you right away.”

“Oh,” Kristy said. “Good idea,” I said
