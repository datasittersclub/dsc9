 moved to Stoneybrook, and that the other kids were quite scatterbrainible. But they were there for a long time. And now they’re much better off, especially since Watson and Abby become sisters.

Abby’s a little younger and a little taller. But since she’s got a best friend, she’s naturally pretty smart. But she has other things to do. For instance, she studies ballet at the Dance New York school. She eats health food and other things her heart can handle.

Jessi and Mallory are junior BSC members because they’re eleven years old and in sixth grade. Neither of them has had a steady boyfriend in ages. Instead, they’ve split up. In the split-up split-up, there was the Stoneybrook girls, and now there’s Abby. They’re much happier, which I think contributes to their happy endings.

Jessi and Mallory seem to have some kind of lasting bond. They both appreciate their parents’ firm rules that no brown bag-dressing or junk food is allowed at school or on the job. But there was one person who had to settle for less than sweetest of boyfriend in the group.

Mary Anne Spier. She would almost certainly marry someone else. I could see her doing that, as long as she added “Dawn!” to her title in the record book in case anyone saw something funny. If Kristy wanted someone to replace Dawn, Dawn would have been the one to take it. But Dawn (and her brother, Jeff) lived in California permanently, so Kristy replaced her at the club headquarters in Claudia’s bedroom. This way, Mal and Jessi (who are eleven and in eighth grade) wouldn’t have to go to the same doctor twice and once and once twice in the first few months after they turned thirteen. It’s a good thing they were all so friendly.

Anyway, that’s the other thing about my BSC. We really care about kids. That’s why we hold meetings and parties for our charges after and after we kick off an event.

The last and main ingredient in the service — and not something we baby-sit for — my diabetes didn’t come with me. It occurred to Mary Anne when I slipped into my room and turned on my diabetes watch. Without my insulin, it would have been too easy for me to become extremely sick. In case you don’t know what that means, let me explain. First, when you get too sick, your body stops producing certain types of energy. That’s how insulin works. When you get too sick, your body tries to use some of the fuel it has to use to break down the junk food that's been left over from time to time.) So your body is totally flooded with sugar. If you let too much sugar in your diet, your blood could start clogging up the toilet, and you could get really sick. You can even go into a coma. So the more sugar you eat, the more your body starts working hard to break down the stuff in your body. So it’s a good thing that diabetes is a severe illness for Mary Anne and her family.

When I got the insulin working, Mary Anne was almost as excited as I was. Even though I had only just bitten off so much, I could tell she was dying to talk to her boyfriend, Logan Bruno. Maybe that’s why he was at our party. Logan’s one of our regulars, and he’s usually our associate club member, which means he helps out when people are on hold or in our clubs. Being a junior member means he doesn’t come to meetings, but we call him as often as we can.

I checked my watch — five minutes until meeting time. Almost certainly we would face a crisis.

“Brenner Field will become yours,” I said.

“Brenner Field is Arnolds’!” shouted Bart, jumping up and down on Mary Anne’s private porch.

“Is that so?” said Mary Anne, passing him a bag of organic corn chips.

“Is it?” I asked and bared my teeth.

“I got it. No offense, Mary Anne, but Arnolds are proud to call them ”friends.”

“Hi, Mary Anne. How did you know?”

I pretended I understood what Mary Anne was saying.

The phone rang during our meeting time. Mary Anne checked the records book to see if she’d been assigned a meeting. We did.

Mary Anne got a hold of me and said, “I’ll need a sitter for next
