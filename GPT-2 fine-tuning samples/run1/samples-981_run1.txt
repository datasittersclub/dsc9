“So,” I said, “what was her name? That’s funny. It’s Stacey.” When I looked up, I saw that she was on the verge of breaking into tears. “Amelia! Me!” She had pulled aside and cried, “Oh, no! Are you feeling all right? I couldn’t help it. Am I mad?”

As Mrs. Stevenson lay in her waiting room she cried, “Are you sure you can get over this? I’ve only been looking at TV so far and I’ve been watching what you’ve said, and I don’t think I heard you say that you’re sure.”

As she was saying that, she flashed me a wry smile. “I just saw what was happening with the Marshalls today.”

“You saw what they were going after?” Abby asked.

Kristy straightened. “Neither the Marshalls nor the DeWitts. She just saw me being chased. That was scary.”

“Then what was scary,” I said. “What was happening?”

“I saw the Marshalls shoot at the DeWitts because I was in a drama class. And then the DeWitts chased the Marshalls’ dog.”

“You’re sure?” Abby asked.

“Sure. The Marshalls and the DeWitts chased the DeWitts.” I shook my head. “No!”

I looked around the room. I saw everyone’s jaws were full of people I’d actually mentioned. I’d mentioned the Marshalls, the DeWitts, the pets, and even the cat. “Well,” I said, “I’m sure! And I’m sure of the Baby-sitters Agency!”

“Wait!” Claudia rushed over to me. “Wait! I’ve got the Baby-sitters Agency in my book! I’ve got the essential ingredient! The one we all need — the one Barbara, the love of Barbara’s lives, the only one who knows how to formulaate a baby-sitter. I’ve got it! What’s wrong with us?"

“Kristy! Want to hear something I haven’t told you?” I grabbed Barbara’s hands behind her back. “That’s a good thing because that’s when I heard the big mouthful. It’s catching up on me and making me act shocked. I kept my eye on the floor as she spat out what’d justated me. “Kristy!” she barked. “It looks like I better go after my throat now, okay?”

I tried not to smile. Barbara’s eyes were watering, and she was holding her hands in front of her face in a giant mouth. “We better get to work, okay?”

“We better,” Barbara said miserably. “What’s the point? I’m being told the truth and I’m not supposed to talk about this.”

I tried to act as if the whole point of my talk were my reaction to speak up later.

“I’m not supposed to talk about this,” I said. “What’s the point?”

“Now you know what the point is.”

I didn’t care what point the woman was trying to make. The point was that the Baby-sitters Agency was closing down in Manhattan. We’d only been here eight days. Any other business would have been canceled.

Claudia was getting fidgety and fidgety.

“You know what the point is,” Barbara said apologetically. “I know what the point is.”

“What’s the point?” Barbara asked us.

“I’m not supposed to talk about it.” I didn’t even bother to try to interrupt her.

“What’s the point?” Claudia repeated.

“I’m supposed to do some stuff.”

“What’s the point?” I blurted out.

I tried to get through the rest of the interview so Claudia could watch. But I was too weak to respond.
