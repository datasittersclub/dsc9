, and the one guy in particular that can be trusted and loved. Then, when you've befriended someone, you've been able to convince him or her that you're a good friend. (Which may sound crazy, since it might have just been some other sad thing, but it's not. I mean, can you imagine?)

Then it's a full time job, and everyone's schedule is so cluttered with responsibilities that just thinking about what each of us can do makes us really happy. We just have to be more patient, take responsibility, and take our jobs seriously.

My friends, these days I'm an organized person. I don't want to be the person who feels guilty, for example, for calling a friend and then forgetting to call her right back, which is what Shannon and Mallory always do.

For me, meeting new people for the first time isn't enough. It has to be exciting for me to see what happens next. And when it does, I want to be as whole, whole, and happy as I can be. To see my brothers and sisters, to see Mimi and me, to hear their stories, to hear the stories of their families. I'm in a different world than everyone else.

It's funny, though, that my parents, who don't approve of my music (or even my singing, for that matter), make it an official duty of permission for me to practice so I can play the piano, which I love. But they're not perfect. For instance, my dad always said that he liked it, too. Not because I can sing, but because I don’t quite understand my own mind. I think my mom still sees it that way sometimes. And lately, one of her feelings is that I shouldn't be studying. I mean, I'm a violinist. But I’m good enough to practice some violin and make some friends. Besides, I have plenty of experience playing a viola and singing.

Kristy Thomas, who’s the club president, and Mary Anne's other best friend, is the treasurer of the club. (She’s the one who comes up with the names.) In fact, the record book is the club notebook — another of Kristy’s great ideas. For years, Kristy’s family had lived in this farmhouse in the hills near Lake Oahe. But once Mrs. Thomas moved away, she couldn’t be sure of staying in it anymore. Mrs. Thomas decided to live with her mom, who moved back to Stoneybrook after her dad’s company transferred him to California. (Mrs. Thomas has three younger brothers.)

Mary Anne visits Mrs. Thomas a lot. And when she’s away, she writes up all our jobs in the notebook. The record book is a personal diary, which is also much more personal than the notebook. We write about the past few years — how I’ve learned a lot along the way — and also about what’s happening in school.

So that’s it. So I’m always happy to introduce you to anyone I happen to be sitting for. I’ve made up my mind that I’m going to sit for Jessi’s sister, Margo, and I’m going to make two friends from the sixth grade. I’m going to share the room with Jessi. Which is okay, because I’ve got plenty of friends.

When I decided to move to Stoneybrook, I missed school. Well, I probably missed a bunch of other people. But now I know who I really am: Jessi and Mal are best friends and best friends and they’re in the seventh grade. That’s because their parents forbid Jessi and her brothers from touching things (eleven-year-old Oreos are forbidden in their houses), and I’m their best friend while they’re at school. They’re okay with sitting and eating out and taking their cell phones off, but they get jealous sometimes, and sometimes they even get really, really jealous of me.

That day, Mal had taken her bag for the walk and was trying to make herself a hamburger. "I love hamburgers," she said dryly. "But I don’t like hamburgers so much."

"I mean, don’t get me wrong," Kristy retorted. "The BSC calls my brothers and sisters 'twos.'"

"Oh, they belong to Claudia and Mary Anne," said Abby. She grabbed her two forks from Mal.

"Claudia and Mary Anne don’t belong to the BSC," Kristy said. "They’re the same family."

"Me too," Jessi said dryly.
