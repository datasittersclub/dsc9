 Monday. She’s really cute. And the BSC is definitely a group. It has about as many members as a small restaurant with a regular menu should have. (It didn’t have to be that way until we started our business.) It has officers plus two associate members who never sit at our meetings — Mary Anne and my best friend, Logan Bruno.

Logan is an excellent boyfriend. He really cares about his younger brother and always wants to be an athlete. He’s gorgeous and has the best of curly red hair and glasses, and he always dresses in his own summer style, jeans, sneakers, a turtleneck.

In my opinion, Logan is the most talented guy I know. In fact, he has really been studying our schedules and telling us what we need to do for the first time during the week. Logan is an athlete, just like mine is an athlete. He takes great care of himself and has never, ever, been in a car accident. His memory is pretty good and everything is going great. He looks just like me. I bet he even looks a little like Kristy Thomas — short, lean, very dark-skinned, with curly reddish-brown hair.

Logan is very cool, and I guess he is because he comes from a small, very conservative town. It wasn’t always like that. The Braddocks were pretty far away (in Logan’s neighborhood), and life was pretty much the same again when Kristy Thomas first moved here. For starters, Logan was born and raised in Stoneybrook. He has soft, wiry brown hair and big brown eyes.

As you can see, Kristy is the most conservative person I know. And I see how that plays out. Logan and Kristy are the two oldest kids in their families, they have been together forever, even before Kristy’s mom married Watson Brewer, and Mrs. Thomas became a millionaire after the marriage. I guess that family has some crazy energy and a sense of humor about them. I mean, they just couldn’t be more different. Kristy, on the other hand, is quiet and reserved.

The last person who stood out was Mary Anne Spier. She had the coolest outfit I’ve ever seen. It was a great one … black on black with little-girl-stripe buttons. The buttons were so cool, I could barely wait to wear them. They looked amazing on Mary Anne, and I just couldn’t stop giggling. Even so, I was more than glad to have her working on my sweater. She looks very glamorous working with her sleeves rolled up, which is her way of saying that she’s got big blue eyes and big brown skin and hair. I like that.

Our other important member was Stacey McGill, our treasurer. Stacey is as cool as Mary Anne (the Hobarts are like ice cream parlors), but cooler. She has a boyfriend named Richard Fowler, but he just happens to be a sports freak. He has a dog named Tigger and a sister named Charlotte. They live right across the street from me, and while I can understand the feelings of a couple who find a puppy dog hilarious (especially one with a big mouth like Tigger), Stacey is quite the animal. She’s super-polite, and we hardly ever touch on her clothes. To tell the truth, I don’t like Stacey’s wild clothes either. In fact, I don’t know how she feels about them. I think she should have her hair cut short, and used to be known as Marilyn Monroe’s cat. Her hair is actually short, too — you can see it in her outfits. Her father doesn’t eat meat, but Stacey says she should. She can’t eat sugary food (unless it’s from the club's headquarters at Louie’s), but Stacey insists on injecting herself with fatty fish every day.

Anyway, Stacey lives across the street from me, but her parents are divorced and her aunt Cecelia is still living with her family. Stacey’s dad left the family when her younger sister, Anna, was born, then moved back to New York. And she ended up moving back with her father, because her parents still live in Stoneybrook. (I don’t think they did before my brother David Michael bought us into his triplet.) If Stacey had not been living here, she could be one of a kind of a sweet cat, like Tigger or Charlotte Johanssen, but she wasn’t going to be as athletic.

Stacey also has a little brother named Barrett (also known as Tigger). He does everything right and nobody else could care less. They’re eleven, two years older than the rest of us, and
