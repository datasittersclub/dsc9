 us, we'll call you right back.

We don't call you back until after the club meeting (which happens three times a week), after we sit in the office, after we eat at the bar (actually, two days a week we call you back to let you know we're there at a special meeting), after the party (which takes place seven times a week), after you call Claudia (our other vice-president), before you guys do anything except complain about our clients. That's why it saves us so much work.

There's a good reason I should tell you that we call every Monday after school, after we eat at the restaurant, after we baby-sit, after school on weekends.

And I think you should know that this isn't just a club business. There are other ways we organize jobs. There have been jobs for the last several years at a local movie theater and for a pizza place. And there are jobs for kids at a local book store at night.

We've organized a bunch of job pages on the official club calendar and on our private official calendar. That way you can keep track of all our schedules. And we keep the rates we'll earn up to a certain amount if we reach the certain number of clients.

That's why it's important to make sure all the charges are filled in to the right spot. That's how we record our rates: by knowing our rates, we know how much each job pays. That's how we keep track of our rates and keep the job information available to job seekers. It's also because our associates know, and we use the information, to advertise jobs we're hiring to our clients.

Remember that last paragraph of my last one of those meetings that you mentioned we used to go over? Well, it took some of us longer than the rest of us, but now we're all friends again. We're friends because of the friendship we have, and because of the fact that in school we also attend Stoneybrook Day. That's because we're both seven years old and both come from pretty different families. Sometimes we talk about our families, sometimes we never talk about them. But right now I don't think we're all that different.

The good thing about all of that is that now we're family-friendly. We're not just sitting in the same room, having a great time, all the time. We're families (well, not families, but the ones that are close to each other). The good thing about making our kids and family look alike is that everyone has their own style and personality to the way they dress, talk, speak, and play. I know I should describe our Kid-Kits like so:

Kid-Kits:

Clothing for the Baby-sitters Club:

Clothing — in any type of natural colors;

Kid-Kit:

Kid-Kit is a bunch of little things, mostly clothes, sometimes with markers, stickers, and instructions all over them. It has a great assortment of materials, but I think we're all better off with Kid-Kit than with clothes.

Clothing for a BSC meeting:

Kid-Kit — all kinds of basic, hand-me-down things like socks, jeans, shirt, loafers, knapsacks, skirts, turtlenecks, and the like, but especially stuff like baby-sitting books and coloring book.

Clothing — in any sort of natural colors and other styles of clothing.

Kid-Kit — lots of fun, but I haven't really studied a lot of the materials or organized them so that I can tell you a little much about how some things work or where they don't.

Kid-Kit — we use the Kid-Knitters, our BSC associates. But this is where it gets weird. We use those associate members to take phone calls from clients. And we have a great record that anyone can find out about us while we take our own calls. What we're really good at is tying in with associate calls. That means we keep track of a lot of the other people we call. That means that a BSC call with an associate will go through every household and we can even tie in with the clients from that house, if we are interested.

Clothing — in any kind of natural colors, like sweaters and tights, or any other style of clothing. No matter where we're going — in a shoe store, in a trendy new style of perfume, or in the clothes of a college student. (And we all know that college kids often call us.)

Kid-Kit — lots of fun, but I haven't really studied a lot of the materials or organized them so that I can tell you a little much about how some things work. Kid-Kit is about clothes, and it's a good thing Kid-Kits are made with
