 of her parents, Mary Anne and Philip (Mary Anne lives with her mother and the family, while her dad still lives in New York City). Mary Anne's mom died when she was only a baby. In her day her mother and father were best friends. (That's why Mary Anne is on the short list of vice-president of the BSC.)

Speaking of Mary Anne, she’d been in a lot of commercials lately, with the BSC and her family at various points during that time. Her hair will be on thick this Thursday, after school on Wednesday, for example. She’d probably be wearing jeans and running shoes the entire time, or maybe just running shoes. She doesn’t care about shoes any more, though. Her parents, Charlie and Mary Anne, think they’re cool. (They even gave Mr. and Mrs. Schafer a fake ID that matched their address in order to make sure they weren’t impersonators. That way the BSC staff wouldn’t be so strict. The Schafers weren’t being rude at all.)

Stacey McGill will be the club’s treasurer. She doesn’t really have much to do with the club: she collects dues per week, and doesn’t pay anyone else’s part of the club dues. That means she has to do it without anyone knowing she’s being treated like a regular client.

Mary Anne’s parents also disapprove of Stacey’s weight gain. Mary Anne sometimes cries if she cries, and she has to go to the movies too much to make sure she gets enough sleep. (Another major blow against the BSC. They made her wear too much — and she sometimes cries all the time.)

Stacey, by the way, is a real math whiz. (She’s also a talented editor. She’s on her way to be a kind of New York City type of whiz.)

If you haven’t already guessed, Mary Anne is the club vice-president. She manages all the duties of the president. She keeps track of all our conflicts (no, not in the BSC,’s translation department), as well as the club’s treasury. During my last job, I raised the issue of our club meeting scheduling, for instance, and decided that if we asked everyone to take a meeting in order (for example), we might be able to avoid having eight vice-president on hand at once.

Besides being a math whiz, Mary Anne is a math whiz. She’s also in charge of our treasury. She’s got a lot of the same ideas as Stacey. For instance, we pay dues to Stacey’s brother Charlie, as well as to Claudia’s room. Also, Stacey does all of our sitting. And Stacey coaches one of the world’s better kickers, an actual track ball.

Stacey is a real math whiz, not just a math whiz. She loves to draw, paint, jewelry-match, and sculpt. She’s into all those things. And she is a terrific baby-sitter. When Kristy had called the meeting to order and told Mary Anne that Mary Anne and Charlie were free, we knew it was no big deal. Now Stacey has taken over the job.

Stacey’s the treasurer. She collects the dues and writes the Kid-Kits, each listing a dollar amount and telling us who’s free to go to where. Sometimes we need extra cash to pay for Claudia’s phone bill. I don’t know exactly how much money we have left over to pay for other expenses. (Claud also has to go to the movies every week!)

Stacey doesn’t often get the news from Stoneybrook — that’s because she lives there because her dad’s job was cut short by a stroke. Stacey feels that she must have taken things too fast (no, that’s not true, since your average New York City man still takes over when his workweek runs out). But I think I know what she thought — that this was a terrible world for Stacey’s family. Her mom is a divorced mother with two grown-ups in California, but Stacey and her mom look and sound normal. Stacey’s also got a stepbrother, Jeff, who is a real health-food fanatic, and a daughter, Becca, who is eight years old and has the looks of a baby. Becca lives with her parents; she has no siblings; and her dad works as a real grocery store cashier. Mrs. Johansson’s family also has two older brothers who live with her and with her after-school friends.

Stacey and
