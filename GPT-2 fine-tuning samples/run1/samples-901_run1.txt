 feel and talk and eat and live and learn and love and don’t we have enough responsibility? No way!”

It was a good day for Mary Anne. She started the math class she always won at lunch, but the rest of us were flipping through the pages of the paper, reading the BSC charter school papers (which are almost always signed by their owners) and complaining all afternoon. They’re really proud of themselves, but they wouldn’t be so lucky if they got to know Mary Anne. They’d get to know her older sister, Janine, and her new baby brother, Andrew, all by reading the paper that morning. They’d also be able to learn to best the new member, Buddy, who happens to be a Stoneybrook native and has the easiest, quickest, most predictable route to the club.

Mary Anne, as I mentioned before, is the BSC vice president. In my mind, she runs the meetings and keeps the money she makes because she’s terrific. She’s constantly coming up with great ideas — and none of the rest of us seemed to realize it. She’s also the best friend I could ask for, especially Abby, since she’s just as organized and smart as I am.

That’s all I could say. I’d like to be able to say thank you, but I feel like I’m leaving out the good stuff. What was I thinking? Well, I’d like to say that my good humor was the inspiration for the best joke of all of us.

“Hi, Dawn!” I said. I made a beeline for the door. “We have a great idea,” I replied. “Take this brochure we found at the local hardware store. We’ll put it up on the back of a car or something. We’re going to have a big party in the back of a nice, comfortable old farmhouse.”

After I told my joke, Mary Anne came in. “Did you just spot me?” she asked.

“Yes,” I replied. “See? Mary Anne-chan was sitting at the wheel, thinking about this brochure we found on the wall in the old farmhouse. Her eyes were wide open, and she talked to herself, as if standing there with the whole thing in one place. Just as she was talking, the brochure came flying out of the brochure. It said, “This picture will please your room best! The easel, or something similar, will be great on your picture of Will Power.” You can see the pictures here before she began to think about what the easel might be.

Mary Anne started laughing. “You can’t get away from her,” she was saying. “She really is funny, though.”

“She’s funny, too,” said Stacey, laughing.

Well, maybe not so funny anymore. Anyway, Mary Anne was thinking about the brochure again and the pictures again and all of a sudden, what was the best thing to do about it? That’s exactly what Stacey said to me, so I thought maybe I’d do the same thing. I took the brochure out of the back of the car and opened the car door. “Well, it’s time to start planning a fabulous, fabulous night — party, day, or night ...”

“daydreaming party!” I said.

Abby looked at me with wide eyes. “What?”

I smiled politely, then started walking away holding the brochure in my hand.

“Then what!” Abby cried.

I shrugged. “I can never dream up a dream for you.<|endoftext|>
“A dream?” asked Claudia Kishi, who had already arranged the snacks in the special "special" category. “I don’t know. I don’t want to be a champion.” Claudia Kishi, whose family runs a publishing company in New York City, passed around a bowl of plain-buttermilk brown sugar with a sigh. “All right. Well, here’s the bowl. Sprinkle with sea salt, pepper, and pepperoni. Drizzle with orange zests.”

A piece I kept reading back and watching my friends toss in their Snack Hers with their Granola Duds couldn’t catch the sound of the gagging tube.

“You know who’d like to see in the cafeteria?” asked Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike as they slid into the cafeteria
