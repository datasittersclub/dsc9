. We could also make it happen. But we decided against it before we knew it. So now we have to go through the motions with Claudia and Abby! And we have to make sure we have the right ingredients — chocolate chips, paprika, salt, pepper, and peppermint bark — plus we have to have a huge supply of volunteer work.

So, that's the short list of steps that Kristy.com goes through. Now we can talk about it some more and talk about what we do. But first let me say that each of us is lucky to have a sitter in the club. I had a real hard time adjusting to her, and I guess my problem was that she was shy and very self-centered. But she manages to be so understanding.

Another member of the club, Logan, is an associate member, sort of a substitute that keeps us all together. He's been with the club for awhile now. You know, once a month when we're all out of school and everybody's home. Then he has a job. That's when we meet.

Claudia is the club's vice-president. She's totally bossy, and really takes it upon herself to keep us all in order. (She used to be one of my best friends, but then she went to college. She died a long time ago, while being a student at Stoneybrook's private school.) Claud has lots of fashion sense, though, which is why she's in the club.

In her spare time, Claudia, who usually puts on her makeup and stuff, likes to dress in strange, over-the-top clothes. She's wearing jeans, a sweater, a T-shirt, and a sweater. A little makeup, too, a little makeup. That's what she's great at. Her roomy style might be a little off-brand, but it makes her very entertaining. I was wrong about Claud not wearing the same kind of outfit just recently. She has braces and a large scar across her nose, though, and they're fixed. She's also allergic to things that are not supposed to be on the inside of her mouth: chocolate chips, milk, and cookies. Her housework is really contributing to her condition. She doesn't eat sweets, but she always gives herself a pill four out of five times a day.

Claud's a real dynamo. She can make you really think and dance with your hands, and she's the world's number-one creative spirit. So what can we expect from Claudia? Nothing.

But it's hard to tell when the words "Claud and I" or "I will be the first of the club" are in the mouth of another member of the BSC. Claudia and I are not the first kids for each other. Like Claudia and her twin sister, Janine, our family consists of an 85-year-old (Nicky) Bernese and a 65-year-old (Mal) Rutherford. And that brings us to us — the Junk Bucket, our newest addition.

Nicky (the BSC associate member) used to live next door to Claud, but then she went away for a while and ended up joining the Junk Bucket, which is a group of people who happen to be sort of exotic. They wear elaborate masks (their clothes have been around for a long time) and sometimes bring in their own items — jewelry, pottery, pottery-making. But for someone with her own set of talents and interests, Nicky certainly shines. She's a dynamo (even if she can manage to make one wrong turn and end up with an eye scar) and she loves mysteries, especially the ones about ghosts and the mysteries of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas.

Mal? She's not a fan of ghost stories, or of TV shows (the only ghost stories they know are mysteries they write, and I know you have heard that word already, which I'll explain later). She's the opposite of that, more into mysteries. So she's not really into people, unless it's a boy or a girl. She loves mysteries and ghost stories, too, and her interest in ghost stories grew out of two things that were in her mom's basement when she was a baby: The old adage, if anyone knows anything, he or she might want to read some. When her dad was found dead in his car, Mal and her two older brothers called the club the Underground. (We were the first members out loud.) Luckily for Mr. and Mrs. Thomas, the Underground wasn't an isolated case. There were also the strange and wonderful — from ghosts, from horses to books to horses—we each had to face.

The Underground was not exactly a new idea, however, which is why Mal's dad and I went on to be the first Baby-sitters Club members. In fact, Mal's mom and I grew up in a two
