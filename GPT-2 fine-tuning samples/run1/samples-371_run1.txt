 (“Hmmm,” Kristy said after we finished stuffing Oreos and putting our Oreos on Stacey’s table.)

We all looked at Kristy. Even Stacey knew that I’d be going to bed by then. I always make sure to arrive soon before I wake up, since I can go to sleep faster.<|endoftext|>
“Hi, you guys,” Mallory said as she poked her head into the room where Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike were sitting for their sixth and seventh grade class. “This afternoon I received a nice package that came in my room. It included a new pair of earrings I’d painted, stamped, and sewn onto earrings I’d made for Jessi. “That was neat, but the package never arrived because I forgot to check around the garage and couldn’t get it to find it.”

I saw Jessi standing in the rain outside her bedroom, trying to collect a piece of junk that she said had landed in her jacket pocket.

“Oh, good,” Jessi replied. “I have so many pieces of junk in the air.”

“I must have gone to the mall,” Jessi added, smiling at the old mall they’ve never been able to look at at least once a week. She’d also filled her purse with a pair of cheap sunglasses Jessi has only gotten a couple of dollars from me.

As I walked to the train station, I was a little worried. The bus was only half an hour away, so I knew I looked a little nervous. I was holding a flashlight against my shoulder. Just in case someone had shot a shot at my house, I turned to look.

“That’s great,” I said, taking another flashlight off my shoulder. The flashlight had only just dropped onto my rug when I glanced at the sun as it rose above the wheat fields in my bedroom.

“Yeah, that’s great. And it gives me another way to get to school,” I said excitedly. I checked my watch, which had just dropped into 90 seconds, then went to the lock. “I have to get my computer out of my uniform, okay?” I asked when the sun finally showed up, then put my hands behind my head.

Jessi looked worried at that, but she took a moment to look at me, then laughed. “I might get in an accident, Kristy. I mean, you can't put something like that on a flashlight. Besides, you can see the sky, so you hardly notice anything.” She smiled at me. “I really need a flashlight now, but I can’t really do anything.”

I missed that.

“Oh, I’ll come home,” I said thought Jessi. Even as I walked home, I looked back at the flashlight I had been holding for awhile. The sun was setting, and with it the darkness outside. I could see my house slowly turning gray. I was just about to turn back when I heard someone snoring around the corner.

“Oh, hey, Kristy,” I muttered. I closed my eyes. Our porch steps are closed on most days and we were just out of town. “Are you okay?”

“Yes,” told Kristy. She pulled the flashlight from her pocket and pointed it at the porch. As Kristy pointed the flashlight at me, my heart thudded loudly. It was the first flashlight I’d picked up that day. The first one I saw just then. It was hidden between the porch staircase and my room mirror. It had bright blue flashlights on it, blue neon lights, and a string of blue lights that were hanging from the top of my flashlight. I saw a huge rat, some green, hanging limp. I picked it up, turned off the flashlight, and walked to my mother’s bedroom to check on Kristy. Kristy had to be very careful not to let her get her flashlight too close to her mother. It might catch a ghost. I couldn’t be very sure when something big fell into Kristy’s backyard. She’d been afraid of it for a while. I got the red flashlight as well as both blue and green lights and a pair of long, heavy earrings. They were for my mom.

As I walked home, my dad called to say he’d be home from work at five-thirty for the next few hours. I walked right into his bedroom, closed my door, and closed the door behind me. I closed his door, too, and walked upstairs.
