 …” Claudia spoke up. “Don’t worry,” she said. “You know you just can. You’ll grow up.”

It was true. I’m about to tell her about the last time I ate potato chips. I was looking through the newspaper, when the phone rang. “It’s Mrs. Arnold. She needs a sitter for Thursday afternoon at 5:30 tomorrow afternoon.”

“Yes, it’s that time,” said Mrs. Arnold. “Mrs. Arnold has already told me who to call. She’d like me to take some baby-sitting work.”

“Take some,” I said.

Mrs. Arnold looked at me solemn. “What’s she thinking?”

“She’s thinking of a job,” said Claudia. “She’s thinking of a sitter.”


Kristy and Claudia looked at each other. Claudia, who seemed to be adjusting to the new environment, was already staring at me with narrowed eyes. My schedule had been changed to Thursdays and Fridays.

“What?” I said with a giggle. “I know you can call Mrs. Arnold when you need me around.”

“Exactly,” Mrs. Arnold said. “Mrs. Arnold is here for Thursday afternoon. You know, maybe she can take a few baby-sitting positions.”

“Thank you,” I said, feeling relieved. “I guess I can’t do anything else.”<|endoftext|>
"Well, maybe it’s time for our next meeting," said Kristy. "Claudia and I were thinking of something — a movie, for starters. The BSC, Kristy, Claudia, and I were in my room, meeting up with a bunch of friends."

"I guess it’s time to hang out," said Claudia. "I really can’t remember anything else. We can call your parents now."

Kristy turned to the others.

“Hi, Mal! Logan! Hi, Mrs. Kishi! Hi, Mary Anne.”

Mary Anne answered.

“Hello, Kristy? Hi, you guys.”

“Thanks,” said Kristy with a wave. “Well, maybe I’ll check with my mom or something. I guess it just means I have that meeting up in my room, anyway.”

Kristy smiled and gave Jessi her usual introduction: her name, address, and phone number, and then hung up. As they hung up she stopped talking.

"I hope so, Ms. Masters," Kristy said, "that we can relax a little and think about Mary Anne and Logan this week. I know we have a lot to think about."

She smiled at Jessi.

"Well, I guess not yet anyway," Kristy argued. “That’s all right. I think Mary Anne is getting used to Mary Anne, too. Plus, Dawn is coming with me. And Dawn is coming with Logan. But I haven’t had much time.”

Jessi shrugged. "Well, I want to spend most of the week with Kristy. Even though Nicky didn’t like us until we made out, or the next game would have turned out to be a big party, or things were going badly for Mary Anne."

“The last game had a major bad impact on Mary Anne’s life?” asked Mary Anne.

“No,” said Dawn. “It wasn’t the kind of emotional reaction you get when you experience a bad taste in your mouth. But I could tell it was a bad one, because it felt bad even though I knew I was being hurt.”

“But,” said Mary Anne, “I thought it had to have been pretty awful for me.”

“You can call that a negative,” said Dawn, sounding sad. “Of course. How could it have been worse?”

“All my life,” said Kristy.

“Oh, you’ll never understand my brain,” told Mary Anne.

“What do you mean negative?”

Mary Anne looked up. “I mean, negative is good. As we try to find an acceptable new thing for Mary Anne to do, you know, for the next lot of friends, you guys, you might try to do something less negative. So-
