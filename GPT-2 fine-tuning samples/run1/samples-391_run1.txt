 thing to the mall, because I don’t think it’s all there. (My parents don’t approve of Stoneybrook’s mall.) But when the sun came out, and the sun went up really fast, my parents couldn’t stop celebrating.

The end of the meeting was about to start. Kristy was talking about the game between the boys, and Stacey came in with the announcement: she hoped the BSC members would go bowling. Mallory said she hoped they would drive me to a bowling clinic. Claudia said she hoped the BSC members would have a BSC notebook. I looked up the BSC in the BSC notebook, discovered that it actually has a title, and a lot of good ideas. There are thirteen members, and in the notebook the members describe their favorite activities. This notebook is good if you are reading an author-illustrator of a book, or you want to write about babies without actually writing it up. The BSC also has a central number of rules that we set for ourselves. We don’t advertise; we don’t forbid junk food, or break rules, or make rules about who can and canle what after dinner. That kind of thing.

When the meeting began, our phone rang three times. Jessi was ready, she had her notebook in hand when the meeting was over, and she would be there to take calls. She’d already booked three jobs that day at the mall, and by five minutes she was ready to start answering the phone. She hung up quickly, because we weren’t sure if she’d take down a call or not. That was a lot of work, but it was still a good sign when I called her right over again.

“Kristy, wake up!” called Mary Anne.

I hung up the phone and made my way over to Stacey.

“Kristy!” I said slowly.

Kristy looked up from the notebook the moment she finished. “What is it about?”

“It’s a great book.” I replied. “How can I help?”

“I’m not sure, but I’m looking forward to it.”

“I’ll read it,” she said uncertainly. (I’d read the book already, but not too closely.) She listened carefully, since it would be fun to read about different breeds of cabbies.

Stacey and I discussed the book a lot. We discussed which of us should be on the Baby-sitters Club. And finally, we asked ourselves how much work there would be. In case we weren't clear, here it goes. I’m the club president. I love organizing meetings and meeting times. I have lots of official duties, such as scheduling and paying dues. The club also has a publishing business that goes out of its way to keep up with digital books coming out. So those are my official duties.

But Stacey wasn’t really sure whether to get the book out to the public or wait it out. She looked around the room, trying to decide which one she thought was the more important one. Then she said “I’m going shopping.”

“What?” I asked.

“Claudia’s not shopping, I’m buying a book,” she replied, interrupting. We hung up the phone.

“Kristy, you’re going to buy a book and I know you’re going to call that number,” Jessi insisted.

“Who wants to buy a book?” Kristy asked.

“An ad in a fashion magazine,” I explained. I’d been born and raised in New York City. Kristy doesn’t live there, though. She and I grew up here in Stoneybrook, across the street from Claudia. In New York we grew up as a couple, on the Upper East Side. Until recently we were on the Upper West Side, which meant that there were lots of Upper West Side neighborhoods, but then the administration moved here and we lived here for awhile. Then we moved, too, back to the City of New York, where we moved to.

I have to say that while Stacey and Claud might be different, what they have in common is a wide variety of interests. Stacey studies ballet and is good at it. She loves to do odd jobs, and she has plenty of experience. Claud, meanwhile, is in the music business, although she has little money, so she stays far away from noisy children and her violin. For many years she was the only boy in her family
