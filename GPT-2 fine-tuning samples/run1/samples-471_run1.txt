======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a job in Stoneybrook but has no children. She lives with her mom, who recently took stepsister and stepbrother, to a new, more mature phase in her life. She met Watson Brewer, who, just recently, moved from California to live with him. (Now Mrs. Thomas lives in Stoneybrook.) The Thomases began to get along so well that they recently bought a house across town and are now good friends.

"Betsy and I are the oldest club members. She’s seven, she’s got two kids, and she and I are eleven. We like each other, and we enjoy being around one another very much. But I don’t think being a thirteen-year-old is a good thing at all." Kristy held up the record book and noted the ages of the members. "Kristy, I think you’ll see some change now at Stoneybrook Middle School."

I smiled triumphantly, but she shook her head. Kristy, on the other hand, is very direct and personal and will never be like me. I don’t think her family has been treated too lenhetically from one moment to the next. Their main cause is Claud’s asthma, which isn’t a disease that she suffers. No doubt she will be the subject of a new classically hairdo-wearing art lesson someday.

“Hello, Claud,” Kristy announced her sixth grade class, which consisted of her little sister, Janine, and her parents and assorted older siblings. They sounded pretty happy about Kristy’s coming class, but Janine couldn’t believe her older sister. She was having problems with them, too. Janine had a really bad asthma attack and kept coughing. And she is the world’s least controllable wimp. Janine also has a bad case of diabetes, which happens when her body can’t keep pace with Claud’s. This is a pretty serious disease, but Janine takes great care to keep it under control and to get rid of it as soon as she can.

“That looks like a great dress for you, Claud,” Kristy had said. Then she looked away, and the rest of the members had to scramble around in their costumes.

“All right!” Kristy said.

Kristy, who is president of the BSC, is the one who figured out the basic idea for Stoneybrook Middle School. She thought of it that way: The idea was to make the whole school more like a private school. This is no easy project. There’s a little-kids project, involving a group of volunteers from time to time. But the main good thing about Stoneybrook Middle School is that it meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon from five-thirty until six. On those days it’s a breeze (or no breeze). The school is organized more around a single school function. For starters, Stacey doesn’t have to coach a team to run the things she does (so to speak) every day. She just takes classes. Then there’s the snacks. She keeps things simple and straightforward. When I’m on a team or a little kids' team, it saves me having to do the whole day.

Kristy’s organization was also Kristy’s. She’d been a club member since before Kristy could even be in her thirties. It came to her as a surprise when we were invited to the BSC meetings. We were a BSC idea for lunch, and before Kristy could ask why she was being pulled into the Krushers’ practice, she started talking about it. Then, shortly after that, the Ramseys’ football team. Kristy was still a club idea.

“I don’t really know the Ramseys right now, Stacey, but I know they’ve got some charges out there who are in the Ramsey family, but I don’t think they know me.”

“I’ll try to,” Stacey announced.

“But I’ll be there,” Dawn suggested, and Kristy began to begrudgingly accept it. “You know, I have this fear that this could be a good meeting for a rival party to attend this summer.”

And I know what would happen! “I’ll be there?” Kristy cried. “The Ramseys and the Pike kids won’t be too happy when we get to a new summer camp.<|endoftext|>
By five-twenty the first day of school was complete, and the first thing that came to mind was my two brothers and sisters
