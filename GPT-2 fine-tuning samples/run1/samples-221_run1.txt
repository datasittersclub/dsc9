 all so, is that the president is president; he acts as treasurer of our club, but he doesn't sit for weekends.

Mary Anne and Dawn are very different about jobs. For instance, Dawn lives with her father whenever she can since she has been here so long. Dawn has never taken a sitting job other than driving her dad from town to town. So Mary Anne was her chosen for the BSC. Dawn has blonde hair, freckles and braces. Like Mary Anne, she has a pet project: a book of cat-and-mouse rules for her kittens.

Mary Anne is our alternate officer. We use her as our vice-president. I don't know if you could call her that, but she manages to do most of our jobs without anyone else doing it.

When we were in the eighth grade, Mary Anne and her older sister were born in this house next door to Mrs. Thomas. Their parents got divorced a long time ago and Mrs. Thomas moved Mary Anne across town to live with them. We also moved into this new house that was the exact opposite from our old one. Mary Anne came from a smaller family, yet all that changed when Mary Anne was in seventh grade. Now she has two older sisters; a baby brother named David Michael (who is seven now) and two baby stepsiblings called Abby and Tiffany.

Abby and Tiffany live with their dad a whole lot. They also live with their mother but don't talk to her until they are almost two months old. They are Mary Anne's little brothers and sisters.

Now let me tell you something about the family, since it's my family.

For a long time, my mom and I used to dress alike. We were pretty pretty (my dad would treat us like sisters just as if there was some kind of secret club), but then Abby was born and Dawn was born. I guess I look a little like Abby. She has brown hair and brown eyes, and she has pierced ears and long black hair. Abby and her friends call them "little sisters." This is the main reason they're so popular with the kids they baby-sit for. They have different personalities. Abby would be the one to kiss someone and say, "Ohhh, it was Dawn." She could also yell, "Oh, you guys are so sweet!" (which she does now, since she can only speak up when she thinks someone might be mean to her.)

Dawn and Abby both wear jeans, a T-shirt that says, "Fashionable Outfit," and a sweater underneath it that says, "Look Good," a picture of a dog under it. Abby and her sisters usually wear babyish-looking outfits and wear babyish clothing that doesn't go the extra mile.

Abby has curly blonde hair and blue eyes, along with a big family. Sometimes she cries when she gets a phone call or a baby-sitter calls. Abby is the most perfect baby-sitter, though. She has had her own baby-sitting experience so far and she has really taken it.

In addition to being perfect, Abby's mind is crazy. She is the only white person in the school. She is crazy about math, too. She loves subjects like astronomy and astrophysics. Her love of cats is also a big influence on her.

She is the oldest black student in the seventh grade and it is surprising that she has not been an honorary member since seventh grade. But you could say a nonwhite girl has not met hers very well.

And that's not even counting the ones who had to hide at the beginning. Before we told you about Claudia, that's just the way the BSC work. We always tell people that Claudia is vice-president because she has a private phone line but also because she has her own room, with a queen-sized bed and a secret passageway.

Since her room is secret — and probably used for too long to keep track of — it's not surprising that she is the first black student to enter the club. Claudia, like Kristy Thomas, is smart. She has a BSC notebook, a pencil and marker, and she's also terrific on the math department. She writes in the notebook how we're doing, and tells us how to solve problems. She is also a math whiz. If anyone was ever bored or upset about a problem she could solve with the help of Claudia, it was her; she solved it right after supper, then went back to the bathroom at about eleven. She knows what to say and do.

Claudia lives in the club headquarters, the one inside Claudia’s room, and doesn’t come often. But she’s a very practical, experienced math whiz. She’s also the eighth-grader in all of seventh grade. At seventh grade, she and her brothers won’t be allowed to bring
