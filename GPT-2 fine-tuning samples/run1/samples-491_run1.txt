 collect her artistry.

And she’s not the only one in Stoneybrook who does that. Our club dues pay for some of the things Abby has to take care of every day, and Kristy helps me out a lot. So Abby is very important to the club and I think that’s why we run it as a business.

We’re so close to Stacey, especially since Kristy and Abby have sort of been sisters since we were babies. We’re very different in some ways, but we are pretty close as sisters. We’re both very, very quiet and pretty good friends with a few things in common (besides our love of reading Nancy Drew books, and we’ve been known to play music together).

Our club also has a record book, in which we keep count of all of our jobs. We maintain a club record book with client information, info on our appointments and finances, a club-page with our schedules, and a calendar with our jobs.

Our record book doesn’t sound all that complicated, but it’s pretty handy for keeping track of everyone’s schedule. Claudia, Jessi, Stacey, and Mallory are all club members because they happen to be my best friends, whom I feel are the most sophisticated girls in the world. Also because they are absolute best friends. They’ve taken charge of everything I go to, whether it’s my ballet class, an art class, or a sitting job.

Jessi and Logan (Jessi’s the other member of the BSC) are our junior officers. They’re eleven and in sixth grade. They’re good at all kinds of things, from ballet classes to zoos to zoos for the animals. They aren’t allowed to sit alone at night yet, since Kristy is strict about night-time dress. Jessi doesn’t have her own private bedroom, since she has her own family and her own boyfriend, Byron (he’s cute, but he’s a little weird). She does, however, have a stepfather and a kitten she adores. Her life has not been easy. Not long ago, her mother died on a long, long road with Jessi and Logan. The last time I looked, the days were filled with joy and excitement, followed by depression and despair. Jessi’s mother hardly made enough money, so the family split up. Fortunately, Stacey had the help of Dawn, the Bat Mitzvah volunteer, and Dawn returned.

Dawn is not only a pretty, experienced BSC member (she’s from Washington, D.C.), she’s from California. She and her twin sister, Anna, moved to Stoneybrook mostly because their parents were in the West Coast. After the split up, the Ramseys went back to California to live with their dad.

So there you have all the main characters of the BSC: Kristy, Mary Anne, Stacey, Claudia, and Stacey. I hope I’m clear on what you’ve missed.

1. Bart Taylor. He just happens to be the only guy in the club.

2. “Order, sir!”

A couple of minutes later, the phone rang again. This time it was to Kristy, who was still clutching a bag of chips.

“Hello Mrs. Barrett?” Kristy was saying when the phone started to ring again. “I’ve got a business call that the BSC is calling about.” Since we were still only a Monday magazine, this time Kristy was best placed to answer the phone. “Kristy, this is Mal.”

“Kristy, this is Kristy Barrett who is our club secretary.” Kristy answered the phone and held out her hand. “I’ve just discovered an interesting new art project called sculpture. It began as a dream come true for an Art Director on the family we were attending school in Stamford, but has been going on for a while now. Instead of making a sketch or an original piece of art, you were going to put together a series of sculptures in front of a mirror to make your own image. The process takes a lot of practice and creativity. It sounds simple, but it’s really not. I was hoping it would give me some inspiration. Kristy has a great idea for a project and it always works. You see the beauty in it. She even thought up the idea for the BSC, which is to have a club that would be fair to all of us in some sense in which to judge one another.

Kristy is a great secretary. She’s not only organized, she’s also organized and quick
