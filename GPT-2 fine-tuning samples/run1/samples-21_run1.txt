 replied, "That's a great idea!"

"So what?" asked Jack from on high.

"Don't tell anyone about that little girl."

"She'll find out later, isn't she?"

"Very, very," said Jack, still wearing his glasses. "I mean, don't tell anyone about her. She doesn't seem to have a boyfriend."

I was still smiling. Maybe that was how I began.

"Hey, you've seen her!"

I had to be careful with my mouthpiece. When I saw some baby-sitting kids we had at the pool, we hurried to help them.

They looked happy. They smiled. "Hello!" they cried. "Welcome to the Club," I said.

"Hello," said Mr. Thomas.

"Good-bye, baby," said Mrs. Thomas.

Mr. Thomas let me see the baby. And then he smiled, too.

"Hello, baby!" said Mr. Thomas, and he said, "You sure do look adorable!"

I had two eyes, too, and one that stared at her. I wasn't sure how much of a cute thing she was, or how big the rest of us were.

I decided to give him a try. I pulled my arm around the little guy and whispered. "Hello, baby," said Mr. Thomas.

This baby-sitter was the one who got him to sit next to Mary Anne, who was sitting alone in bed, her arms stretched a little wider. She was sitting there in the bed. Her hair was long and red, her makeup perfect. Her nose was always black. Her lips were so wide, so silky that she looked like the sun.

I pulled the arm around her and kissed her cheek.

"What the hell are you doing here?" I asked.

She turned to me and, as if to say, "Oh, hello, baby," and smiled. Mr. Thomas held her up to me.

"You know, Baby-sitter John's an absolute legend," I said.

Aww, Baby!

"Oh, I see," Mrs. Thomas said.

"We all know, baby," I agreed, smiling. "We've all been with him in the last few years."

The baby-sitters were all giggling and saying nice things about Mr. Thomas, too.

"Hello, baby!" we called out to him.

"That looks very sad," said Mr. Thomas. He looked at me. "It's been over seven days since his appointment," he said, then said, "Mr. Thomas and Mr. Thomas are really a great club. We've been to four games and nobody was ever a bigger draw than we were."

"That!" I exclaimed at that last comment.

He looked at us. Mr. Thomas smiled. "Hi, baby!" he said as we left.

"Oh, baby-sitter," I shouted.

"You are such a great club friend, baby!" I exclaimed.

I had to be careful with my mouthpiece. I had to look at the baby-sitters. Mrs. Thomas was wearing high-heeled, slinky boots. She was very feminine and very athletic. She had an elegant face and great, smooth shoulders. She used to draw people to join her club — to my knowledge, she hasn't had any clients since I got my first appointment the other day. In fact, her clients are all white.

Mrs. Thomas was dressed in a gorgeous pink-and-teal blouse and jeans that looked as much as a baby-sitter pair. They fit a perfect combination because they sat in her room. She was pretty smart too, and she had great sense of smell. She wore nothing but sneakers, jeans, and a black tank top. She used to carry a bag of tissues and food on her private walks.

If they weren't gorgeous, they would be a real challenge — too hot. We decided to get Mary Anne, who I had taken to this club three times before. Mary Anne wore the same high heels and skinny jeans I wear. She also has a baby face. (You'd think she'd look a little boyish in a high-heeled high-top, but she looks a little boyish in a baby outfit to begin with. And she wears a little something in it too.)

Mary Anne wore all the same glasses, high-heeled boots, and black jeans: she also wore a black pencil.

I had to be careful with my mouthpiece. The baby-sitters were so gorgeous. They looked a lot like the baby-sitters who make up our Club. For example, Mary Anne and I have a baby-sitters club of
