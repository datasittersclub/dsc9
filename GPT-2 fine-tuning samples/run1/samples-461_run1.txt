 be a big leap for a human being. To begin with, she’s a terrific dancer. She can jump at any moment and get away with it. Not even Dawn has the legs to do it. She’s a natural athlete, and she does the things she wants to do. But she doesn’t go to the gym, and she doesn’t do any stretching. And she doesn’t eat junk food. That’s because she needs it.

So why is Watson so jealous? Well, he thinks she should go back to the boarding school where she’d been raised. When her parents got divorced, Mrs. Thomas moved Watson and his brother, Jeff, to Watson’s new farm. The two of them remarried, and the Thomases now live in Watson’s mansion. Mr. Watson calls Mrs. Thomas half his life into himself.

Another reason Watson is jealous is because he doesn’t like Mary Anne’s privacy. Mary Anne and Abby have become good friends, and Mary Anne thinks Watson is jealous because the Thomases used to date. But they didn’t stop him from dating any girl. Mary Anne had been living a different life until she moved back to California — in part because Mrs. Perkins began to divorce. The divorce was really too much for her, and she quit the BSC.

Now Mary Anne is totally open to Mary Anne’s involvement in all things BSC, since she grew up in Stoneybrook. She still has her father's permission to live, and she likes being part of an integrated community. (See how romantic the BSC nickname is?)

Claudia Kishi is more formal and less bossy than Claudia or Janine. For one thing, she is a serious student. And as club secretary she keeps a close eye on all seven members. She also likes to write and draw, and she gives it up pretty easily.

Claudia takes the BSC seriously, too. She’s the only one of us who does both daytime and nighttime sitting jobs. She likes being the club secretary, and she often thinks of new ways to keep the club running.

Mary Anne is the only other club member who goes to college. She earned her doctorate last year, but she missed her home city and school so much that she stayed in her original hometown, New York City. Now she’s back, but she’s used to her new life in Manhattan and the cool shops in the city.

Claud was also the first member of the club to move away. Mary Anne has two younger sisters who used to live in New York City, but they moved here after her parents got divorced. (Claudie was a great person to come to a meeting for, I guess, to see her through her divorce!)

Nowadays, Mary Anne’s family consists of her father, her mother, and her younger brothers and sisters. Mary Anne can barely remember any of them, but she’s used to her dad’s work, which is mainly because Mary Anne’s mom left when Mr. Spier’s company transferred its janitorial staff from New York to Long Island. So Mary Anne has to work hard to be left behind.

Claudia is not only an inspiration to everyone around her, but she’s also the only member of the club who has a steady boyfriend. His name is Clayton and he’s cute. He’s from Louisville, Kentucky, and he’s on the football and baseball groups, and he has an awesome sense of humor. (He even wears glasses.)

Claud isn’t the world’s best student yet, but he has a funny face and he always knows when to turn the corner and check the corner again. He likes sports. You should see how he handles being pulled over for a traffic stop. I can see the world ending soon if he’s around.

“Hi, everybody!” came the call from the phone. The four of us continued on forward, and as we were about to leave Claudia checked her teeth carefully. The phone rang three times, and then the meeting ended.

It was very nice to see that Claudia and Mary Anne were still talking and laughing. But the rest of us were just walking around the house, chatting, about what had happened that day.

“I guess you got the whole mess straight away,” Mary Anne began, passing me a bag of pretzels.

“No,” said Claudia quickly. “It’s not that bad. I mean, the whole mess that’s been going on lately is almost as much deception as it is real problem solving. We’re not in the least bit guilty for thinking we’
