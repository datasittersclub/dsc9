======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Besides a new friend from high school whom I’m sure I wouldn’t describe as “mature” until I hit college, Dawn moved to California and brought her two kids with her: her mother and her younger brothers, Jeff and me. Dawn was ecstatic, but when I first arrived she looked as if she had walked into the eighth grade hall, and I thought she might as well be a seventh-grader. Then she started to act much more grown-up than we knew she had or could do. Dawn’s love, her hobbies, her babyaring, everything. Oh, and she has a big, awful, dreaded disease: diabetes. That’s a terrible (and very serious) disease in which the body doesn’t break down when certain foods or nutrients are in them (foods that the body doesn’t make naturally). That means if you take an afternoon jog every day, you could get very sick. Dawn’s has cured her of it, and she’s still in the hospital, but with or without insulin. (Diabetes is a form of scoliosis, a curvature of the spine.)

Dawn had just wound up in the Baby-sitters Club, what with her two older brothers, Jeff and me — and Dawn’s sweetest puppy, a gray one named Shannon (yes, Dawn’s real name is Sharon.) Dawn’s sweet and shy and sensitive. Okay, you’re thinking she’s a little immature, but she’s very sensitive, and cries easily. I think that pride made her cry a lot.

Anyway, Dawn had called the meeting to order, and when we were sure it’d come to order, Kristy reminded us about the Janine Kishi bill we had heard so much about. (The Janine family is Japanese-American, and Kristy’s family has European-American roots.)

"Isn’t it interesting that their bill says they’re certified as having diabetes? What kind of responsibility do they have to keep track of every single meal they have to eat?" Kristy continued. "Diabetes is not a health problem; it’s a personal — and — responsibility. Stacey is responsible for collecting and keeping track of every single thing she eats, and Mary Anne, since she’s the treasurer, is responsible for keeping track of the money the treasury collects. Each of us has a share of that money, of course. But it's very important to collect, to report the total money we earn to the Kishi family, and to contribute toward keeping track of the bills of sale. That’s how we come up with some of the lists."

Of the eight lists, only three have to do with anyone except Mary Anne, and not Stacey or Kristy. In fact, we always meet at Claudia’s. That’s because she and Kristy once worked as a rival for the same position at the New York City Public Library. Claudia was so overworked that her parents were afraid to bring her up to become a prima-and-pancil just so she could keep jobs at the library. (That’s how the Connecticut branch of the Public Eye got its name.)

That’s how the BSC first became a family. Our parents used to try to stop us from doing things their way. Everybody hates us now. But all the opposites attract. In the beginning, when I was just a toddler, being a big brother and sister was very, very difficult. I couldn’t go to a nice school, or go to seventh grade. I had to hide in my room (as usual), wait for Daddy to come home from work, and keep a journal. Every day I had to call him, collect his money, and make sure he’d get out of my life. Not only that, I had to start a new one every day. And that was too hard. Now my mother is married again, and I’ve got a new stepfather, Watson Brewer, and a lot of new friends. They call him Sam, but they don’t mean Sam Welles. He’s five feet five, in fact. But I grew up on the short side of him, with a capital B. He is, in fact, crazy good. So are my older brothers, Charlie and Sam. Welles’s big ears and his extreme athletic ability (he was a two-sport athlete at heart) made for a good baby-sitter. Also, he was raised by a single parent.

Welles and Sam didn’t get along very well, until after a long, hard time was had in the family for which they had to struggle at first. Welles’s dad just walked out on the family, leaving
