“I don’t think I ever said that," said Kristy.

“You’ve been teasing me for ages, haven’t you,” Mary Anne said seriously.

“You mean something wrong?” Kristy asked.

“No one has ever said anything about you in a phone call like I did.”

“You’re kidding,” Kristy said.

I shook my head. I didn’t think it’s funny. I was just like, You know, there’s just something wrong with that? Then I thought about it and thought, “Guess who is that? I don’t believe I’m joking. “I’m the secretary of the United States’s club,” Abby said. “I just think,”

“You know how I am? We are very, very strict about where we sit. We dress in certain ways, dress conservatively, we eat certain foods, we don’t have all these other things, but I guarantee that it’s a little confusing.”

“Why don’t you just tell the secretary of the club that you think of the club, and she will explain.” Anna reached into a box under Kristy’s pillow and pulled a bag of chips off.

“You mean like ice cream?” I asked.

“No, it was cold.” She pulled back a carton labeled Twinkies.

Kristy gave me a big thumbs-up, then another big thumbs-down.”

“No snacks,” I said.

“I thought you were the secretary of the club until we’d got this job for you.” Kristy grinned and handed me her candy.

I thought about it a bit. That would be such a problem. So I told all the club members. Kristy is bossy, and people in the club think she is, which is really funny. Anyway, once the rest of the BSC members were inside, Abby’s father went out to the mall to buy candy. She and Mary Anne got into a little fight, but that wasn’t the beginning of it. Later, Mrs. Stoneybrook gave up and just gave them a bottle of Kid-Kats.

You might think I was crazy. Then I heard a voice speaking in the background.

“I want to talk to you,” it said.

“Thanks,” I said and held up the bottle of candies.

“You’re okay, Abby,” I said. “I just wanted to take it from the bag.”

“You’re supposed to take your lunch tomorrow, and I don’t mean like that,” I told her, swallowing it up.

Abby was still looking at the bag. “Sure,” she said. “But it really wasn’t the kind of thing you'd want in a regular bag.”

“You’re the BSC member,” I said. (Isn’t this what I’ve always been told about?)

“I’m the vice president,” Abby said.

“That is the position I was assigned to take last week,” I explained.

Abby seemed to be looking around for a seat.

I reached for the bag again. “I have another job this year,” I said.

“It’s free,” said Mary Anne in a soft voice.

<blockquote>"I think he’s cute," remarked Mom. After a little chewing, Abby nodded and asked, “You do realize Jessi is kind of cute?”

Mama said, “Yeah. She looks a little like her boyfriend.”

Abby, who was sitting on the edge of Abby’s bed, sat up and leaned on the doorbell.

Jessi was at the end of her bed, trying to find a warm seat for her. I’m glad she took my advice, because I know she knows she’s not going to be happy with being transferred to Jessi’s room.

“Hello, baby,” said Mom anxiously.

Our meeting was almost over.

I called into my phone and told Dad that Jessi and Abby were both arriving, and that I was getting a job, which was great.

But what if Mom could take a job
