. She never complains about sitting or any of that stuff. I hate to tell you the truth, though. She was never a good leader. The only way she knows how is if she's constantly getting too busy. When Jessi was the BSC secretary, she had to make two phone calls per day between jobs. One of them was to take Kristy's phone call, then call back back the alternate number. When it came on in the middle of the day it was almost ten-four again and Kristy had to replace it with a different alternate number. This took a lot of scheduling trouble for Kristy.

Stacey got the job of director of the BSC a day after Stacey was transferred back to the office. That was probably because of the phone call Stacey made all the way back to California. She was in California too because, after the phone line left, Mallory had moved to New York to take a job there with the BSC. And because there was a lot of phone call and plenty of slack, Stacey, at least, stayed home. She's our alternate officer (although I think her mom thinks it's a mistake to tell her they have to call Stoneybrook in three and a half days to replace her). I always tell her I'm not that busy. Mallory says I'm usually free by that time. We even have a few things to do while our charges are out; Kristy's not happy with that, though, so she tries to think up a plan that'll work. We brainstorm ideas and find ways to make time for new clients. We even try to find a new BSC sitter at once. Kristy is an excellent brainstormer and I think she'd be a good BSC member if she met Jessi and Stacey.

"Well, I guess it's all over, I guess," Kristy said finally, reaching for the phone for Stacey and putting it down.

"No problem. You're still available."

Kristy took out her hand. "Here's a note. It says this isn't an appointment — I'm in California but I'm not available right now. What you need is some help."

"Oh," said Jessi, turning to see what she'd lost. "You guys have a little business. I know you're all mad," she announced. "I bet you would be if I was on your case, though, weren't you?"

"I bet," said Stacey, nodding.

"Are you all worried about the kids?" Jessi asked as soon as Stacey pulled the top off her headband.

"Yeah," me and the others agreed. "I bet you were concerned. You're always having kids, and I doubt if you're ready for them to get into school. But you don't seem to care about them too much." Jessi was grinning. It sounded so great.

Stacey shook her head. She was wearing her brown hair in a long, straight line. "Maybe you should think about running away," she said, her voice sharp.

"Oh, good. I bet you just might. I sure would like a family of my own. And if you take me back to the day, I could see myself living there with the rest of you."

"Okay," said Jessi.

"Okay," agreed Jessi.

"Okay," Kristy agreed, holding up a folded paper bag, then tossing it on the bed. "I'm not done yet."

"So you mean you can send me over to the boarding house?" I asked.

Jessi giggled. "Yes."

"You two are going to be late," I replied.

"Yeah," said Jessi. "I'd better have more time if I was here instead of at home. I'd rather be alone than there."

"Oh!" said Mallory, jumping out of her seat. "You can send me over to the BSC for some rest."

"And you will," said Stacey.

"Okay," replied Jessi, turning around.

I watched Mallory pull the bag back over her headband. There was an instant of quiet. Suddenly, I started running. We looked at each other and I saw no one moving as the BSC busied itself with holding the kids.

"You're running, aren't you?" Mallory asked, taking her baby brother.

"Okay," I told Jessi. I ran into the bus. I ran into the hall. I ran into the library. I ran into the zoo. I ran into the club. It was five-thirty. I ran into the club. But I had to stop just because my phone rang. …

I ran, and a second later the bus came. The BSC bus was coming right into the hall
