======== SAMPLE 1 ========

Kristy wants the club to be more like Stoneybrook Middle School, the one-stop shop that let you try to understand a bunch of kids, solve problems, even make friends.

We must admit, Mary Anne and I are two different styles. We haven't been around much school games yet, but I can appreciate those two styles having a time.

Stacey McGill lives a few blocks away, in the house which Kristy originally bought a year ago. (I think. Kristy has a whole new neighborhood to herself, and Stacey's family lives in my neighborhood, too.)

Stacey says she's white because she doesn’t identify with her color. I don’t know how she knows this. Even though she’s cute and unique, I don’t really understand Stacey. And as I mentioned, I don’t understand dating. I don’t like relationships, but dating is easy at first. Especially dating when they’re really, really serious.

Here are the steps I was on when I first moved here:

1) See what I mean? See what I mean?

2) Find a nice guy.

3) Get married.

4) See if I think of something I like.

5) Plan a date for sometime.

I would leave town fast for a while, since I’d be gone for eight whole days while I waited. Then I’d have so much time on my hands.

And I guess it would work out because I would be home so early that I would have been better at meeting new people.<|endoftext|>
“This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club will now come to order,” said Kristy. "Where now?”

The room flew into a whirling roar.

Everyone groaned. Kristy and Stacey had been such a whirlwind of business that it was almost time for the meeting to start.

As president, Kristy is very organized. In fact, it’s one of her great strengths. She does all the things one would expect of an organized person: she organized a bowling alley; she organized a softball field; she organized a softball team for little kids; she organized a softball field trip to the beach with her dad, brother, best friend, and assorted assorted other friends.

And I’m not even kidding. Her father had died in a car accident a few years ago. (Kristy’s mom still lives in the house I had driven across the street from.) She had to raise this family out of diapers, clothes, toys and onto the move.

Kristy is president because she can figure out rules without resorting to the brats. It’s also because she’s organized, and because she is a whiz. She knows how to keep things organized — just like she knows how to make a good idea happen without resorting to the brat.

To get to the heart of it, Kristy was trying so hard to keep a clean bill of health at the meeting. First things first. A meeting of the BSC would start at five-thirty sharp. I took the stairs, and Kristy, Stacey and Dawn followed me. Stacey and Kristy’s friend Dawn are the ten members of the club, and they are junior officers. One member was out front in a scrumptious suit and the other was sitting cross-legged on a canvas bed, next to Dawn.

Kristy and the rest of us were gathered around her. Claudia was perched cross-legged on a desk chair in her room, while Stacey perched on the edge of an old suitcase. Mal and Jessi were in the director’s chair, while Abby, who is Kristy’s best friend, sat on the floor near the edge of the bed.

I crossed the aisle at Claudia’s house and went inside. It was a good ten minutes before my alarm went off — the club meeting was nearly over.

The meeting adjourned then, but not before I mentioned the news to Mary Anne.

“You asked about the new clients,” said Kristy, “but we’re not doing our usual business. It’s three-thirty. We’re going to Stoneybrook again.”

Jessi and Mal shook their heads and looked relaxed. Kristy didn’t answer directly. Instead they leaned against Claudia’s wall and whispered, “We’re going to meet again.”

“Yeah. It will be great.” “The old days,” said Kristy. “You’re used to it. How many baby-sitters
