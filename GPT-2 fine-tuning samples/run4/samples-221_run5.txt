 myself but you know, “It’s okay.” Kristy said as they walked into a small, quiet community where a lot of people live. She used to live that kind of neighborhood, but I thought I had it covered. We walked into the community and a group of people were taking care of kids.

“Well, you know one of them can’t help it,” said a blonde kid, “because his brother, who is in another class,” “is a diabetic.” He was taking a lot of medications so he can’t take full advantage of the help he has, even though everyone else is dealing with it. But the group of kids were all getting very cranky, and I thought it was a good idea to give them some exercise. Then the group started taking care of the kids.

That was when I thought about becoming president. Now that I’m in the job, I am not that person. You see, I am an executive who can be bossy. That’s pretty healthy for a club of children. But as I have said before, if something went too far, it’s okay with me or not.

One thing I don’t like about myself, in my opinion, is that I am an average sort of person. Maybe I was not used to being president that way (laughs). Anyway, I wasn’t too worried about me when I met this guy who seemed to know more about me than I did. It was Robert. Remember that? He’s like a secretary. He’s always ready to take a call about something, like dinner, just when the clients need a seat. Sometimes he could even be the perfect sitter.

That’s what he did for us. For example, Kristy asked us to take a baby-sitting job at Robert’s house because we were starving. (Kristy never did say this was a good idea. She only said we had to make a hard choice, like taking her back to her room just because she had to go through a procedure for cramping.) After that we decided to try taking Robert to the doctor. Robert has this really tough time with his diabetes, partly because he has to watch us every day. So he has to be very careful. Also, when the kids are sick, he can't really take care of them. In addition to that, he has to watch for allergies and allergies and other things like that. Also, he has to be careful not to get him too close to children. Kristy says that in the club, Robert is the most organized person. Even though he has to be a lot of help, she believes he can work really well.

One thing I think parents who know Kristy better than any other individual at the beginning of every meeting would like in order to help them is to know how she feels about the kids they babysit. I think Kristy is sensitive about the fact that she had to be a baby-sitter. For a long time, she didn’t know what was best for her baby. After all, it was not just her family. Kristy has to do an awesome job in order to do okay. I think her parents would have liked that she was the one to pick all the kids for their children.

By that time I heard what Kristy thought — that Kristy was beginning to think she was the hardest kid in school. I know that she’d wanted to be a full-fledged first-grader, but she was so overwhelmed by school she couldn’t even think through the rest of the day. Then, when the other kids realized that she was being too sensitive, Kristy’s parents began to understand. Now Kristy likes to make sure the kids she babysits aren’t kids she was grown-up for. For her, that meant not doing anything fun until the parents needed it a little more much.

Now to be clear, I understand the need for Kristy to be cool, but I don’t think I’m the only one who sees Kristy as difficult. Also, I think they’ll notice what happens when she gets to know some of the other kids in the school. I see Kristy getting a little more organized, like when her parents want her to join their club.

“Just so you know,” said Karen, who is taking over the BSC. “I like what I saw happen. When Kristy was in kindergarten, I saw her at a ball about five-thirty. She was wearing her red jeans, red-and-white sneakers, and a long, long sweater and high-top beanies, and her hair was in this curly, curly, wispy motion. And I think that when you look at her
