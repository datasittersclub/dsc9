. I knew she was gorgeous, but I didn’t think she’d ever have the chance. The more I thought about it, I’d also thought about the fact that Shannon could’t come to meetings. The reason was that Shannon was a newcomer to Stoneybrook. She hadn’t adjusted to getting on the Baby-sitters Club’s radar.

How did I decide if it was time for a baby-sitting club? I stopped and considered for a moment. What if a friend of Claudia’s came to each meeting and asked to interview. Would that actually happen? Would the person call the other members and say, “I’ll do it, just call you if we’re not sure?” or “Sure, let’s do it.”

That was the thinking tank I was going to call the Baby-sitters Club. Then I saw what Claudia’s uncle had to say about it. I knew he needed to hear it, but not too soon. I gave up.

The Baby-sitters Club was now in my opinion “almost” necessary, even when it wasn’t for the club itself. It was the perfect club for me because I’d joined it. Now I’d be a member someday, but for now, I’m so happy I joined it.

Anyway, I was so excited about the meeting that I went upstairs to my room and started making lemonade (did I mention pretzels?) and stuff. I decided it was time to clean up. Then I went upstairs to my bedroom and joined the mess. I almost died when Dawn came in and said that her brother Charlie was looking forward to going to a new neighborhood after school. I was going to go inside and stay out. It was time for a party. Which means no parties, no parties. Let me leave the party for you.

The sound of a car alarm sounded in my bedroom and I went out to get it. I could hear my mother and father both moaning and smacking their feet as they hurried into the room. Claudia grabbed their ankles and started running down the hall.

I had to jump up when Dawn called that Charlie was expecting a new mom and went on to tell everyone about the Baby-sitting Mistake.

Kristy, our president, is the one who held the club together. She organized it all into a single place and she kept saying over and over again, “All right, all right, all Right,” just so everyone knew what was going on. There was no room for a lot of complaining and complaining didn’t even begin to cover up what was happening around me. I was really unhappy.<|endoftext|>
Claudia Kishi passed her snacks around the room and slid into the living room, wearing her green linen jumpers. She looked like she was going to fall asleep next to Stacey McGill.

This was nothing compared to the fear and trembling in her arms and the way Claudia had said that Stacey had fallen backwards in the bed. Claudia had to feel bad for Stacey, since she’d never been so warm and winded since moving here. And what a sight Stacey had had. No lights, no TV to watch her through the night.

Even her outfit didn’t help. On one hand, there was nothing to make her look at all comfortable. Not even an anti-nausea ball. On the other hand, Claudia wasn’t supposed to wear contacts. That’s because they were kind of hard for her to get, even though it looks fine with Claud’s hair flying.

So, before we went any further, I turned to the clock. 5:27. Dawn had left the door open so we could start the meeting.

I smiled at Kristy and pushed a fresh bottle of red meat on the table. “All right, everybody,” I said, “Everyone has time now. It’s five-thirty. Any new business?”

“Anyone else find out,” Kristy said.

I set my fork down on the plate at the foot of the bed and passed out on the floor.

As I lay there, thinking about Stacey and her fall, I thought of my friends in the Baby-sitters Club. They’re just the best friends I could have ever had. And they sure are. I know that kind of person, Kristy. I also know that just about everyone at the club — except Kristy, who never talks about Kristy but always hears about me — is under twenty-one. Those are the sort of people who will stand in your way or make a mistake in the face of danger. (Which usually
