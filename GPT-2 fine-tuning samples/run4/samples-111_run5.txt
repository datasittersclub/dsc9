======== SAMPLE 1 ========
re-do/do it properly, and don't do any of that again. This is a baby-saking disease. There have been more than a million Baby-sitters since their arrival, and this one was one of them. We had a baby sitter from the start, and we called our own number. Claudia Kilbourne, a mother of two, and Jessi Ramsey, who's thirteen, helped us out with the baby-sitting duties. They're great at it, especially since we have a lot of new members trying to join us.

I had my first baby-sit job while Claudia Kilbourne was away. We had a really busy schedule. We had a huge BSC meeting in Stoneybrook on Tuesday afternoon, where we were going to decide which rooms to give our sitting jobs to. When all the information was in order I got an update on the scheduling.

I'm sure everyone could tell the truth, but I was on time and got my job. I'm pretty sure I could say all the things everyone else couldn't, but I didn't complain.

We all agreed on one thing: Claudia's job was to provide space for Baby-sitters. This meant sitting for sitting events or baby-sitting activities. The job was very simple: We could each set up a sitting spot of our own, and have as many people fill it as we wanted.

We did it all the time this past Monday, even though there wasn't any organized organizing to be had.

At first I felt a little overwhelmed. I mean, I've done it all these years, but it wasn't like this time. We were all so involved in each other's jobs that it wasn't hard to see that it was a good idea to organize our jobs.

Maybe it was. But I think Claudia Kilbourne should at least be more responsible.

After all the planning, we agreed that one thing you have to love about our jobs is that they are so organized and well thought-out that if they do become stale, we may have a baby-sitting job in a week. (You know, the one that leaves the parent with a baby. So we think of that job as a permanent one.)

And it works. We do our own jobs and have baby-sitters who help out with jobs too. I'd say we have lots to be thankful for.

What did the Baby-sitters Club tell us?

We thought the club was helpful. We thought it was the main reason that we were so successful. But we weren't convinced that the club was really about sharing baby-sitting jobs.

We also thought that if anything was going to happen, it probably wouldn't be baby-sit jobs. I'm sure Baby-sitters would love having to share baby-sitting jobs with other clients. When the club meets on Mondays and Wednesdays, the BSC members don't usually sit out baby-sitting jobs.

Anyway, there you have it. When did we learn we could do both and why? We thought so at the beginning. Then we thought we'd learn that the club would be a lot more organized if we were involved in them.

When we thought we were going to learn about our jobs, we thought we'd learn to organize them very easily. And when everybody thought at first, when we thought we'd learn what jobs did and didn't fit in neatly.

That's where we are. We're parents. We've seen it firsthand. When we talk to our kids, they tell us that you have to be involved in several important places during your baby-sitting activities: housework, phone-sitting, picking out baby-sitting supplies, and so on. But it's even better if you're a parent, too.

There's even more information to be known about our jobs.

Claudia recently told me she had been taking a job as a child-sitter for over five years. (Her name's Abby, and her age is seventeen.) Now she's back in the BSC.

The idea came first when I was younger and Karen saw that the BSC was about to be a baby-sit club (what a club!). Suddenly she and I were in fact at a crossroads. We needed to understand exactly how to make the club better. We needed to understand what kinds of kids our parents were. We needed to understand what kind of baby-sitting jobs they offered. Finally we did. The project was complete, now we could start the Baby-sitters Club.

Claudia has two older brothers and one younger sister. They're on a steady, steady, steady train to becoming parents. And Claudia and her mom are making it almost as easy for them to get started.

I'll never forget Claudia's cries of pain.

By the way,
