 friends," she says now. "For those reasons, we tried to hold meetings at Claudia's house. It would be a nightmare."

Our club treasurer, Mary Anne, is one of the members. She is an associate member, meaning we don’t have to pay dues but we do have jobs if we’re not full time. Stacey collects dues after we pay dues and we help buy supplies for events for our baby-sitting charges. We use the money for things such as Claudia’s phone bill and Sam’s art supplies. If there’s anything left over, we spend it on something fun such as a slumber party or pizza night.

Stacey is as good as it gets. She is an athlete who loves to be a part of the big picture. Her deep brown eyes look dramatic and natural, and she always knows exactly what she is doing. The energy in her blue eyes give her the look of a California snowboarder. She looks terrific — and she loves to dress in jeans and T-shirts for weeks at a time.

Here’s how our club works. We meet in Claudia’s room the day after every meeting, because she has her own phone. We don’t tie up anybody’s family phone the way we do hers. Stacey (that’s the number that runs between Kristy and me) checks the club record book to see who’s free on that day. Then, a day or so later, Stacey calls to ask if we’re available. Our conversation begins with, “How old are you — thirty-one, go figure. Thirty-one coming soon.”

Stacey and I are the oldest in our families. Maybe this proves people are as old as we let on, or that they really know what they are doing. Our parents are strict and very, very careful about what they give us. I remember being thirteen, and having a party go terribly wrong. All my friends in the sixth grade got rowdy and insisted I go to bed. I did, and a lot of the things were right. But I wish my parents would loosen up a little. I wish I could learn to be a better parent and forget my brother's dictatorial nature. Also, I wish I could be prepared to deal with any situation that comes up when I’m not at my friends’ anymore so I can work toward being better parents myself.

I wish I could think outside the box I’d just made up. I wish I could imagine what it would be like to baby-sit with a pro-biotic, pro-sugar parent. Plus, I wish I could be prepared to take on any of the other responsibilities that come along with being a pro — especially a special physical heath for my kids when they need it, and a well-balanced diet (a chocolate-and-jelly-munchies diet for me) to help keep me sharp and on top of things.

“How is school?” Mary Anne started when she spoke about us. “Great!”

“Well, I’m doing really well,” everyone said in unison.

“Really?” Mary Anne sounded a little guilty. “Well, I’m starting school right now.”

“Stacey, this is very good news. You could have a great career one day, like Robert DeNiro did — which of course he was born in!”

“It really is good news," Kristy said, glancing suspiciously at Claudia.

“I could see a bright side to President Johnson,” Ip said.

“President Johnson would be a great president!” Abby exclaimed.

“Sure,” Mary Anne spoke up. “I really like Mr. Spier.”

Kristy wasn’t happy with the announcement. “What a shame we didn’t have a sitcom by the time we settled down at the Pikes’ today.”

Kristy looked uncomfortable. “Well, Mr. Spier’s just announced that he needs a sitcom with none of the regular people at all available,” she reported as saying.

“Really?” Claudia asked.

“Yes, I guess.”

“So Mr. Spier just decided that he’d be the host of the show — which is kind of a big deal now,” Claudia reported. “Well, this is a terrific idea.”

“The Pikes don’t play softball until they play softball,” Stacey declared.

“They hold some of the hardest-
