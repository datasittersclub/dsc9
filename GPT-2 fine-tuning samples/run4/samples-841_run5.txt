, and so on. Even the fashion industry is like Mary Anne's company.

If you ask me, Mary Anne's company (our small, friendly, easy-going) could be called Mary Anne's baby-sitter. She's always available, since she's the only one of us who has her own phone. She never has to dress, to buy makeup, or to do anything else with the money she's made, which is important. And she's always getting the job she really deserves.

Mary Anne's family life is pretty complicated, so she'll leave it at that. She did start out as a divorced mother — divorced, really — until her dad got a job at the New York City office of a major advertising agency. The ad agency wanted Mary Anne to work for him for part of the summer, and she thought he'd work much longer. When he got married (and now he's returned to Stoneybrook, where she's spent the past year living for herself) Mary Anne soon found that dating could be a problem. He just didn't want her back in high school, so he took her back to high school. (He couldn't return her old high school years, in fact, they were over when he was there — on the hill, in the woods.) By the time she was in seventh grade, the rest of us were taking her back to Stoneybrook.

Then something interesting happened. For a long time, school was her only true freedom. For example, she could no longer wear makeup or draw or make friends. She began to crave Mary Anne's friendship, and she was eager to prove to her best friend that she could do the same for her own friends. I know everyone feels bad about this, but Mary Anne has lived in Stoneybrook since the beginning, and we all hope she'll be able to live a normal, happy and successful life while in Stoneybrook.

Mary Anne is the BSC's treasurer. She's a real math whiz, who loves to collect and save up for new projects. She's in charge of keeping track of all the money BSC dues have. That's more than enough for clothes, clothes, and house.

Another thing that makes Mary Anne a great treasurer is that she is totally scatterbrained. She can't write down all the jobs on the calendar, because we have separate days, and she has to sort through the money in our treasury every once in awhile. When we split the money, she'd have to be super-strawberry-flavored-and-sweetened for life, so to speak. (We're all pretty sure she tastes just like that.)

Another nice thing about Mary Anne is that she has a sister, Anna. Her name is Anna Watson, and her brother is a war veteran.

Now that Mary Anne is a regular member of the BSC, we have another new member, Dawn Schafer. Since the club was formed (which was way before she was a member) she came to all of us as our second daughter. How did she get so attached to us? Well, Dawn's mom grew up in California, so now she and Mary Anne and her dad live in the neighborhood of the old house where Dawn and Anna used to live. (Now the McGills have moved into the addition. We miss Dawn as much as we love to hate! But it's the changes in family that take me up that I really keep track of her well.)

Dawn is also tall and thin. She has thick, reddish-brown hair, and pale skin. She's a natural athlete. Dawn always manages to be on top of her game. I've heard she's good in sports — running, football, soccer, volleyball. But she can't be bothered with football stuff because she's good in it. That day she was in the sixth grade when Abby Stevenson left town for an all-Russian team called Chechen Spirit. When Dawn left to take some time away from her job, she took Abby back. They had been in a lot of sports together, and both girls feel that Abby is an outstanding athlete.

Dawn used to be our alternate officer, in case someone had to miss a meeting. But she's been in this job twice now, once for a special project and once because she missed Abby when she moved to Stoneybrook from California.

In January Dawn's mom, Sharon (whom Sharon and I miss very much), got married. It was a pretty big ceremony, especially considering that Dawn's mother and Sharon's father had already been high school brats. (See, they were best friends at Stoneybrook.) Anyway, we were all gathered in the living room of the We ♥ Kids Club headquarters, waiting for Dawn and our other newest member, Mary Anne, to get to know each other. Dawn and Mary Anne's mother are high school sweethearts, and Mary Anne's mother is an
