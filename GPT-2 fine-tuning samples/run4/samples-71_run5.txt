======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 of a person with autism, the person's skin will become brittle, as if they had a broken jaw. Then there will be skin, or at least hair.

When your hair grows out, it usually gets a little yellowish-brownish-greyish, so the other end of the needle points to your skin. Sometimes the needle will even be gone by accident, because that might mean you lost some of the hair. Sometimes that's just a coincidence with your clothes — like when you are wearing a tie, or something like that, because you are wearing a tie that you could be wearing over something, even though it's not the right tie.

Clothes are your best friend. Some of your favorite things — like your favorite books, the jewelry you keep in your bag or the stuff you make out of it — are pretty darn cute and pretty cool. I know that sounds strange — it's like going out for dinner. You are the last member of your family, so you usually dress in pretty good clothes when you're hungry. You are gorgeous and sophisticated — even though you're only seven and wearing your hair straight (which is kind of disgusting).

All in all, I feel fine. You have something to prove. Maybe this makes you feel better.

I mean, this is what the BSC and I are all about — showing our members that we have something to prove. That's how they want to make us feel. The BSC has taken over our jobs — a club of six members a week — for four years now.

We talk the usual charges — paying dues, having our own phone number, and a club phone line. Our associate teachers call us when we aren't meeting in a club meeting. Usually they call us to tell us we need help. In a BSC case, if we're stuck on a client, that's not enough. We need to be successful clients in order for us to be part of a successful club.

"I need a job with the BSC." That's how the first line of my name became synonymous with mine and my entire BSC of the United States — to tell our members that we need a job. That means being helpful — telling you what your clients are saying, keeping our record files, keeping up with our meetings, and so on.

There are four BSC officers in our club. The officers are responsible for our meetings. In these four jobs, we use three callers for each of our four members.

The job title is usually assigned to one of these officers:

Chief: The one who comes in and calls in our meetings. Can you give us a description for a person who is on top of her game in this position?

A-Ha!

A-Ha!

"Hello, Aisha, you have a problem?" Karen said toward the back of us. She was standing on one of our steps in case someone else would come in and help us sort out the phone.

"Uh, hi," we said, turning to our associate, Stacey.

She was in the process of making the phone call.

"Hello, Stacey. The call was picked up by her brother," we said. "He's here."

"Are you going to tell him? He was called to check up on his father yesterday. And he's got a problem."

"My brother had a big accident, so he has a severe asthma condition," Karen interrupted. "I'm taking him to the emergency room right now. I want him out in the afternoon, anyway. I have to go on job, you know? I hope he can."

Karen smiled. "Thanks for that, Mr. Spier. I'll tell him if he's going to go to the hospital tomorrow."

Our associate shook her head. "We don't ever call that unless he can be found. If our client can't be found, he can't be reached."

"You might want to call him later, because this is a sensitive situation."

Stacey shook her head again. "It was very complicated, Mr. Spier. We didn't know whether he'd arrive by tomorrow afternoon. We never called because he wasn't available. So, Mr. Spier, if he's at the hospital, he's at this meeting."

"Okay, Mr. Spier, we've received an ad for your business. Do you think this one will go on sale?"

Stacey was about to tell the rest of us about it when something clicked on my phone. I knew what I was about to say…. There was an ad in our newsletter the other day, and a week before that, at a club meet. A guy named Don Bock was holding a contest. He was asking who could come in and fill out an ad for Stacey for a job. No one was sure.
