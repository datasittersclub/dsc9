. We are thrilled to be back in the business again. The only thing left is for me and Watson to take vacations and buy their own clothing. (We don’t have any of that anymore, though.) But before we go that far, I suggest that you read a lot of the other mysteries I’ve been reading. That means you’ll know a lot more about each one, just like you’d know about the mysteries in Watson’s. He’s one of the best mysteries guys I know.

Okay, to begin with, there’s Kristy’s. (Kristy’s the president of the BSC. She’s funny and energetic. She doesn’t like to get in fights with anybody, except her former best friend Mary Anne.) Kristy is the president of the club because she’s president and founder. That, of course, means she has to follow the president’s orders and follow all these rules and regulations. That was certainly my idea. She was thinking of putting Kristy, Mary Anne, and Abby on an equal footing with Claudia. She should also have to pay dues and earn money for her BSC activities. I don’t know enough about the club to know all the specifics. (But I have enough info to know how the club works and how it works.) For one thing, she doesn’t always know how to operate the club. For another thing, she doesn’t have a steady family like Abby and Mary Anne do. That was partly because she has diabetes and part because her father didn’t do a lot of sitting. (He died suddenly when he was very sick.) You see, Abby and Mary Anne have a lot of health problems — which is good because sometimes they just don’t feel right about it.

Abby and Mary Anne have had to deal with it all their lives, but they are lucky to be so different. I think they are alike in a lot of ways. When I was a baby, I saw something I would never have seen in my own father-daughter relationship. Sometimes my parents weren’t nice to me but once their words calmed down, I found out that Mary and Abby were alike in a lot of ways and that they did not share most of the same interests. Then a long road led Abby and Mary Anne across California to California with their mother, to an apartment, to the dentist, and to the BSC. They ended up falling in love and got married. Then, they had a baby, Karen, who is now eleven. Well, that was a long, long time ago. But now they are in their twenties.

That’s the reason they were chosen members of our club. But to me, the timing could not have been better. You know how kids are fun and exciting. And you know there are plenty of them around. So you should be pretty excited to be getting married and seeing your family again. There’s really no telling what will happen with Abby and Mary Anne in the future.

But the fact that Kristy lives in a mansion makes it interesting to read. I guess you could call it the best thing the city has to offer. Not that there aren’t other rich neighborhoods in Massachusetts, but there could be other people rich in some way. I guess the only other things Kristy likes more than New York City are her art. She doesn’t have the same art style and she doesn’t care much about clothes. She has one great talent after another. And she has lived in such a style that you can tell that she’s very sophisticated and very sophisticated.

Now, I’m not sure how Kristy could spend all her time and energy on clothes and paint and art. But one thing that she does care about is her taste in music. She’s a great artist. She’s talented in a lot of ways. But I think she really can draw her own clothes, which is what we had in mind. Kristy has long, dark, dark hair, which she has long, short silky brown eyes with dark almond-shaped eyes. (Her parents don’t approve of her curly hair, but Kristy’s hair is as curvy as her parents.) She wears jeans, sneakers, and a sport coat.

Kristy loves sports. (I think she’s the oldest of them.) She was an athlete all her life, although she never was involved in anything serious until she married Watson’s wife, Mary Anne Spier. As I mentioned before, she has diabetes, which means she has to give herself insulin every day or else the pancreas can't handle a sugar-fixing drug like insulin.

One thing she does get involved in is driving in and out of her neighborhoods very often. She
