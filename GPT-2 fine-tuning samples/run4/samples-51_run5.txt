A few more weeks ago, the Kishi-Kishi family took on another family for a week, and the kids seemed to be well. Now we all live with family members in the same house.

What is the most important thing you did to make your kids grow up, Mrs. Kishi-Kishi?

Life was great so far. Kids were very strong, and I was very happy.

I guess Mrs. Kishi-Kishi thought it would be fun and fun for her kids to be the happiest they could be. They were. And the world was great, too.

I can tell the true picture of Mrs. Kishi-Kishi's life. She used to live in an amazing mansion on Buhlin, and was one of the greatest and most important people I ever met. I could tell she was not a shy person, or one of those kids who would come to bed early (sometimes late), but had a great sense of humor and was totally different from the other kids.

I remember the most intense meeting I ever had in my life. We were sitting in our room — on the bed, watching the television, discussing art, fashion, junk food, and other things that kids were reading at school, and discussing art and literature together. A big part of that was I had never met anyone with a real sense of humor and the passion of an artist like Mr. Kishi. I have to admit, not everyone would approve of that, though. Kids are too often mean and immature to live up to their reputation as entertainers.

You're a hard-boiled wrecking ball. You can get caught off guard. Maybe that's why you take so long to get a real job — I can't stand that kind of drama. But you can be good and creative — especially when the job involves getting a job done.

So you're not a wrecking ball? Can you ever turn a bad job into something better? (Well, sure, when I was younger I would always say "no.")

You've got to admit, if you were a wrecking ball, then you'd be pretty tough on the kids involved. If you are, your parents wouldn't let you go. You'd only be in the presence of a terrible person, and everybody wouldn't be able to calm down. Then it would be too late for kids like you, Mr. and Mrs. Kishi.

The day Mrs. Kishi-Kishi and I spoke to Mrs. Spier, our jobs became ever more complex and I couldn't tell the difference. Mr. Spier said that we were a club and we needed help with the club's budget. Mrs. Spier and I agreed that we needed help with our schedules. That's right. I told Mrs. Spier we'd bring along our kids, if we could use them with any kind of schedule. We agreed.

I'll admit that I thought at first that the Kishi-Kishi family was the best in the whole world. I was wrong. They are the best. They are also the one most responsible, because everybody keeps coming to you for help.

Mr. Spier always calls us back to order and to answer any phone calls we might have had. It would make you wonder about the day's work.

My wife and I (who are both parents to our two two-year-old brother, Logan), are all extremely loyal. We know we need a few more kids, and we're sure we'll never get them in our family. But we really like Logan better than the rest of us. And he loves us as much as anyone else. Logan is also a nice kid. He's always available for a walk or jog, and he comes in plenty to do the homework.

Besides our jobs, Stacey and I have lots of other jobs — such as babysitting, baby-sitting, coloring, and so on. We both have jobs in our own apartment.

Our families, on the other hand, live in our bedroom, which is the only place Mrs. Spier manages their families in. She has an extra bedroom for Logan, and it looks a lot like her bedroom in our private mansion. We also don't live much alike. Our parents live in separate houses, so they can't live together quite like their children in some countries.

But we are family. It's true. It can't be anything like that anymore.

And we are very, very happy. And we're very, very, happy. And we're super, super competitive. One of our best friends is a Japanese national. She's also a math and language major. Plus he hates baseball and Japanese and English, so she and I have great health problems.

Our neighborhood has lots of Japanese neighbors, too. And it's very very Japanese. As in, we're very popular
