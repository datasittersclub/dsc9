======== SAMPLE 1 ========
's only on me, my own boyfriend, that you take a lot of phone calls and you're not able to concentrate, so here's one phone call I need to make for Mr. Schafer, which is in the afternoon, 5:37am on the Monday after Monday nights, when I make that phone call. That's how I remember it. It was a Saturday afternoon that Mr. Schafer called me. I was a little surprised — I knew it was all the work he needed to finish the job to get that phone call — but then I thought, "Wait, Mr. Schafer had to call me again to record the phone service. That, too, is not possible. For example, the phone company has to call me to take care of this job, or else the company won't know where the call is coming from. A phone guy like that needs to find out where, and then phone numbers and other information are hidden for everyone who dials and calls him; that would be even more difficult."

This is not the only situation in which Mr. Schafer is responsible. He works the night shift, which, in turn, means he has to work two jobs for every other one. For example, on Monday evenings — Mr. Schafer is a boss, so does all of her other clients — Mr. Schafer, his wife, and his brothers and sisters come to meetings to talk about problems like Mr. Schafer's, or Mr. Schafer's family (which is one of the greatest, most successful families in all of America), and have to sit at all the meetings while Mr. Schafer and his family — including his mom, and her brothers and sisters, as well as the two babies — are being born (or are already born, according to the family plan). I hope Mr. Schafer and her family makes a big impact on our city, since we don't have much to do here.

Another thing I noticed about Mr. Schafer was how much he has grown and grown and grown with the years and years that have passed along. He's had three children since high school, and one of them's two boys is now a teenager of five. You might not recognize him either way, but you know what he's been telling you? He's been living in the past, and he's been living in the future. We're all happy to pass along some kind of old-fashioned old-fashioned old-fashioned old-fashioned time for Mr. Schafer, just as we were at his old club.

One other thing that I noticed is Mr. Schafer's always looking forward to meeting new people. He wants to be able to sit at our table if it doesn't always come that way, like it could happen for him in his home town. What does that mean? Well, it means meeting new people in the same room, at the same time.

I've said it a million times before, like it can't be happening again.

In the afternoon of Saturday, Mary Anne was on her way to her meeting.

"Mary Anne, are you going to sit at the table?" asked Mary Anne. "It is going to be Monday."

"I think we should be able to talk about it," said Mr. Schafer.

"Well, I know it won't," Mary Anne said as she walked into the room. "I can see you're in trouble."

He smiled a little. "I suppose you're not," he said. "It's not the time for the discussion, but I can hear you're worried about the job you are going to be assigned. Is that right?"

He asked Mary Anne, but then Mary Anne turned around and waved.

"I'll tell you the facts, Mary Anne," said Mr. Schafer. "You're on the job. I'll do all the information I can for you, if it's necessary. But I need you. I need you to sit, Mary Anne. Don't worry about your phone lines, Mary Anne. I'll call up it in a few minutes."

"Don't worry." Mary Anne said.

"I'll tell you exactly. If you're really worried, Mary Anne. Remember, I'm going to talk to you," said Mr. Schafer of the job.

Mary Anne looked like a nervous wreck. "I guess I'll just call you back at noon," she said.

I guess I'll just call back at noon.

She hung her head in her hands, her eyes sparkling with hope. And then she reached up and pulled a notebook from under her bed.

Mary Anne, reading her notes, was just thinking of all the things she'd discovered, all the things she could learn about herself.

"You know," she finished, "what kind of a job it would be. You would need to have a meeting in
