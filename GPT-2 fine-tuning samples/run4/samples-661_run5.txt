th, and she was about to have a very difficult time with it. Claudia and I were the youngest kids at the time, and we were in eighth grade at the time the We ♥ Kids Club was formed. My brothers and I are ten and a half today. To begin with, it was a really rough time for the Beezers before our parents found out! Claudia’s dad died when she was little, and my mother (who is a best friend of Kristy’s) was frantically trying to find a baby-sitter for Kristy’s younger brother, Jeff. By then the We ♥ Kids Club was in high gear, and Claudia (as the newest member) had an ace up her sleeve. That was the beginning of Kristy’s cool relationship with her parents.

She and her mom were still married shortly after Kristy and Mary Anne left, and although I don’t think they realized how awful it would be, they knew they needed a central place for their new friendships to stay alive. And it was a perfect place.

Kristy had decided early on that she wanted to live with her parents (her mom had recently died, and she and Kristy had been friends since before she had met Mary Anne) and with a good family to support herself. This made sense, as they had a lot in common. But it also wasn’t what Mrs. Thomas had been looking forward to having to face. There was hardly anyone else around, especially not Claudia’s dad.

I’ve already told you about the other members of the club, and I’ve told you about the dues they make. Stacey McGill (Mary Anne’s mother) and Claudia Kishi (the sixth-grader) are the junior officers. There is a big class — junior officer, that is. That is, if any other club members have any more business. That group has almost four times as many members as there are sitters in the entire sixth grade (boys, girls, and all). Stacey and Claudia are very close. They have even become good friends. They are the BSC treasurer, and they also pay our expenses. As they age, those expenses become more and more important. Like Kristy, Claudia is an athlete for some reason. She runs the Kishi kids through class.

If you thought the Kishi family looked like babies, you haven’t even told Kristy about them. The Kishis have seven-year-old daughter-children. In fact, I’ve already mentioned the fact that they had seven members back in grade one, so you’d know the entire family already. They were only allowed to sit during the day if it meant eating out, brushing their teeth, and keeping the Kishis entertained. But the BSC has expanded even more recently. Last year they even made a big, special commitment to the BSC notebook. Each of us records our sitting experiences, which are often incredibly helpful. Then we read the notebook to each other every day, so when we’re home from school, we’re ready to read anything. And if all that “sleeping experience” isn’t enough, Kristy is president.

The Kishis are part of the BSC because the club was her idea. She thought of it one day when her mother was frantically trying to track down a sitter for a sitting family. Then she and Mary Anne discovered how important it was to find a sitter for every job in the school calendar. That idea caught on and the club got started again. Today Stacey and Claud made a brilliant discovery: the Kishis had put an ad up in the newspaper. The kids liked it and liked finding jobs, and so did the family. The ad grossed about seven hundred people. (Only them and their money getting caught.)

At that time, my father was on a roll. There were seven members in the BSC, all regular members. That makes me one of the founding members. I’m so used to keeping jobs a mystery that I’d have to admit that I’d have to say that all of the irregular members were pretty neat, too.

My mother, who’s not a member of the BSC, goes to a different school. Her name is Dawn Schafer, but you know what she is? A pretty intense individual. She’s a tomboy, and she never shies away from answering people’s questions. But, like Stacey, she does what she thinks is right (for example, the right thing at the right time).

I’m glad my mother isn’t a sports fan. She just doesn’t care much about sports. The most basic requirement for being an athlete is good posture and good vision. In my case that means a
