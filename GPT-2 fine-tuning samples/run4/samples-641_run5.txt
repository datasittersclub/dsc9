 and he had plenty of work. But, I should know, because I helped him build a business.<|endoftext|>
The front door to my bedroom opened just as I arrived at 555 Connecticut St., the closest of our two local, alternative, baby-sitting clubs. Jessi and her two kids (they are both six) were front and center, followed by Mallory and her older brother, who was on the floor, watching me rush across. "Hmmm, I never expected to find such a busy dance class," I grumbled as I slammed the door.

Jessi, who is African-American, is the oldest of eight kids, including her three older brothers, Charlie and Sam. She's also very responsible, as she will give anyone a little treat (usually food!) without fail. The kids on her street are also the most amazing — they can dance, write poetry, and plan a wild vacation without worrying who will be there. Jessi's brother Charlie is a very good ballet student. As I slipped into the room and shut the door, a voice asked, "Why are we here, anyway?" and the room fell silent. I was alone with Laine. I was the only one in the room with Laine. I had to turn around to see her — and her face turned bright red. "What are you doing?" she asked as she bounded past us. Laine sits in my English class one day. She's an associate member of the BSC. The club meets in her room and monitors our club calls and events. When a client calls, we take down the information about the working day and then call back for someone to take over all the jobs. Laine is my steady boyfriend, although she's not used to being with lots of people.

"I wonder what you're doing," Laine was saying, before I heard her say, "but I don't know anything. Either you have to make some kind of announcement or I'll call someone and shut the door."

"What's you talking to me for?" I asked her. Laine shook her head in confusion. "Are you going to call Claudia, Stacey, or something?" she asked, glancing at my clock. "I haven't been able to contact them yet. Nothing this week."

"What about next week?" I asked.

Laine shook her head. "I haven't decided yet," she said firmly. "I'm going to take some baby-sitting classes this week." We all stood up and started our jobs. Laine has taken some of my classes and my other classes. At least, she's been on the job since I called her. I could tell she was feeling better.

Laine is not a baby-sitter. She has a lifelong problem. The problem is not just her academic abilities. It's allergies. Her asthma is a huge part of her body, especially in the winter. She has to keep her inhalers on, since she's allergic to a lot of things, especially dust. Plus, she has to be very careful about what she puts in those things. Her best friend on the BSC is Mal, and when we were in her room, her best friend was Stacey McGill. (She's also my best friend and the BSC's treasurer.) Stacey's a real math whiz, and she has a great IQ.

As soon as I mentioned the similarities between Laine and Mal, Stacey said, "And I'm not just talking about the similarities; I have similarities as well. I'm the only BSC member who has a steady boyfriend. His name is Logan Bruno."

"He's good," Stacey said. "He's the only one who can call Logan Bruno. Not that he's as good as you think."

"You guys are kidding!" Jessi said. "Logan's not just any guy. He's a legend."

"He's my boyfriend," Mal said. "You'd think I'd be more secure with him around."

"It would make me feel special! I couldn't have the same feelings about Logan as I did last week!" Mal is our newest member, and she's been helping to organize the club for the past couple of weeks. (Logan is the treasurer of the BSC — she makes sure to keep track of the money we earn at the meeting and we all pay dues every Monday — to help pay for the club itself.)

The club meets three times a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from five-thirty until six, and seven o’clock. Our clients know that we meet at their houses, and they call when they need an extra sitter. With the help of our record book, they're able to reach a lot of good sitters. With a few exceptions, none of us has trouble finding one in one day.
