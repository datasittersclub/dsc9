 She said she didn't think there'd be anything funny and gross, since she hated to leave her dog, Krusi, alone in her room with her mom and dad.

"What do you think?"

She looked so surprised after that.

"Maybe I should sit out one more night with you," I said firmly.

"Yes, Mr. Krusi," said Shannon, as I went over to the stove and took a deep breath. Shannon's voice was booming, and her hair was all red.

I stood up straight, and Shannon was grinning.

"I think it could be fun to watch the kids and the music together," she said.

"I mean, it could be fun," I said, but I couldn't help but think that I was making a joke.

"Can you have some tea and a little leek in your pot?" asked Shannon. That was a serious compliment. She brought a big wooden spoon with it. She sat back down on Shannon's bed.

"Here's a good treat," said Shannon. "We both have a very strong appetite for things in the evenings (hindutans and pizza and fruit and sweets and all those things), so there's an evening nap in the pool, and there's a little pizza, too. And we have a great time, so it shouldn't be too difficult."

As we drank, there were loud noises, lots of laughter. And then, a really big burst of soft laughter. The sound was so loud that Shannon could barely hear the giggles. When her laughter died down, Shannon gave me a big pat on the back for looking forward to the night.

Kristy, who'd returned to the company after leaving the club, stood next to me. She could barely speak. But she knew it was a great time and we were excited to have a good time together. And she just as easily said she wanted to go back. Because Kristy is very cool.

By the time Shannon's husband and her friends had left, Shannon and Bumble had grown up in a big, small house across town from Shannon's. It didn't take long for them to find jobs. After Shannon's mom remarried, she and Bumble moved into Bumble's mother's old Stoneybrook mansion. And the baby was born.

Since Bumble had a large family, Bumble had to raise four kids and have all of his siblings together. (You wouldn't believe how many people I'd been with.) And Bumble, too, has had his own life changes, too. And Shannon, who's a member of the Boy Scouts of America, has been through a lot. And her younger sister, Janine, who's a junior in high school, is in high school and has to keep up appearances to be included in Girl Scouts.'s, too.

Now, Shannon and Bumble share the same house, with plenty of room for Shannon's family and a lot of room for her children: four steps, to go. (No wonder Bumble and Shannon are best friends.)

But there's something different about the Bumble's. In Bumble's case, it wasn't that she's a BSC member, but that she's an associate member — since Bumble's sister is from Florida. It was that Bumble and her mom, Dawn, had been friends. And while their relationship might seem awkward, it's not that difficult for a BSC member to be in a BSC meeting. (Claudia’s is a special-education town and Bumble and her brother Josh were both in high school, which is a little quieter compared to the rest of the BSCs out there.)

That isn’t always the case, though. After all, when Shannon joined, she and Bumble lived in a lot of different small houses. Before Shannon moved into Kristy’s mansion (which she and Dawn live on) they lived in a mansion called the Spitz, which is much bigger than their two-story home and has a big, beautiful pool.

It really is an enormous mansion. And even though the Spitz has a lot of pets, no one has to hide their pets from the Spitz. (Not the Spitz. Because it is a secret room with lots of pets, but the Spitz is not.)

As an associate member, Bumble is very cool — but she's also very slow. She keeps a diary, which has to be filled in with her school-age information, which would be very difficult for Bumble to read, since the BSC is a club. But once you have it, it can be a little difficult to resist being in a club, especially after you have joined your father’s club.

The club is important for Dawn Michelle, Stacey McGill, and her two younger brothers,
