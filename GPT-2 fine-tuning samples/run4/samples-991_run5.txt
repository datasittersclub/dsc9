 and the other one was Abby Stevenson, a great New Yorker.”

“We’re all here?” Jessi asked.

“I think so.” (I was dying to tell the story in its own right.)

“I love that place,” Claudia told me firmly.

“It’s really amazing.” Kristy went on.

“Five stars.”

Jessi finished reading the book Club business. I knew her eyes lit up. She was dying to talk about anything Disney or Chez Maurice or Anything But Louie, but five stars would be the closest I could get. I couldn’t wait to hear her raving about it.

“Five stars for Jessi!” Claudia shouted.

Jessi slid into the room and sat on the bed next to me. We talked about what everyone had done and nothing else at all. By the time our meeting was over, Mary Anne had moved the Barretts back to New York. (The Velvets had been an extension family for years.) Now Mary Anne lives in the Big Apple, with her mom.

Kristy pulled the record book open and pulled out a manila envelope.

“Order!” she announced as she grabbed the receiver.

Mary Anne ripped open the envelope, threw it onto the bed, and slammed it against the door.

The music played in my mind as I closed my eyes and thought about Louie and Jessi and Abby and Mallory and Shea and Jamie and Shannon and Shannon. I glanced at the clock on Claudia’s desk and sighed. There were seven of us, and a girl was sleeping ♥seven!<|endoftext|>
I slept soundly at Claudia Kishi’s afternoons for the next couple of months. Then on Wednesday night I woke up in a great Big Apple for the first time in my life. It was really dark. Lately Wednesday Night Special had eased into my room just a little more, but I was still dreading Monday when the doors to Claudia’s was right up through the Christmas special. Any time you replace a pillow with a crème de la croissant you feel less like a mismatched dresser and more like home.

Kristy Thomas is the president of the Baby-sitters Club. She started it when she joined the club in the first place. She invented it, I guess, because one night I was wearing a teddy bear blanket to a bed of drawers, and the other night she’d brought her big brown box with her. The blanket blanket was a joke, a joke on how bad a bear she was going to wear it over her tights and at every turn, a joke on how much fun she had having a big family. Kristy knew she’d have to expand on the club, but she hadn’t had the time or money for two sitters. So she got Bart Taylor, who’s performed the piano parts of some of our plays, and told him I’d introduce the special club members. We had a good laugh and he asked to join. The members of the club are Kristy’s idea, my family. Sometimes I think they’re pretty conservative, but Kristy keeps it down.

After we met, we didn’t have a lot of regular clients, so Kristy kept getting one call at most three. Now we have four, and that’s because Claudia has decided to move back to New York City and be an only child with her father (who had already returned to Stoneybrook).

Kristy has had to learn a lot of life lessons in her life there. For example, she can be a good leader, a tactful tactician who doesn’t get sucked into fights that other adults are having. Also, she’s shy, very self-assured, and very private.

I think Kristy has one of the loosest personalities. She’s just a talker, a really serious person who dresses really casually. She also has diabetes, which means her body can’t process sugar. That means she has to be very careful about what she eats, and she needs to give herself insulin injections every day. (I don’t really understand that, because I love math, but sometimes you know.)

Kristy also has a boyfriend, Logan Bruno. I don’t know too much about him, but I know that’s why the club is such a good thing. He’s a terrific sitter.

I’ve already told you about Logan, but I’ll make you know what he is. He’s handsome. He’s blonde and very thin, and he
