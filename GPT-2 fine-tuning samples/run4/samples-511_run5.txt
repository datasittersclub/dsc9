 the phone, we started making calls. Jessi answered some calls, and we discussed what “everybody had to get do this week.” Then Dawn and I mentioned that we were going to meet up at Claudia’s house. Kristy called Abby back and told everyone to call Shannon to tell her she’d be free.

After that, it was just Abby and me and Claudia and everyone else. I hung up the phone and turned to Mary Anne. “All right, Mrs. Kishi needs someone for me and Shannon Kilbourne, the kids, tomorrow, before we all get home from the meeting, for a while. I’ll call all of you and start calling around for someone.”

I grabbed Shannon’s arm and began talking.

“Shannon,” I said, “you’re the only one free.”

Shannon’s face turned bright red. She grabbed my hand and heaved it down hard. “You okay? It’s almost five-of-thirty.”

There was no answer.

I sighed. “Sorry, Shannon.” I decided to tell my new friend about the meeting. With no one there to take care of the phone, I had to ask her the question I’d asked her.

“I understand that all right,” said Shannon. “But I don’t know if I’m free to go on with the meeting.”

“Well, okay. We will,” I said. “And Shannon,” I went on to tell her as I hung up the phone. “Sorry,” I finished. “I’m sure we’ll be free.”

Claudia sat there with a grimace, the look of horror on her face. “We all just sort of went out there,” she said thoughtfully.

“No,” I said. “We were gone.” I gave Shannon the phone number of the meeting (called “Baby-sitters Club”) and told her I’d call her back, and that I would get in touch if any of the children I was going to hold were available. We agreed to meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon from five-thirty to six.

“I know,” said Claudia to her. “Sure. Our baby-sitter club meets every Monday and runs through at least one of the Monday after school jobs. We’re very proud of that.” She sat on Claudia’s bed and leaned forward, looking at her usual position. A sign that the club was officially adopted read, in part: “Fully integrated. The Baby-sitters Club is Jill Kishi’s idea.” The sign said, in bold type:

Fully integrated. Who needs organized organization when it comes to baby-sitting?

Claudia's first name was written so as not to confuse anyone who has ever seen her enter a meeting and not know her new baby-sitter. She’s the BSC’s treasurer (in short, she’s responsible for collecting dues from everyone except us regular clients). Our president is Mary Anne Spier, the beloved New Yorker we all love. She’s originally from California and is the country’s other best friend. When the BSC first began, she was the only member with her own phone, and she still is.

Claudia, who has brown hair and eyes, lives all over Manhattan. Her room has all the charm of a boutique, with vintage curtains hanging pouches of red-and-pink-dyed bedding. She’s sophisticated. She wears big New Look jewelry (the Lipgloss skirt, for example, is her own creation) and dresses in casual clothes. Claud speaks over and over in her room as if she were a foreign language. Sometimes she mashes her thoughts with that word “synthely” in her head.

Mary Anne, Claudia’s best friend, is the treasurer of the BSC, which is why she came to the club. Before the BSC began, Mary Anne lived near Kristy and Sharon. The two of them lived side by side. As I mentioned earlier, they were neighbors for a long time. It happened that Claud was next-door neighbor to Dawn, who was Dawn’s younger brother. Then Mary Anne met Dawn’s father. Mary Anne and Dawn both wanted their parents to adopt Dawn and their little brother, Jeff, after they moved to Watson's. They gave Dawn a whole new set of parents when they adopted Dawn and Jeff
