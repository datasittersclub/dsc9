�s the kind of person who listens to her own brain!”

“And,” said Kristy seriously, “did I mention that Abby Stevenson was in the club?”

Kristy nodded. “Okay,” she said as she went on her trail of words. “Well, maybe in a couple of short months we can have some new clients. I’ll find out whether we have a couple of good ones, and then we can begin the process of hiring them.”

A minute later a man showed up. He was dressed in a baseball cap and tie shirt that was matched to the baseball cap with the collie on it. He had a big mouth and a beard, and looked very ordinary.

“Well, look whom I’ll pick for the Kid-Kits,” Kristy told him.

“You have the same kind of job as me and the same kind of experience. Kristy, I’ll be around.”

“Great,” he said. “I’ll be your temporary baby-sitter. You have to be up-to-date on the Baby-sitters Club, as well.”

I said hello to him again and he said, “Hi, Jessi, I’m looking for some new volunteers.”

“The club is always changing,” I said to Jessi.

“It’s more than just my job,” said Kristy.

My next words came very quickly. “What about you guys,” I asked.

“Clients?” he said. “What about you and your brother?”

“I think Dad and I have a new client,” I said.

“And he’s from Long Island, so I’d say you’ll call him,” said Kristy.

Dawn, our other kitten, had arrived with two older brothers, and we began our search. As I mentioned, a few months ago we had gotten a couple of baby-sitting jobs from a couple of families across the country. We had gotten the job of bringing our kitten, Mallory. We called them after them and asked for their help.

It turned out that two of the families had just moved to town because the parents in California had become friends with the Stevensons. The Stevensons had been members of the BSC from the very beginning. At first, they wanted Emily Michelle, who was the baby of the Stevensons. They also wanted to bring along a few extra kids because Logan is an only child.

We were thrilled to turn down their offer.

Now they knew exactly what they wanted to do and we wanted those kids. We told them what had happened between the parents — Dawn and Mallory gone to California, and Logan and Mrs. Thomas got married then.

“You know,” said another call before the members of the BSC got any more information. “We’ve decided to adopt a little toddler for Logan.”

“Baby-sitting,” said Dawn.

“Yes,” replied Mallory. “We’re going to adopt Emily Michelle, and we’re getting to know her better, too.”

“Okay,” said Kristy. “Well, I guess we’ll make an announcement about Emily just then.”

“That’s okay,” said Claudia. “I’ll call you right back. I don’t have time.”

Claudia and I were in the booth, and one of the monitors on the other side of the booth took a look at the baby we were trying to bring to life. The baby looked just fine, and the monitors said so.

The next phone call came.

The phone rang then.

We called the sitting members of the BSC, who answered the phone. We talked to Claudia and Mary Anne. Then Kristy called Mrs. Stevenson right after every meeting started. Mrs. Stevenson wanted to talk to Emily Michelle, and we wanted to make an announcement about having Emily become a toddler. But none of the club members could come and do that, so we ended up going to Claudia and Stacey.

After discussing it for a very long time, the phone rang again, and the phone rang again until Dawn had just answered the phone. We started to talk, and the phone started blowing by now.

Stacey, who had just answered the phone that day, was talking about Emily Michelle with her best friend Jamie and us. Stacey didn’t
