======== SAMPLE 1 ========
The Mallomars are part of a family that includes a Bernese mountain dog puppy, an average-sized dog named Shannon, and a couple of goldfish. All goldfish. (They belong to the local branch of the Stoneybrook News. They’re also best friends.)

The club secretary is Mary Anne’s other best friend, which is why it is such a good job to baby-sit for them.

“What was that for, Dawn?” I asked, standing up from the record book.

“It was for … my mom. Her daughter received the goldfish from her father,” she explained. “She even gave it to me. I love her.”

“Wait a minute.” A look on Kristy’s face suggested that I was in for a surprise.<|endoftext|>
By the time the meeting started, the phone had rung above and over.

"Hmmm…. Well, you must be dying to know, um, you know what we’re doing on Valentine's Day?" Abby asked.

"Yes," I replied. "Last week we went to the movies. The reason for it was an art show…. And it was a production by Laine Records. I saw a little advertisement for theirs at the sales and I thought it was worth a try."

"Can I have it?" Kristy was starting to laugh now.

I snapped. "Sure. See you soon."

That Friday the Baby-sitters Club returns for a second week in the middle of the month, I dropped the subject. "Um, here we go again," I announced.

"Good-bye," everybody said. I headed for the mailbox.

As if they expected me to come back Saturday, I rushed out the door, flopped on the grass, and ran to the movie. (Laine records all their shows in the back of the copy machine.) It took more than a little wind-out for me to tire myself up enough to try again. But not too much. I was still thinking about the Valentine party.

The wind-out was almost over. I sighed and sat on my dad’s bed (his closet in the kitchen is his office) waiting for the mail.

Monday is usually Valentine Day (Mimi Kristy Day, for someone). Stacey flew into town, having just gotten off a great phone call from one of our local clients. She said she was absolutely floored by Valentine’s party. Not only was she sending tons of love, but Emily Michelle had already taken her seat on the floor. Kristy, who is absolute queen of the house, rolled her eyes and pretended like her finger had turned from a notebook to a camera.

She was the first one to say, “Vee vah….” followed by, “Well, I hate that. I hate it when people don’t give us the marching orders,” she added, dropping the Valentine party and moving into the bedroom.

Kristy is absolute queen of the house. Like absolute queen of the Universe. Believe it or not, a person who is absolutely (as I have often said) unbeatable in the Universe is one that even looks at ease on a Wednesday.

Abby turned away in confusion. "Oh, I can do it! I’ll get that! This is great entertainment!" she cried excitedly.

"It isn’t?" I asked with a confused expression.

"Well, yeah," said Abby.

"And it sounds like it will be fun," I said. (I had thought it would be pretty.)

"It’s a mystery, isn’t it?" asked Claudia.

"Nope. You go, Abby. Mystery."

"Fun? What? Are you serious?" Abby began grinning.

"I won’t tell anyone — I don’t even want to tell you," I assured her. "I’m serious. It’s a mystery."

"How did you even know that was going to happen?" Abby asked.

"Well, what I’m worried about is your homework, Rebecca. I’ve promised to tell you about it shortly. It’s a mystery. It’s serious, really."

"It’s serious?" Claudia asked glumly.

"Seriously. Talk about suspense!" Abby exclaimed. "I wish I could go and find out what happened, but I can’t. We’re going to be back this Friday with Dawn, Kristy, and Stacey. The suspense is going to be killing me. It’s totally serious. And it isn’t."
