 us one. I didn’t look too pleased. “You need a shower,” I cried.

“Thanks, Mom!” I replied, and we went inside and made our way to the kitchen.

“It’s not the rain anymore,” Kristy said.

“It’s so bad!”

We sat there, all hungry, watching the rain pour in on Saturday. We were having a little problem with the family, after all, and we’d talked about it. I just kept on thinking about it.

“You know you could call me in the next fifteen minutes and say, “I’m almost fainted,” I said.

“How about if I go upstairs to the bathroom and get on my bed, then get on my feet, stay on my head, then go downstairs and get on my knees?”

“Oh, do you want me to change into my usual clothes or do you want me to wear these outfits? “Nope, just turn back on your clothes,” I said to Mary Anne.

“Well, I’ll keep on getting my head stuck in the mud, and then I’ll be off.”

“And your feet are sticking up,” Kristy said. “We’ll be okay.”

“Well, maybe you can call me in that second. “Oh, do you want me to sit on my head or on my feet and start going downstairs?”

That’s all it took to calm me down. I didn’t want anything to feel uncomfortable. I just had to keep my cool. So that afternoon, we’d each try something new. We called each other on the phone and then called Mrs. Cooper back, who was rushing into the house.<|endoftext|>
Mary Anne, who was out of our meetings these last night, was making her way down to Stoneybrook Avenue to check on Kristy. We were in the process of clearing out the junk food, and she was holding a carton of icebreakers across the street. "Can I pick this up?" she asked me, looking at our bikes. She was holding it open as she passed Mary Anne and Stacey. Kristy, of course, could be a troublemaker, but I thought I was free.

The BSC meetings can really be like this. Kristy Thomas is our president and founder. She’s the one who set all the rules. She was the one who came up with Charlie’s “club policy when we first started the club, and for four years we used to have to keep all the BSC members organized. But now everybody’s getting together and practicing it all the time and getting the club record book. We don’t need a bunch of baby-sitters anymore, but most of the dues go for new equipment, new transportation (for Mary Anne to sleep, for the icebreakers to take down the flyers, for snacks, and for the snacks, and for the kids who don’t come to meetings), new things for the kids to eat, new things for Kristy’s mom to help with, new things for the club meetings to start, new rules and regulations, and everything. Plus she has these great ideas for things to make our meetings more fun, like “club meetings with fun, fun faces, ” a fun theme (like the Pits), and “new things in the world, ” and a new way to meet the kids.

“The BSC has a lot more work to do," I said. “I’m getting used to it — it’s more fun to be up here.”

Kristy nodded, and Mary Anne giggled. We sat there, on either side of us, listening as her sister, Mallory, told me a few stories about her family (Mallory’s father died when Kristy was in grade school, and her mother died when she was a baby of David Michael and Sharon), as well as our phone calls to other BSC members, including Jessi Ramsey, who is the newest member of the BSC, the oldest member of which is Stacey McGill. All of us laugh together.

I’d had the perfect time telling Mary Anne all about the meeting so far, but I hadn’t had a good laugh at all tonight. I’d just been thinking about the Krusher boys. One day, maybe, we’d be a clan of Krusher puppies. Mary Anne was excited. "The Krusher kittens go hungry," the Krusher brothers teased.

"So are the Kr
