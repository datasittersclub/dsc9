, the idea is that by offering special treats, like pizza to Stacey (the BSC treasurer), we can help us out. It's great fun. Besides, pizza and candy make me happy.

We put some fliers in front of our houses, and we each hand out flyers. We also advertise with fliers, so that when people see us, they know they can reach us easily. (We can't charge people to read fliers to other people. We usually just let them know we accept money from our clients.)

Claudia visits her dad and Mr. Bruno a lot. He still lives in a mansion across town, and the place is decorated, too. Claudia's mother is a high-school dropout, and her father, a super-rich millionaire, used to live there before his house changed forever. (Mr. Bruno still lives in the mansion.) Claudia and Claud are best friends, but at first it took them a while to find out who Mr. Bruno really is.

Claud has this big mouth, and she gets it because she knows what she's getting into. She's the knockout, and I wouldn't be surprised if she ends up with the BSC award for Best Overall Organizing.

Kristy Thomas is the president of the BSC. I don't think she can describe how impressed I am with her. I mean, it turns out she's really smart. And she knows the rules well. For example, Kristy insists her rules be enforced. (I don't mean to sound conceited, but if these rules are clear, why wouldn't everyone?) It's because of her creative nature, though, that makes me so incredibly happy.

Kristy's father wasn't at her house that day, though. In fact, he lived a few blocks away. Her mother died when Kristy was just a baby. I'd probably never met Kristy, but my mom was probably dying to be a part of a baby-sitting company. It was a lucky thing that Kristy's mom met Robert, since he and Kristy really got along from the time they first met.

Kristy's mother doesn't have an extra heart button. Sometimes she puts her head down.

Kristy's aunt Cecelia lives with the family, too, although she still seems to live in the house in which Kristy used to live. (Mr. and Mrs. Longbourne have recently remarried, and both are wonderful.) Even though Kristy's mother and aunt are gone, Kristy's dad still lives with the family, and I can only wonder what his future holds.

Kristy's younger half-brother, William, has a better answer to my Aunt Cecelia than mine. He's Dawn Schafer, also known as Mallory Pike. Mallory and William are best friends. They spend every other weekend together, and also at their Mal's house. (Dawn lives at the Schafers' on the other side of town.) I have a feeling that neither of them is concerned about their parents' closeness to their families and that's just what they do. And not so for the Stoneybrook Beautification Project. That's right, Dawn's mom died when they were little, and I know every little thing about Mrs. Schafer. But even though we know, we don't know much about Dawn. For one thing, Dawn is shy and sensitive and very sensitive. I can understand how Dawn felt because she's truly grown up over time, and I admire how sensitive she is. She has a big mouth and is the kindest, most caring person I know.

Mary Anne's dad died a long time ago, and the only other parent who could help Mary Anne with the BSC was Mr. Spier. So Mary Anne was the one who found out about her dad and brought Mary Anne and her family together. Then, it looked like a disaster, but when it did, it was a great change from the time one family was in crisis before. Mary Anne and her siblings learned to look for a father after Mr. Spier was gone.

Mary Anne and Dawn are close. They share a love of horses. (As I mentioned, Dawn is a junior officer in the BSC, and is used to sitting but is used to driving a car.) Mary Anne is a tomboy. When Mary Anne's mother first set her mind at horse training lessons, Mary Anne was all for horses. They were not exactly on the wild side before Dawn moved away. But there is more to Dawn's personality than shyness and love of riding. You might think she'd be a good student, but she is. Instead, it's easy for her to feel overwhelmed by things like schoolwork and driving, and she's used to dealing with other people and feeling overprotective.

When Dawn moved away, Mary Anne became the first person who seemed to recognize her. We've
