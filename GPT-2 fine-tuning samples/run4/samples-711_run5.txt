======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 of Kristy’s oldest baby brother, David Michael, who is a man. (Kristy and Mary Anne both adore horse stories.) Kristy has red hair and freckles and dresses in really silly clothes, but overall she’s still pretty cool. She just turned forty (she’s almost thirty years old).

Now Mary Anne looks just like Kristy’s mother! Remember that when Kristy said Stacey had to wear makeup? She and Kristy were definitely becoming close. Kristy is a diabetic who has to be extremely careful about what she eats. And it’s almost impossible for Kristy not to become extremely sick if she doesn’t follow a strict diet, follow a strict doctor’s prescription, and follow a regular, controlled diet.

As soon as Kristy became home that day, Stacey came home from school, picked up her homework, and — voilà! — she was home.

We all just sort of ate at Stacey’s. We all looked at each other with an amused giggle. That’s because, as someone who loves to eat health food and has always wanted to be known as a super-healthy person — which is always the case with me — it was pretty gross.

As we were eating, Mary Anne came in and started talking loudly and loudly to tell us that Jessi and I were late, and that we had to hurry.

Luckily, Stacey was out of school and all but impossible for the first time since she has a very heavy schedule, so we didn’t see her much of a baby-sitter. After that we invited Mallory and Tigger Mallory’s younger brother, Isaac, but also Dawn and Claudia’s parents and junior friends.

We’d mainly concentrate on Stacey and Jessi, since they’re best friends. We also invited all of the associate members (those we’d countenances we sometimes don’t have to attend meetings) to come with us when Stacey got home from school and do our jobs.

And that’s all!

“Hi,” said Claudia, which meant she was waiting for us. Claudia is the vice-president of the club and one of the original members. “This meeting will now come to order,” she told us. (The club has two members — me and Jessi. We use the phone number Claud always uses. The vice president is always Mary Anne, which means that she answers the phone during meetings and at baby-sitting appointments. Mary Anne is Kristy’s other long-distance best friend.)

This meeting of the club was my first real job during a long time in Stacey’s life. I had heard that Kristy and I were the two best friends we could get along, that Mary Anne had made a big impression on me (she always seeks advice from her doctor), that I didn’t think I had any business whatsoever until I got to know Mary Anne better.

But there was more. I thought that — after watching TV a lot — people would get used to me because I’m very serious about my job. Actually, I’m just kidding. Let me tell you about my job.

I sat in Claud’s room during our Friday meeting and listened as Kristy, Mary Anne, and Claudia wrote down important things they had seen on the pictures they were going to send us. I wondered if they’d still like me as a baby-sitter if I weren’t so busy with my job. They didn’t. I made good use of the time and the phone that they had given me, starting with an appointment with my dentist for Andrew, which is basically my first baby-sitting baby-sitter — that is, since he’s two years old — and changing the baby to sit for Kristy (which, as you know, isn’t usually a problem). Then, after we’d made the appointment and eaten lunch, Kristy had to tell us about his new family, including a set of new orthodontist practices. What was most amazing was that the baby had already been born and was learning to sit and move around. After he and Kristy had enjoyed dinner, I made up a little tradition for him. (I had a plan, but I didn’t tell you how it went.)

I didn’t tell you how to do an alphabetical list. It sounds simple, but you’d know it to be very, very difficult. So I told you how the Baby-sitters Club was organized and how it went from there.

“We meet for the Monday Dance,” Kristy announced.
