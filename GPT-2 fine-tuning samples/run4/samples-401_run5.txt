======== SAMPLE 1 ========
’d want to make one for me, but Kristy wasn’t sure what to do with it. She said her grandmother had been born at a different place on Earth. I have no idea how she survived on so much stuff. Also, the color red and the size of Kristy’s palm, and the fabric of her skin, and even the color of her hair.

Kristy is sort of a math whiz. Her mother had taught her to think, and that’s what made a perfect math whiz. The reason Kristy likes math is that she loves it. She likes the fact that she is not just a genius; she is very sophisticated. She likes to write and draw, and is seriously talented at it.

But the best fashion design idea the BSC can come up with is one she came up with herself. Kristy thought of it one day when her mom was trying to find a sitter for Jenny. (The BSC is a family-run business. That’s how Kristy got the idea.) Mom wanted a sitter who could take some baby-sitting jobs and then call one number to reach seven reliable, responsible, reliable, reliable sitters all over the town. Now Kristy thought, how do I do that?

She decided to spread the word and reach several hundred clients. That was when she got the idea for the BSC. And she had no time for waste. Then one day she met her good friend, Stacey McGill. They had known each other since they were babies. Stacey had recently moved to Stoneybrook from New York City, and she and Kristy thought maybe it would be a good thing for their company to have a meeting here in their new place. They talked for a while, and then Stacey decided she’d made a great friend and was ready to move back across town to live in her neighborhood. So they were very much in love with each other. They found something that was as simple and simpleton as Kristy’s story was.

The BSC was Kristy’s idea. Her idea was a new kind of business meeting place. In a year they were almost out of money. The original idea was her idea, too. To meet in a cool little office and have a good time. Stacey and her friends thought they had a great idea and they are all happy now.

Stacey, of course, lives in New York City — she lives there now with her mother. She’s from New York City, and she and her family have a lot in common. They’re both from New York, and they’re both just like me; they have brown hair, glasses, and so it’s difficult to describe them and to tell which is which.

Before Kristy got into the picture, I would have thought that her dream would be to be the first BSC member to ever get married, have a baby, and live in the same house (except that that was before Kristy’s family moved to her new neighborhood). She and Kristy’s mom worked hard to get Stacey married, and when they found out she wanted to move, Kristy became so mad and crazy, she decided to move back to New York. Why not this place she dreamed of? I have no idea.

But Stacey is, well, an original. I haven’t even told you the story about how she came to the idea of being the first BSC member. We all know it’s not so unbelievable. She lived and breathed her own life in the city. A lot, I think.

Now we’re back, in our new headquarters, right behind Claudia.

“Hi!” Kristy called as the phone rang. Her first job at SMS was as an information officer with the New York branch of the BSC. Then, just about every Monday, there were three calls a week. Each one was about a job she was asked to fill. The calls were very personal. Kristy had to call one number just to collect the phone calls, and none of us was really sure what the job was, but she sure didn’t want to cause any trouble for Kristy. Kristy and her BSC were the first ones to become used to regular phone calls. So they started meeting twice a month. One call per month and then another one every two months.

If Kristy and her BSC have never been more different, that was because they were so different in a much more personal way. Kristy had this cool idea for the BSC two years ago. Not only were they going to be regular sitters, but they were planning to put up signs in public places around town telling us to "Go West" in case of a hurricane, or to march in the rain or snow or whatever
