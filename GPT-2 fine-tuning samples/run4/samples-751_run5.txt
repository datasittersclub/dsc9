 asked Mrs. Kilbourne to get a divorce. Mrs. Kilbourne, who happens to be divorced, moved out to Stoneybrook with her daughter, Karen. (She’s seven and a half now.) Mrs. Kilbourne sees her father every other month and commutes to work.

Here’s how Mrs. Kwan came to her choice of husband, what Mrs. Kwan refers to as the Baby-sitters Club rule: one sitter per parent, a notebook for each job. Kristy dreams of someday writing in the notebook about every single sitter. Reading it would be helpful in case someone needed a sitter during a nonmeeting.

The BSC president, Mary Anne Spier, is Kristy’s best friend. She’s a math genius who is also shy, a sensitive person, and the most serious person in the entire universe. She believes that if you are serious about a person, you are pretty, that you are sophisticated. Kristy doesn’t believe that, but she does know that a person takes herself seriously. Her clothes, her way of dressing, her taste in foods — you can change one thing and be in a different restaurant the next. She believes — with some careful thought — that you are someone other than what you are.

Kristy’s life was not easy when, just a few months ago, her mom died, and her younger brother, David Michael, who had just turned in his report card, went missing for good. But Mrs. Spier pulled together a tiny family — Kristy, her three brothers, her one stepsister, and one pet — and made a big difference, going to a nursing home. (They’re called Emily, but you would never mistake them for real sisters.) By sitting for her parents, Kristy and Claudia found comfort in each other.

Before long, Dawn Schafer and her parents had become friends, and soon after that happened — it happened — Mrs. Schafer moved to Stoneybrook to live with her father and her mother. (Her father left the family recently, and Dawn and Mary Anne thought they were really good neighbors.)

But after Dawn moved to California, her life not only took off but also grew. Dawn’s ambition was to be a writer and illustrator of children’s books. So, of course, her family is busy. But now the BSC is busy. Some of the people who have helped it do well aren’t good at juggling kids.

The president is Mary Anne, who rose to do the impossible and win the BSC’s charter in the middle of a row. She got rid of two associate members — Kristy and her best friend, Stacey McGill (another good friend of ours, but a former associate member) — because they tried to fill in as many positions as they could.

Anyway, when Dawn’s parents realized they needed another sitter, they asked both Mary Anne and her father, for help. They got it. They call it raising money. With help, Stacey’s mother, Claudia may say it, she got hooked.

Kristy was the club treasurer until she moved to Stamford, because all the time she was a wild card. (She can be mean at times.) She keeps track of the money in the club treasury, in boxes in her bedroom. Her idea of keeping track is this huge, red, stackable notebook with information and numbers in it. Once in a while, when a math problem demands it, she plans a fun project. For example, she could write down the number in the book plus one after the other. She could show people where to look for math books, and she could calculate the result right there in the book. I think that kind of stuff makes you sick. But, mostly, it makes you calm.

Claudia, on the other hand, does not take problem solving too seriously. She’s a fantastic artist and sketcher, always dreaming up new ways to make a picture of a city. Today she used one of her great new canvases she found in the shop, made from daffodils woven together from tiny papier-sasquatch bubbles. It looked like it was made from a jungle flower, like the one at the beach in Perm. What a way to spend a beautiful afternoon!

Claudia paints, draws, sculpts, makes jewelry, you name it. That afternoon she was in the art section of the gallery, at least for a moment. For me, that was probably the greatest artistic achievement of her life.

Stacey had dragged Claudia into the job, by putting her down in the director’s chair. But she seemed to be doing a lot of sitting anyway, so Claud simply drifted off to the side.

Stacey is the treasurer because she’s a
