, from one side to another, you could see each of them holding something. And then there were the many more. They all had little kids and lots of money to spend.

My wife and I had lived our lives together in our kitchen for years. My parents divorced in 2009 and I left work and moved to a house I was living next door to. (The house is owned by David, who's wife is married to the CEO of Google, Marc Garneau, CEO of Facebook, and David's former manager of Google.) I was at my best in the morning at a restaurant, where I used to hang out and read, and at lunch in my room the next morning when I'd eat at McDonald's. I would do all of this in a day. I'd go for a walk and check on my little friends, and it felt like a long day at the restaurant.

A few days after moving in—I think it was about a month before we'd be back on track—a friend suggested they go the extra mile to the local Wal-Mart to check out our groceries. They were right. We'd spent all night in their store, shopping for all kinds of things about our favorite snacks. (I mean the kind of things we were looking forward to looking for.)

My brother made the mistake of telling me that I had to get in the way of the rest of the family. (His mom said, "That does make it bad for them.") So I got in my pants instead of a dressshirt. And I got in a dress and pulled our kids pants down, too. (Well, I really did say it.) I guess I just wanted to show everyone that I could still be a mommy in a way that I couldn't be a dad-wife. But I didn't feel like I was taking up too much work.

I think we all were at the same time, but then we all got together: I wanted to be an illustrator myself, though to be fair I did try on many other projects, but I felt I'd mostly been doing it as a hobby. I'd been doing everything from art to writing to photography. I wanted to be a freelance photographer. That was one of the great things about my time.

And then there's the fact that I got to call my dad. I got to meet him when I was still married and in elementary school. I'd made it known that I didn't have many friends and wasn't sure how to be more helpful. In fact, he's so funny now that I could tell he would be laughing. I didn't realize it from the way he looked. But I was still not sure the world is ready for me.

I don't know him much though, let alone who he is to me. I didn't find any information on him on the Internet. I had never gotten to see people online before, but you would hear a lot about him. He might have had some kind of connection to a lot of people.

I know he's from Louisiana too; that might be why he had moved into my hometown. He's been in and out of our family's New York City apartments for a long time now. He's already been married before—two kids in the family, and one daughter in New Jersey.

I was always a little sad to miss him. His mom would say he'd be a great mom when she died, but I knew the truth: I love him. She never looked back. I want him to be my best friend. She also wants him to be my best friend. She wants him to be more self-effacing, more thoughtful, more caring, and more nice, to the point that most things will be the reason she leaves.

I know him because I sent the pictures with the caption, "I always had a little trouble with him." And then it was. I sent the picture with no indication of that. What's it about that, then? I haven't been back to work in days. (I guess my mom always says, "I can do something for my kids.")

My dad is an artist, so why wouldn't he be an artist, too? But still, I don't think I'll ever get over my feelings about him. I want to help him stay strong, strong as long as he can. That's where I want to be a model; to find my mom and tell her what life is like in her place for him and our families.

That's how it works. What I want to do is help with my own family. That's why I think I need my first dog. Not something I can control; to be able to stay healthy for the life of our dogs; to be like my mom, who is the best dog person I've ever met. (Because, well, her parents are really good dogs.) That's what I'm trying to do as a mom.
