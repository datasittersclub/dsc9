 her parents. (I don’t think Kristy expects her to win the hearts and minds of her fellow BSC members or convince anyone to drop dead.)

To Stacey, Kristy, Jessi Ramsey, Mallory Pike, and Dawn Schafer, this was torture. I think they’d all start having weird conversations.

Kristy couldn’t understand what Abby was doing, couldn’t help it, either. She leaned across the table at the table Jessi was sitting on and began moving her leg to meet Mary Anne’s.

Kristy stopped moving and looked at Jessi. She was so excited.

Mary Anne and Abby both looked at each other and said, “There you are!”

Kristy slid into her seat and leaped forward a few inches, gracefully juggling two small rocks and trying to balance them. “Just in case,” she said to everyone clapping, “there’s going to be a new puppy class this week. Will you be on my oatmeal roll? I’ll be there!”

Claudia, Stacey, Abby, Mallory, Jessi, Mal, and I sat cross-legged on the rug. Dawn was cradling Jessi’s puppy, Mallory sitting next to me.

Abby leaned over the edge of the bed and leaned forward, peering under the covers. “Here. Now, are you all ready?”

“Ready, Nicky,” Jessi began, looking over at Mary Anne. They both had fallen asleep a few minutes earlier.

“That’s impossible!” Kristy shrieked.

Jessi and Mal groaned and squirmed around, mouths half open.

“What are you doing?” Claudia asked innocently.

Kristy grabbed one of her soft, pillow-tops, stuck it under her headband, blew on the horn here. “This is the Baby-sitters Club,” she said, popping the horn open.

We all laughed at the accident. It’s so disgusting, I’ve never enjoyed it as much as Kristy’s remark about spoiled brats.

Kristy is the president of the BSC. I call her the Impossible Girl, to be sure she knows it all well. She’s also the one who thought up the idea for the club. One day, somewhere, she was listening to her mother make phone call after phone call trying to find a sitter for David Michael. Kristy thought the parents were cowards who didn’t understand the kids.

The logical next step was for Kristy to get involved. She didn’t want any kids to sign up, but mother couldn’t bear to sit for David Michael. Not without having Kristy's number. Kristy realized that the parents wouldn’t mind if the younger kids could call her directly, and that the job wouldn’t feel so hard.

Her brainstorm worked like a charm, and the Baby-sitters Club was born.

Kristy is hardly the most graceful person in the world. She’s so graceful that she gets in all kinds of bad looks — straight A’s, knees, underarms, underarms with one leg bent, knees bent over, knees bent over in a certain way. She’s also very emotional. You should hear all about that sadistic pig scene in the movie Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

Now you know how Kristy became president of the BSC. First she convinced her good friend Claudia that the BSC, like the Pikes' other super club, the We ♥ Kids Club, were a real thing. They needed a baby-sitters club to help them baby-sit on their afternoons. Claudia agreed, and the BSC was born. It has vice-president of staff Janine, treasurer Charlie (her old boss), and treasurer Dawn — Kristy’s best friend, the quiet, sensitive person at the top of her lungs. Kristy’s boss’s head is destroyed by a case of mono.

Kristy used to be the only BSC member with a steady boyfriend (a tall blonde named Robert), a nice suburban dad named Russ, and a kitten named Tigger. (Robert is now in an average mood, just like Claud.) But it seemed as if the BSC was going to be a dead ringer once again. The girls decided they needed a baby-sitter. So they invited Jessi, a friend of Kristy’s, to join.

Like most great ideas, the BSC ideas just carried on going strong (and lasting) despite all the problems they faced.<|endoftext
