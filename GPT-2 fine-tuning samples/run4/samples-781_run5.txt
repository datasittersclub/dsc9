 long and more sophisticated than the other ones (I think part of the reason is that she grew up in Manhattan so she can’t exactly recall all the time). And she still keeps her neat looks. She has the most incredible blonde hair you will ever see. And unlike Kristy’s dimples and gigantic nose, her eyes aren’t as red as Kristy’s, and she doesn’t wear glasses. In fact, she always wears contacts (she has the most contact lenses in the whole world).

I was pretty excited when my BSC friends showed up at my house. We invited them to come and see how my Shyamalan-looking (I’m so used to that word) house really does work. After all the practice we’ve had, we’ve finally convinced our hosts to let us stay. We still have a long way to go, though. We call this the BSC Year Zero, because we saved our year there.

Here’s how it all works. At every meeting we’re split into four parts, so that all our jobs are distributed evenly among us. Each person is the "high energy" one (I’m down to earth, hard-nosed — that’s how I've always been known). My associate members help out when the rest of the club members are busy. We call them “rumors police” — we don’t mind them at all that much because they know us better than the rest of us. When something exciting happens to our associate and we all start hearing bad news about each other, we start making sure none of us is absent from our jobs, even if it just means splitting the club up for good. Boy, has that ever happened to me! But I was really excited about our sixth week at the Kishis’! How do they know when we’re super busy? Well, maybe because we are the oldest club in the Unified Seven Departments. We all have a lot in common (we both love to read horse stories, for one thing), but the one thing we don’t have in common is our looks — if it’s even possible to have our brown-shirt-wearing charges look alike.

We are both pretty short (with brown hair and brown eyes), but Jessi’s shorter than I am. She lives near Kristy and speaks with a special kind of sophistication, probably related to her energy and her neat clothes. I think it’s because she is a little girl, like her family consists of experienced, happy people.

Jessi has a big, big personality. She cries at anything — down to her last breath. Plus she takes lessons in a big city after she’s finished seventh grade and goes to a private school. Jessi joined the BSC as an honorary member (officially, a teen-ager, but that’s only in the past few weeks because we’ve changed). She joined the club as an alternate officer. When she was ready to leave, we advertised her — and she joined them.

Although Jessi has only been in the BSC about a week, she’s still just an eight-year-old girl. Her class size has been growing, too. But, she said, school started out the same way it’s always been: at her older sister’s house. This was because Jessi’s parents got divorced, just like my dad did. Jessi’s dad lives in an apartment in Stoneybrook, but she visits him after school every other weekend. After the divorce, Jessi’s mom was super-protective, kept saying to Mal, “I can’t … no, the divorce is too bad. Mrs. Thomas is going to live in a castle, because her husband just left us. Like all of her other relatives, she just moved here. And all the time she visits her dad. She thought he was a very horrible father, and was pretty bad about it. Fortunately she met Mary Anne’s dad, who’s a super-nice guy, though Mary Anne may have had some issues. Now Jessi has a best friend named Mallory Pike, but she wants to remain close to schoolwork and to help out with all the weekends, too.

I think Jessi could get the best of both worlds. She’s an amazing athlete, and she was the first one of us to know the benefits of regular, day-school lessons. I have a feeling she’ll be able to handle the extra work much better. Mallory has the deepest, sweetest heart. She even grew up with this great-aunt who was her stepfather and brother, David Michael. She even has a cool, curly–haired, very cute little sister who is
