. I'm still thinking up the rules. “Who should answer?" “She should. “This should come to my attention.”

I nodded. “The club rules suggest a club officer,” I repeated.

I nodded. “I’ll call back my boss before I’m fired.”

“I'm’t the only one.”

“It’s okay,” I said with a sigh.

“Hey, Mary Anne, please tell me exactly what happened last night.”

Oh, it was this last afternoon when Mary Anne came downstairs on Monday with the phone ringing. “Thanks.” Then, Mary Anne and Mrs. Stevenson came downstairs. “Good job.” I replied.

Mary Anne and Mrs. Stevenson are our main clients. So far, Mary Anne and Mrs. Stevenson look alike — not unlike Mary Anne of Greenpoint or Mary Anne of Greenpoint.

But who really made the appointment? Mary Anne and Mrs. Stevenson are really lucky to be married.

Mary Anne is Mary Anne's best friend — and our junior officer. I like Mary Anne because she’s the oldest person I know, and her parents are very, very strict, and Mrs. Stevenson is sensitive about not being able to take care of Mary Anne and her younger brother.

Mary Anne, Mary Anne’s mom, has an extra big crush on Mary Anne (I think her name means girlie); she’s the shortest kid in high school; and the shortest and most adorable person in school (because Mary Anne’s in charge of her own school). Mrs. Stevenson’s the kindest person you can imagine: neat and casual. Mary Anne’s a perfect example of that — and another one of Mary Anne’s best friends.

We call Mary Anne’s parents into business, because their kids have been taking up space on our seventh floor closet — the bedroom where Mary Anne’s mom once lived. Each mother wants to have a steady baby-sitter — one that can care for her kids and take care of everyone else, including Mary Anne. The idea for the BSC was for Mary Anne to meet one of her regular clients, and be a temporary baby-sitter.

Mary Anne isn’t a regular child-sitter at all. She comes to meetings (every Monday except Valentine’s Day) and takes in baby-sitting jobs. (She’s also pretty good at math, just as Mary Anne is best at soccer.)

Mary Anne is a genius. Her writing style is brilliant. She’s brilliant because her family is on the verge of bankruptcy. She’s smart because she’s a real estate broker, with excellent credit. She doesn’t really care about her parents and she insists on being nice to everyone, but she does need someone willing to take care of her kids as soon as she leaves work.

For example, Mary Anne came to Stoneybrook High School at the end of junior year. Mary Anne was a member of the Ramseys after Mrs. Stevenson left for New York City. They’ve been best friends ever since.

"Hey, Mrs. Stevenson?" Mary Anne said. “You’re the oldest person here at the BSC (her two older brothers — Charlie and Sam, Jr.)” The older sibling is Claudia, Mary Anne’s younger sister, and her younger brother, Nicky.

Claudia married her mother after meeting Nicky at New York City for his business. They married in Stoneybrook, and their daughter, Janine, is in sixth grade.

That’s how Mary Anne met Nicky. (She’s the oldest of Kristy’s eight siblings.) She’s very cute. I saw her smile when I visited the BSC headquarters. It reminded me of the phone ringing at the beginning of Claud’s eighth week in school. (The call was her own.) The ring rang, and Claud’s sister and Mary Anne were all ringing in unison.

"Hi, my brother! I am in sixth grade," Mary Anne said. “I should say I am.”

What would Mary Anne have thought of me? What a good job! (Well, she used to be a good dancer. I guess it’s true.)

"Claudia? Hey, did you call Mr. Stevenson? He’s a long-distance friend of Kristy’s. Kristy’s a friend of Mary Anne’s — a friend who’s older than Mr. Stevenson, and who’s
