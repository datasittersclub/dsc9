“Hey.” Kristy looked up and caught sight of Mary Anne, her best friend holding back tears. “Hey! What’s wrong?”

I’d been saying they were doing this, and I could see it in their eyes. They were trying to find something to do.”

“This summer, all your activities have had to come to order, Mary Anne,” Kristy suggested. “I don’t think you should be bringing up children for five days straight.”

“Me, too,” said Kristy dumbly, “I’m bringing up kids for two weeks at a time.”

I couldn’t help myself. Mary Anne wasn’t helping me.

“Here’s some news, Mary Anne, this’s a sad news,” said Kristy as she tried to hold onto her breath. “Your violin lessons have been canceled because your teacher decided your parents didn’t like you, and you didn’t have the proper instrument to play them.”

And it just so happened that Claud had made a good point of telling Mary Anne about the BSC and her violin lessons. Then she began making a zillion other points on my violin homework.

“For starters, Dawn would like to come to our school,” Mal said sternly. “She has a big sister and a brother. Besides playing violin, she also lives with her parents. So she’s going to be at her father’s house playing with the kids.”

“Why not?” I asked.

“It’s because Sharon said she liked the way Sharon sounded.”

“Oh, yeah,” Sharon said, with a mischievous grin. “I was just thinking about your father.”

“Oh, you mean the way he says. I can’t believe I said that.”

“Yeah, I’m not crazy.”

“He’s just a good listener.”

“I guess I am. They have to let me do three weeks of lessons,” Claud added patiently.

Sharon’s dad wasn’t going any sooner.

I knew right away. I could make that point. I’d gone around Sharon’s neck in my headpiece.

“Here,” I said.

“Oh.” Sharon leaned forward, giving Mal a teasing Look. “It’s not as though you guys are making me take lessons.”

The look was genuine.

“It’s just something about this place,” I pointed out. “This place you know well? A place I thought would be fun.”

“Oh, you know that place — New York City? You know what New York City is, too?”

“Oh. My room!” I jumped. My head was so high I almost wanted to cry. I remembered the summer back at Shea Stadium. It’s pretty cold there. But I wasn’t mad. I was really excited about spring. And my room wasn’t going to be cold all year.

“New York is a great land,” I told Kristy.

“It’s a great city,” Kristy said triumphantly.

“New York is not one of the great cities,” said a voice behind Kristy.

“New York’s the capital,” I added. “Not the least bit jealous of my brother’s arrival.”

“New York’s got a reputation,” Sharon said in a voice I barely knew.

“Your accent?” Kristy asked.

“Not really,” said Sharon. “I’m not entirely sure how to apply myself. My own style is more sophisticated.”

“Which is why you’re the “President of the United States!” Mal objected. “I don’t like being president.”

“That’s right,” I said. “I think we should use your voice.”

“How about when we sit for the President of the United States.”

“I get it.” Sharon began to whisper. “What’s the worst story in the world?”

“Dawn told me about your dad.
