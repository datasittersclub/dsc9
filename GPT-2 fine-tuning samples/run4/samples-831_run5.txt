======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 at one, I think, and we thought it was very cool. We thought the whole thing might happen when we started our club meetings in Manhattan. But it didn't. Instead, the whole thing was so wild that we had to redo things — and even plan for something — before we had a problem.

For example, we had decided on a Kid-Kit, a box of hand-me-down toys (we each have one) that we'll bring on meetings. We also had to redo our club day schedules, which are determined by individual kids. For example, we had decided on a Kid-Kit for a special group of kids who are allergic to the fruit salad, but who are difficult to sit for. We had to tie up the phone for a couple of hours at other times to make sure we weren't doing anything to the kids' allergies. It wasn't helping matters either, because some of our regular clients still have phimosis, a very serious medical condition in which the affected skin has black or brown stains from contact with water or food. We'd better run a red light if we thought that would put a person at a greater risk of developing it.

We also had to make a list of things we'd be baby-sitting for — after-school activities, movie nights, special events, and stuff like that. It didn't come easily, either. We were still in pre-poo phase (when we were starting out). But it was much, much easier. And then it was time for us to start.

We packed our bags and headed straight for Elm Street. That's where Claudia's dad used to live, but before that, the family was in New York City. The McGills had gotten off to a pretty rocky start, but things got done and ended there. So they made their way to Stoneybrook, which was a short train ride away. It was a weird feeling, actually — to see us rush into the city on foot!

Stoneybrook is an important part of the United States, and especially a big city. It was also on the BSC's wish list for a high-volume, "free" ride from Manhattan. That means no taxis and no eating cruises for the kids. It also means that with our company's help, we could begin a series of free baby-sitting meetings a week in the city.

"Stoneybrook is a small town, doesn't it?" I whispered to Kristy.

"Yes, but it's not really a town," said Kristy, not sounding like she was in need of advice. "It's more like a business, a boutique with offices here in Stoneybrook. Pretty cool, huh? The people we sit for are wealthy and working class, and they make most of the money they make from the meetings. And the kids we sit for love to spend time with their families — every little kid in the world. And maybe the best thing for them is to have a good steady boyfriend or something in the neighborhood."

"I love that town," said Mallory in a voice that sounded just like Janine. "I hope we reach seven nice kids by the time we get here, and we'll have plenty of dates to settle in for a weekend with them."

"The only part about Stoneybrook I can really plan for is the pool," said Jessi.

"It's a pool, not a pool," said Stacey with a grin.

"I don't know anyone from this city," I said. "It would definitely be nice, too."

"We'll have to talk about it at the meeting," said Kristy.

I smiled. "I've been wanting to ask you about swimming for this meeting."

Kristy nodded. She and the other club members talked for a while longer, and then I said, "Stacey, you were worried when you first moved to Stoneybrook that we might be swamped with business."

I shook my head.

"But I was just sort of hoping we could handle a lot of job demands, so I guess not worrying about a pool here is good for business." Kristy was looking amused. "And I think you're right that we're busy should be happy to be hostels. It's a good thing we're not busy when we come to Stoneybrook. We can use your hospitality when we're here; you'll be glad we're here."

Kristy smiled at me. "Well, anyway, I'd say the word 'business' isn't as important to us as 'businesses.' Businesses are people wanting to take a look at a particular place and make a decision. To think that a place like that might have a little more variety might just be the spice of life."

I nodded. That made me think twice about what I was talking about. "Business
