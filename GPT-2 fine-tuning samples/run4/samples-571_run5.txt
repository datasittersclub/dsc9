======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 mysteries of a family tree, with seven best friends. (Each of them has a sister, and the names are kept in order so they're not tied up every day.) Mr. and Mrs. McGill take a lot of the afternoon and weekend jobs, since parents don't have many kids around — they take plenty of afternoon jobs, too.

Jessi comes from part of New York City, which helps. She's an authentic New Yorker, which may drive some people crazy. Some, I think, is just too hard. I could go on and on; you are what you call yourself. I mean, you have your BSC portrait, right there in the record book.

As for me, well, my other friends don't come to meetings. But I do keep an eye out for those who're inactive. And while Kristy insists that we baby-sitter every other Monday and Wednesday afternoon from five-thirty until six, on the spot, of course.

Abby is, as she says, "a girl." She's black and about as good at ballet as Claudia is. (Well, she's good at ballet, too. See why I'm the only one with a pencil to her face?)

Shannon is really shy and domineering, and she's not great with other children. But she doesn't mind being quiet. She seems to like you way too, especially Shannon and Mal.

So that's the club. I could probably do without some of those guys, and that's okay. I'd just be hanging out with the bored, the bored.

And that's where Dawn came in. Like Kristy, she's from New Jersey. (Dawn and Kristy are best friends.) Dawn wants to be an only child, but she lives with her mother and her three brothers, Charlie (who's seven, and Sam — who's seven — are all from Long Island, just over there in New York City.) Dawn's also a health-food freak, not to mention a total health-food freak. Her grandmother Mimi was a hunk back then, and when Dawn finally met her cousin Elizabeth Lynn Mallory (she's seven and a half, and Dawn's eight) she was pleased to know that the two of them could be friends forever.

The way to Dawn's house is that if there's snow on the porch, she'll come to live there. (Not long ago, she and Mal were going to go to a school in Massachusetts that had no running track.)

The Brewers, by the way, are an independent business. If you want to set up a business, say, a house for the poor, we hand over the money and sometimes we'll just hand it over. I think it's great that our clients can rest easy knowing we're not the government doing this, treating us like slaves, toil like flies, or treating us like little kids.

But Dawn's not the only one in this. We have two associate members, Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne. They help out when we're really stretched, or if we're really out of sorts. There's an associate member named Shannon Kilbourne, too, but only as far as I'm aware.

We also have one honorary member, a boy and a girl, who don't always come to meetings, but who are nice sitters who remind us of our special friends. And two associate members, Mary Anne Spier and Dawn — who are identical twins — help out when we're really overwhelmed.

So now it's seven meetings to go!

And that’s how Mary Anne and her other friends became members of the BSC: Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne, Dawn, and me.

We were super-involved with the club. We had rule after rule (and joke after joke), and we always knew the club was a success, whether we were successful or not. Some of those successes were partly due to good parenting. Dawn’s mom died when Mary Anne was a baby. Mr. Spier did a good job of raising Mary Anne by herself — she’d happily take his place. Also, some of the things Mary Anne could buy at thrift shops had more than their fair share of problems. We tried to balance well by helping out with other things — buying Kid-Kits, stuff for our charges to bring along when we’d overbooked.

And it was good for business. We were successful because our clients — the people who needed help — loved us and wanted lots of baby-sitters, so we kept lots of clients to help out.

It was great for business because we kept doing things that we didn’t think we could do — like baby-sit. (I have never met anyone, but I bet it depends on your point of view.)
