 handle-that.

“Mmm, yooooo,” Claudia said, holding a bag with some popcorn, chips, pretzels, and some junk food into one hand and sticking her thumbs together in the other. “I’ll get the chips,” Claudia said after the snack she was distributing.

I’d eat as much junk food as I could in ten minutes, but I still didn’t want to get my eyes wet with the huge bottle of St. John's Cross Milk.

Claudia started to scoop the dumplings up. “Mmm, yooooooooo,” she said. Slowly. Her thumb went over each container. Then, while she was swallowing, she turned her attention to the popcorn. “I got that,” she said. Then, laughing, she gave up and let her thumb concentrate on the popcorn. Then she handed it over to me. “That was Claudia. Mm-hmm.” She looked as though she were chewing through a gigantic bag of Cheetos.

I knew I wouldn’t like Claudia next time, but I knew she wouldn’t want it any other way. So I took another bag of St. John's Cross Milk and passed it to Claudia, and she gave herself a quick look.

I was so caught up with Claudia’s routine that I couldn’t stop fantasizing.

“Claud,” I said, “did you do anything else yesterday?”

Claudia looked at her watch, which said seven minutes to go. “I don’t remember,” she said, “but it was like eight.’

“Maybe it was a little over five,” I said finally.

I still hadn’t entirely understood Claudia’s mother’s story. Maybe she was telling me that my mother’s older brother was out in the country, visiting with two of his friends, and I was being stupid, and that maybe Mr. Claudia had been having trouble in the meantime.

“He wasn’t,” Claudia said slowly. “He’d been feeling a little bit sad. He’d got back on the bus, maybe driven from our house.” (She had to pull in after I returned.)

“Okay, okay,” Claudia said again.

“Just like last week,” “I guess.” Claudia nodded and she looked pretty pleased with herself. I couldn’t help feeling a little strange, though.

Claudia said so. After awhile, she said, she said, she turned her attention back to the popcorn package. Then she told me about her experience with Claudia.

I liked it. Anyway, Claudia and I talked about it for several minutes, and finally I said that we might go shopping.

So on Thursday, just before I went to bed, I got ready to go to work. I had just finished stuffing corn chips and popcorn into the receiver.

I went inside, and it wasn’t exactly a comfortable place, but I had plenty of space to store my stuff. It didn’t surprise me when Kristy Thomas suggested I take some of the picnic blanket over the blanket while I was gone. You’d know a thing or two about that. After all, she’s the one with the picnic blanket.

“Okay, okay,” Kristy said after I had finished stuffing some of my favorite things and watching some of the kids play tag. I picked out the picnic blanket, which I’d filled with stuffing and cornflakes that were still sitting around, plus some of the leftover onion and beans (the ones that my brothers and I always liked), cornstarch, and some dried red pepper flakes.

I sat on the ground and listened as Kristy began to tell us about our trip. Kristy used to be our secretary, so it wasn’t exactly a regular job. But now she’s back in her original position because she’d been promoted to alternate officer. That way we can take care of any job which requires more than just sitting around.

Kristy was dressed in her usual uniform, jeans, a T-shirt, and running shoes (I think). She had on a white T-shirt, which she always wears under her black T-shirt (in fact, she always wears her T-to-T count through out the day because she has asthma). From a distance, Kristy looked like the most cute girl in the world, except for her long, wild black hair and dark eyes. Kristy is pretty, but she’s not bothered by things like mine.
