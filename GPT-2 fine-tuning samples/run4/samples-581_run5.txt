 didn't say anything, instead just mused over the last picture that had been hanging in her head. Kristy couldn’t help it. “We should have been talking about it at the meeting,” she said softly. “And the fact is that the movie was about a comet.”

“Ew!” Claudia’s eyes blanched as she cried, with a lump on her head. “Pleiades!”

“Whoa,” Kristy reminded her, “did you say ‘astro?”

Claudia shook her head. “’No, it meant ‘enquiry.”

Mary Anne looked at Mary Anne. “How did you know that’s going to be a movie?”

“Did you, tell Mary Anne I’d seen it?”

Claudia’s eyes reddened. “No, I didn’t,” she admitted, “just sort of thinking about the movie and then calling Charlie and saying ‘er’s going to be late.”

“Mary Anne,” Kristy finally said. “I won’t be able to watch it all … until Charlie calls —”

I thought that was the end of the meeting for me. The meeting was over then, but I missed the first picture of it. When I looked at the picture again, I realized that it was a movie shot in a dark room with no light, and the light was dim. I tried to figure out what movie it was about, and maybe I should have looked for that picture — but I couldn’t, before the meeting started. I was in a rush, and it was all I could do not to look at it.

I tried to concentrate as much as I could on the picture and not look at the movie. The memory of seeing it was still in my mind. It wasn’t the movie, but the movie I was trying to imagine. It really was sweet. It was wonderful.

I went back to our meeting that afternoon. As I did, I thought about the story Janine told me about Watson and how she always ended up with a new boyfriend every time. She was telling me Watson was an actual millionaire. Then I remembered I almost lost my cool at the first picture, and when I looked at Janine’s picture again, something was off. It had been taken right after Janine mentioned the movie and I recognized Watson’s eye. I guess I was glad she told me so.

“I was dying to look at it,” I said. I knew it’s about the movie. I’m not a serious movie guy, so I didn’t want it to sound like some kind of sleepover or carnival. The movie is a mystery, not a mystery about the truth. You should see it. Not only was it fantastic, it’s a story about Watson and Janine’s love, and Janine’s big love, and Janine’s big love, and Janine’s big love, and the truth.

“What was that all about?” Lacking a clue, I searched around for a word. I mean, in a word. Lacking a clue. Lacking a word. Can’t you see the big picture? See Watson? See Janine? See Janine? See Watson? See Janine’s eyes? See the way she looks at Watson? I was dying. Then again, Janine has to be careful what she eats, and I didn’t want my house and my pets to look like a "barnette" while I was gone. I mean, when I’d be gone, it was too bad my parents couldn’t come back, couldn’t take my brothers back, and I wasn’t in a "barnette" about my aunt and uncle’s new puppy shop.

I tried looking in Janine’s room for the last time, but they haven’t opened a Baby-sitters Club or even put on a fair amount of ads yet. Maybe that’s why Janine won’t have any business in her name. Not that she has to.

As I said, the Baby-sitters Club is a mystery, not a carnival. Kristy doesn’t have any business.

I couldn’t help wanting to talk about The Nutcracker. Why? Because it’s not a scientific mystery. It’s a horror. It began with Watson. It’s so gross.
