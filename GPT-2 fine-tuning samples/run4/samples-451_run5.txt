======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 We can see that even at a club meeting, where we practically dance for their money, we're always talking about how much we have to contribute. I can understand how parents feel the same way, and they must be very proud of their kids. But not everyone can see the value in being a part of a club.

Kid-Kits

Kid-Kits are another of my favorite things about Stoneybrook. They're kind of like Kid-Kits, except they're really boxes. Each of us has her own set of boxes, decorated and decorated. We decorate them to keep them healthy, from snacks to Kid-Kits (which are not, like, snack bars to replace them). The only difference is that each box has a Kid-Kit. Kid-Kits are boxes we've stuffed with games, toys, and more.

Our other set of rules are dues and scheduling. We use the money we earn to pay Charlie to drive Kristy and Claudia (and Abby and her twin sister, Anna) across town. Charlie's a lifesaver in a tough neighborhood, so that money drives us to keep going.

Kristy, our vice-president, is really good at keeping track of us. She keeps a club record book on the dues, which is an incredibly handy thing to have. (We always pay dues even though we're kids, because we use the money for things such as an after-school program, which is an excellent idea since there are so many of us to whom the dues are collected, and so on.)

We also use the dues to keep up Claudia's hospitality card, which she uses to pay Charlie to drive Kristy to and from meetings. She's a big fan of hospitality. When Claudia says she'd like to dance in a musical performance, maybe soon, she's saying she'd like to be a stand-up comedian.

In addition to taking out the dues, Claudia also keeps a club notebook. The notebook is another of Kristy's great ideas — my idea of a good work flow. What I like about the notebook is that it helps me stay organized as a member, not just as a person. If I had to choose a job, I could just guess at the names, schedules, and information about upcoming jobs, instead of having to type in one long search for someone who hasn't already told me which one to expect!

So that's the BSC. Now would I have liked to see my friends at work in restaurants or bars, working or not. I think I'd liked being on duty at the BSC because I love it so much. But I really miss the BSC. That is, until the BSC's very idea came to me one afternoon when I went into a little restaurant and found a sign for a famous restaurant in Stoneybrook. I picked up my camera and shot a brief picture of a table covered crimson with the sign. I knew I would never, ever not see it. I saw it standing around in front of the restaurant, with the sign on it. I knew the restaurant must be famous in Stoneybrook, but I didn't know much about food. So I drew the sign up and went inside. I thought, Why don't I have to look into that sign? I had seen all kinds of famous restaurants, but there wasn't such a thing as a famous restaurant to begin with.

Suddenly, I remembered exactly what I'd drawn. It read, "DAILY CHARM" INF-I MADE A PAST OF JEWS.

"DON'T YOU SEW!" I shrieked.

"I know it sounds unbelievable, but I've never made a fuss over it before, remember? Even when I was taking over as club president, you seemed more like a dictator than anything."

"I know, I know," I said sincerely. "But you better take another look at your menu before saying such things to me. The first impression would be positive. The second would be negative. What you are doing is very unsophisticated. You might as well begin a dictator, okay? You have no idea how many babies and who has slept who and when. And I don't know how you know how much food you're allowed to eat. What are you giving the rest of us to eat?"

Claud shrugged. "All of us. Don't think anyone's going to complain."

"Tell me, tell me, tell me — tell me I'll be fine," I said.

Claud shrugged. "You don't know. What we eat is really up to you. It might be better if you just agreed to give me a chance and let me make a choice."

"I can't do that," I said.

"I'd better find out all right soon, okay?" said Claudia before I could answer.

She put her hands on
