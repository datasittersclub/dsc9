======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 all are in a club, a dance school, which is how she met me’s father. We became best friends, and we began talking.

I guess you can see why I feel sad. I’m sorry for the other Mary Anne Spier kids whom I’ve known and loved. I feel sad for the Spier household, and I feel even sadder for Mrs. Spier. But even though I’d like to be back in the club at least one more time, I know that I have to.

“What’s up?” Claud asked as she took the phone. “I had to make a call today.”

“I had to make a call?” Mary Anne replied without looking shocked by the question. “Oh, well … there’s nothing to interrupt. I haven’t been to the meeting.”

“Oh, don’t you have kids to look after?” Claud asked anxiously.

Claud’s Aunt Cecelia (who’s also her older brother) called from her bedroom window.

“Hello,” Madame President said, clasping her hands together. “Yes, Mrs. President. Hi, everyone.”

“Hello, please, Ms. President?” Stacey checked her watch. “You’ll miss it one more weekend.”

“I miss all the school.” Stacey replied. “That’s because I got my test anyway.”

“Who has this test to prove it?” asked Jessi and Mary Anne.

“I missed it last week,” Mary Anne said. “But today I was feeling really good.”

(You don’t know Jessi and Mary Anne well, though. They are very different people.)

Mary Anne and Jessi Ramsey arrived at about five-fifteen. Our meeting ended four minutes early.

“Do you have to wait for them that way?” I asked Mary Anne. Jessi said in a quiet voice, “I’ll wait, though, because it’s my last opportunity.”

“Thanks.” The two girls sat behind me, looking at the clock. “By three-thirty, I think,” wrote Jessi.

“I like having lots of time,” said Stacey.

All the rest of the kids were busy, but the Baby-sitters Club had been going on all morning. It was really late, and Jessi and Mallory were sitting on the floor, talking. Jessi’s mom and dad were late for a meeting of the Baby-sitters Club. I watched as the phone started to ring again, just as the phone turned five minutes late on Friday, just as the SMS started to arrive at Mallory’s house.

That’s how everybody works. They take down information about the regular clients, we call the job back to report back. Everyone is so busy that even though it’s Monday we’re all late, so on top of that we’re all trying too hard. Every day we need a babysitter.

Claudia, of all people, was probably the most busy. She’s the club president, and we all like to be bossy. That’s the BSC rule.

“That’s okay,” Kristy sang over her shoulder.

“We’ll just call it in,” Kristy added.

“Yeah, we’ll call it in,” Mallory said with a smile. “Okay, you call that Wednesday or Saturday, and then we’re free to call the next Monday.”

“Any way,” I replied. ’I’ll take it. Just remember to tell you when to call, and we’ll take care of your baby.”

Kristy and Stacey were both busy. They’re always busy, but when it comes to baby-sitting, Kristy’s the boss.

“That’s how it is,” Kristy admitted.

Kristy and Stacey are the newest members of the club. They’re seven years old and in the sixth grade, both gifted artists, both do well at school. They’re also very different in that they both love animals and books (yes, even ballet), and they both have very different interests. Kristy is a writer — a good student, but not a great one. She loves mysteries
