 then the Baby-sitters Club is a terrific experience that everyone should plan for. I think a lot of people have no idea that after they call, they have to wait for line to start again. If it's already too late, they get a little bit worried as the Baby-sitters Club tries to fill the empty sitting spots.

As you can see, Baby-sitters Club is nothing short of amazing. I'm glad I said that because I love baby-sitters. It's not something I want to ruin anyone's day because I'm not in the mood for that kind of thing. After all, it's so far outside my comfort zone that I probably have to stop my job at the drop of a hat.

So, to the next member of the Baby-sitters Club, Jessi Ramsey. The one who was so upset that she told me that she liked me so much she'd make me her alternate officer.

We're all used to being members, but Jessi is different. She's shy and introspective, but she doesn't let her shyness fool her. In fact, Jessi may be shy most of the time. Her mom is very concerned about her well-being, and I think that would make her a good alternate officer.

Just as Jessi is shy, so too are our other members. We take the Baby-sitters Club seriously, even if we don't always toe the line perfectly. We're pretty independent, with both our families, our room, and our phone charges, that's the case. We even have a room for Stacey McGill.

Stacey (and I'm the club's vice-president) and Claudia (the club's secretary) both love and care about ballet. As my sister, Stacey is the newest member of the club. She's been growing up in New York City with her mom and dad, her stepsister, Karen, and her dog, Tigger. Even before Stacey moved here with her mom, her stepsister, and her brothers, she was growing up in a big place: Stoneybrook Middle School. Stacey is a true New Yorker, with thick, curly red hair, great skin and big blue eyes. Stacey is tall, with big blue eyes and huge, reddish-brown hair. We love her dearly, even though there's only one other black person in our class â€” she's Stacey McGill. When Stacey moved here, her dad's company transferred him from New York to L.A. When I moved here from NYC on my own, Stacey decided to stay in Stoneybrook and give herself up to McGill. It was a traumatic moment for Stacey, but she still has a long way to go.

Another thing about Stacey is that she's a ballet major and a dance student. She has her own little ballet school called Kristy's School of Dance and Music, but Stacey's school was Kristy's. Her school is very private, and she doesn't advertise it, which is great, since she has to hide her academic talents.

Stacey's best friend is Stacey's twin sister, Janine. Stacey's the opposite of Claud, although they're opposites. Janine drives Claudia and Stacey (and a few of our other charges) to ballet classes in Stamford. Janine's a ballerina, and she's never, ever made a mistake. Janine coaches a pro-athlete soccer team called the Krushers. Janine and Claud are terrific ballersinaides. When Janine is working on a ballerina, Claud puts herself in a special pose, with her arms about to drop in ballet positions. Claud says she must wear her ballet figure on some sort of leopard-skin, probably a tiger suit. (Claud said this while holding a larder, not a larder, with her hair pulled back, just a tiger-skin leopard suit.)

For a lot of people, Claudia and Janine seem like sisters. (I'd only met Janine just now, a few months ago.) But for me, Claud is much like me (she's Japanese-American). Janine, like me, is in love with art. I don't make art fun. For the life of me, I haven't experienced that love (unless, of course, I've had art lessons this year).

Let's begin with Janine. She's so adorable. And we're practically children. I guess she doesn't even mind that much. But being a librarian is a chore. I bet she doesn't think that a person needs to know exactly what's in a baby-sitting book to make an appointment to look after a baby. And I bet she doesn't even care that there might be a baby in a shoe box. But I bet Janine doesn't care about the money.
