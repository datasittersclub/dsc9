In truth, the BSC meets in my room because I am the only member of Kristy’s family to have a steady steady boyfriend. (I’ll get around to mentioning that part later.) The other members of the BSC are …

Stacey McGill (she’s eleven) and Mallory Pike. They’re identical twins, born out of wedlock. They both love to read and write. Even though they are eleven, they’re both in sixth grade at SMS.

I’m sure you’ve come across some similarity between Mallory and Kristy. For one thing, Mallory is an incredibly nice kid. He studies ballet.

What’s more, Kristy has a crush on the former Stoneybrook High principal, Dawn Schafer. That’s a title that belonged to Dawn, but Dawn lost it when she tried to re-apply for that job. It was a major mistake and now Dawn is an honorary BSC member. She spent some time trying to re-apply for that position, but she didn’t hear back. It shows how lucky she is to be so lucky.

When Dawn moved back to California for good (her dad’s job) and Dawn met Watson, she found out that Watson used to be an ex-fellow member of the BSC, moved her to his unit in Louisville, Kentucky, and turned her out and her family over to him! (Watson, who is also an associate member, stays with the BSC even when he’s away. I admire this. It’s like admitting that you’re lucky when you get to know your close friends.) Dawn is super-smart and does everything right, although she didn’t seem to make much of a impression at the BSC meeting that Saturday because she used to be a counselor. Watson doesn’t seem too surprised by her talent; she’s always being polite and understanding.

Shannon Kilbourne is another similarity that I don’t know any of you should know about. She’s from Hawaii and lives with her mom (her dad’s company decided to move back here). Shannon is about a two-year-old, developed into a full-time human being about seven years ago when her parents got divorced. She lives with the Stevensons now, but I can’t tell you how long she stays in the house. Sometimes she visits them sometimes.

Like Kristy, Shannon is a BSC member. She goes to a private school called Stoneybrook Day. That’s why she is the alternate officer. (Her father’s company moved them all back to New York.) Shannon has curly, dark hair and a passion for ballet. She used to live the way Kristy does, in a nondescript house on the other side of town. Her mother married Watson Brewer, a real estate developer, in Stamford (Mary Anne’s hometown). As they grew up, they lived right across the street from Kristy, and away from Claudia. When the wedding started again, their house was no exception. They moved in together and we invited them to join the club, and now they all come full circle. They adore everything about Washington. Loud, boisterous, and fun.

I like people with large families. Shannon and Mallory are the two best friends I know. They’re alike in many ways, though. They wear different clothes, come from close families, and generally have a good attitude.

You would not believe the size of a family in Massachusetts. The sheer size of that house makes it one of the most unusual houses in Stoneybrook. I guess it is because it has a private gym and has rooms that seem larger than they are.

Like the rest of the British royal family, Stoneybrook is more rural than all the rest of Connecticut. In addition to the mountains and the cold, there is more climate change than you can imagine. I guess it comes from the fact that Stoneybrook is more arid than the rest of the Big Apple.

The last name of the BSC is Claudia Kishi (Stacey)? That’s Claudia's. It’s the Claudia that you’ve never heard of. If you were around the 1700 census (those things are on Jan. 1, 564 years ago), you would have seen the last name of Kristy’s family. The Kishis were Japanese-American, and while Kristy is very Japanese-American, Claud is most definitely yours for the world's clothes of a world away. She’s cut her hair into an almost uniform number of standard short, shoulder-length, black (or medium brown) dresses, and she’s still a pretty sophisticated dresser. Today she was wearing what she thought
