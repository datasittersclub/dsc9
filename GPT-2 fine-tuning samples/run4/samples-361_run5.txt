======== SAMPLE 1 ========
aud. She’s the oldest of four kids in the family. She has two younger brothers, Charlie and Sam, plus a little girl, Emily Michelle.

She got to be stepsister just in time. Mr. Spier called her when Dawn left at 4:29 this afternoon, just to set up dinner for six. The rest of us were there at 5:24.

It’s not unusual for us to sit at Dawn’s house after a meal. We do it every now and then when we’re free. We can’t always count on my friends to be on time. They have to rush us for sitters, which is why Dawn has to go to the movies at six o’clock or be in another meeting.

Once a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from five-thirty until six o’clock, we hold our meetings. That’s why we got to be regular club members. Now, Dawn’s mother works three jobs: driving her older sister, Anna, to her job in California a few months ago; babysitting, cleaning, writing, distributing fliers, and so on. And she buys all the junk food for our den. She bought the stuff for the price of a pizza and a cup of milk. She gave it to Dawn’s sister, Janine, who helps out after school.

Anyway, not everyone likes to eat, of course. But I can’t believe it’s Dawn, for her part. Her eyes are blue, she’s on the pill, and she speaks with perfect Spanish.

It wasn’t easy for Dawn to begin the meeting. There was one more thing that was out of the ordinary. She said she’d like to see Mary Anne Arnold, who’s in her sixth grade year. Mary Anne's father died when she was little. Mary Anne was used to her mom in a very, very sensitive way, even though I’m not sure what kind of mother she is. (That’s not the only thing she’s got in the family.) Mary Anne didn’t say she could’t sit for the Arnold kids right away, but Mary Anne promised to show up when she got home from school. Dawn said that was kind of harsh, since Dawn knows Mary Anne’s aunt, Mimi. Mimi’s a very nice, sensitive girl. She also had a great sitter this week.

As you can see, Mary Anne is a terrific sitter.<|endoftext|>
“What? What did you say?” asked Claudia Kishi as she sat down at the desk of her rival Stacey McGill.

“I don’t know. I don’t want to go out there with someone for dinner until I get home from work in time. I’m here on the job because my wife went to the doctor. I wasn’t at school that night but I saw some girls in a TV show some morning —” Claudia spoke up again. “I wonder if you have a date?”

Claudia looked puzzled. “I can’t remember. I was in class, doing some homework, and she said she was sick. Then she said she needed a stay for a little while, and you could do it.”

“Are you sure you don’t want to go out there with them?” asked Abby Stevenson.

“No. They’re not going with me.” said Stacey McGill. “I mean, Stacey is really into kids. She’s always doing new things. Why don’t they go down to the library first?”

“They would be kind of sad, huh?” said Mallory Pike.

“It’s not sad at all,” said Abby.

Abby didn’t understand Abby’s words. “Why do you think she’s a dog?”

Stacey spoke up. “I thought this was the kind of guy I’d see last night, and I didn’t know him at all,” she said. “Maybe I’m wrong. This is what he’s like. He’s not a boy, so to speak. He’s not any of the things Abby’s talking about.”

“What ” mean,” asked Kristy Thomas.

“Is something wrong because he’s not a boy?”

“Nothing,” said Claudia.

“Well, I thought he was the other side
