======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 if I had to move over to the next room. But I was never able to move at all. And though I've seen the other children in the room with me at the beginning of the day, I haven't experienced any of that.

Maybe the other boys and girls are just confused. Maybe I never understood. I have not been able to read much, except from one of my older brothers. The book comes with several pictures. Some are from the old English school books, a few from my own. There are a few in Spanish, French, and other languages. The books are just as interesting. Some of them are about the New Yorker. Another one about New Mexico. Well, I guess they're all about the New York Giants.

Anyway, if I get to New York I'll start writing soon. Anyway, I'm not going to do that until next Monday; so I'll call up the kids and let them know. They'll come back later.

I'll sit the rest of that Wednesday afternoon. One of them will be David. He should be in the sixth grade — and he's pretty neat. He's a natural, very good student. He knows the rules, he knows the rules of math and English, and he's a pretty good guy.

Anyway, he's in eighth grade. That's about right. He's got a really cool idea. He and his best friend Jan, whose younger brother is the first child, are going there just for that. They want a job that might be fun. They've met the best people in school. They love being in the company of kids who don't want to be the teachers or coaches around kids such as Mr. Bock. They'll give Mr. Bock a job, at least if they have a good job in it.

Anyway, Jan has her own private school, where kids come from all over town. The parents keep it private and they keep the money. Jan has the rest. They're very kind of people. They love kids and love to tell stories. They love taking out all those things and to talk about them.

Jan's mother, the grandmother, who is an art teacher, has a lot of money coming in and a lot of money going into Jan's private school — a great deal of it from the people who pay her — but her children love it. And they're so happy to be coming here. That makes her so special. She and her kids are so friendly — and so pretty. We all love her.

So Jan is really special and she's been here three years. Her parents love her — and they love how nice and caring she is. She's a really good listener and she's always happy to let everybody know about her school and she really enjoys learning a lot. (I know Jan's friends think she's a genius.)

They're all about meeting other families. Jan is a regular attendee at the club, just like our friends. She's very nice, funny, and pretty. She's very talented at what she does and she's very shy even though she's very beautiful. (We're not friends. She's our best friend.) And she loves children and she's so lucky to have a good life — a great one, too!

Anyway, Jan is a lot like every other kid in the kids' club. But she's also smart. In fact, she's so smart! She's one of the best art teachers in the world. (There are two other kids: Jan is terrific at telling stories — she likes to talk about how awful she feels being sick — and has trouble talking about the things she does well.) She's a very hard worker. She can easily lose a job — her hair can look wild. She doesn't look a part of any organization; she wears a dark and black shirt with bright red stripes.

And then of course there is her artistic talents. She loves to paint. And she has a lot of drawings, too. She really loves drawing and drawing things. But she also has a special love of writing. (I find that very interesting.) She's extremely talented in all kinds of subjects. She's also a very big art student and she loves to read and read. At one point, she even wrote the book called, "A Story About a People-Hating Bunch of People" about a person who happens to be in our club. You don't even have to read anything by Jan for that, right? Well, it's her, right?

By the way, Jan's grandmother has her own art club. It's called the Art Club Club. It's full of a lot of beautiful people and a lot of fun people. (We just call them the New York Club.) It's one of the oldest things in the club. When we started it, we had about ten members. Since Jan has her own art school and lots of fun jobs,
