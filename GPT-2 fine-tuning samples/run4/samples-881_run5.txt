 a way to keep us on the same page.

The only thing in my mind is the next appointment to our Monday meeting of the Baby-sitters Club. When that's over, I'll be gone for good. I hate leaving the house I'm in. I almost always stay in it. That's because I love it.

Kristy Thomas is the president of our club. Her motto is simple and awesome: to keep the club going, is to pull one huge over-the-top nervous breakdown after another. We all have to work hard and keep up with a BSC job, and Kristy is good at keeping us company. She also coaches a little kids' softball team called Kristy's Krushers, sort of like Little League with Bart Taylor, but without giving us any of the little things like Snickers bars.

Actually, the thing about Little League is that every team has a member with a family connection, which means your entire family, including your baby-sitting siblings, is involved. In fact, there are so many children (we have seven), Kristy coaches only two kids in the whole world: one brown kid sitting right next to her, and one black kid sitting just next to her. Kristy's also a little weird about the whole "mummification business" because after the baby is born, it is held in a box for awhile and then vacuumed up with water and some soap. When I watched a funny film about the cleaning and recycling process, Kristy reminded me a lot of how sanitized it really is. You see, the box is where the baby is kept, and the soap is usually dispenser to some kind of useful stuff, such as a snack, a cool accessory, or maybe just a hiding place for harmful materials. For someone like me, the box might seem odd, but to see everything go up and down is really exciting. (Although I do miss it when I sit in it.)

Another thing about Kristy is that she has diabetes, which means her body can't control what she eats and doesn't want to give her the sugar it needs to. You see, she always takes her medicine (fulle, I think) and she's very level-headed about it.

Anyway, it was Kristy who told me about the Baby-sitters Club, which is what she needs to keep her in line right?<|endoftext|>
I knew that for sure.<|endoftext|>
It was 5:27 on a Friday afternoon. It was a Tuesday afternoon. And the Arnolds were rattling off schematics for their children's softball game, Pikes and Boogers vs. the Stoneybrook Beauts.

Dad was flipping through the pages of the BSC record book, waiting for us to get back on the phone. He was calling about a game.

"Can somebody else start talking to me about this, please?" I said.

"Is there any way I can break in so many people?" he repeated.

"What if I break in three?" he asked.

"Three times a week," I replied. "That makes four crookers."

He chuckled. "You should see that sign."

He didn't mention that one. Nobody calls three times a week, but there must be somebody who can talk all day without making a fuss.

I turned my attention to the other end of the room. I could hear the phone ringing. I aimed the phone at Claudia Kishi.

"Baby-sitters Club," I said. "See you soon." I dialed Claud's number.

Just then the phone cut off. It rang, and I could hear the caller mark down the club members who'd baby-sit for the kids. "Oh, okay, I can see the problem," I said as I put down my order. "If the Baby Sitters Club had rules, they'd be in the business."

Claud turned to me. "How long did it take you to get that last dress change? I want to fix it in two weeks."

"Two weeks," I answered, as if it weren't enough. I was a little surprised, since I'd expected two weeks the weekend before and two weeks the weekend after. "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?"

"Uggghhh," said Claudia.

"Oh, don't say two weeks," I replied. "We'll get it fixed in two weeks, we've got lots of work already and nothing to do but wait."

"Oh, don't say two weeks," agreed Claud.

"Okay," said Kristy the instant she heard the last part.

All I could do was stare in disbelief. I could make out the straps on her ballet figure and the creaky lids in which she'd fastened the
