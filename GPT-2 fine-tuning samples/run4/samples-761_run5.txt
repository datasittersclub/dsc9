 our world’s richest and most dangerous. There are all kinds of mysteries hidden around our houses. Not only that, but a peculiar mix of deadly lurking comes from every corner as well. In fact, Claudia’s house is known as the Queen Mary of the Lost Baskets because she came up with the idea.

For years, Claudia had lived in Stoneybrook with her father, Mr. Spier. Claudia’s mother died when she was little and her father and Claud’s aunt moved in to help take care of the family. After reuniting with Mr. Spier, the McGills discovered that Claudia’s mom, sister, and brother could all be regular sisters — and that Claud could almost definitely become a real one. So Claudia tried hard to be her best friend and best friend. (I could see her doing it. She had a boyfriend named Robert Brewster. He happens to be a sleazy old criminal named Lance, who was just a regular granny. I was a little jealous, even though I know the McGills really wanted me to have the best boy in school.)

After seven years of dating, they finally got married. In time, the McGills got their pet hamster kitten, named Shannon. After that, Dawn came to Stoneybrook, and we adopted a bunch of Vietnamese children, too. And then there’s Logan, who’s now a full-fledged member of the BSC. The Stevensons live in Stoneybrook sometimes, but usually don’t stay at the school. They split up to visit after school had ended, and then Stacey moved back to New York, where she’d spent her summer.

Okay. So there is one more wrinkle. If Mary Anne is an only child (as opposed to an only parent) she gets a big lump under her nose every time she talks to her parents. She gets lots of it here, but not all of it. She has a severe allergic reaction, which she can’t control, so she has to take it every day with her. (She can’t take it with mixed feelings. If she does, she could develop a severe food allergy. But Mary Anne’s parents won’t let her eat stuff like crackers or candy unless she’s allergic.)

One more wrinkle: her sister, Janine. Mary Anne’s mom and Watson have decided that Janine doesn’t have any brothers and sisters. Janine’s dad is an actual nice boy. (If Janine had any sisters, he wouldn’t be around.) Watson has two kids, whom he calls Mary Anne. Then, while Janine was away, one of his dogs, the Terrier, died. So Mary Anne has to be careful what she eats and when. (No one ever talks to her in that condition, but it happens.)

It must be so difficult. Boy, I didn’t think I’d have room for all those members. Anyway, Abby joined the club, my second cousin, Jamie McGill. He’s an old dairy farmer, in his hometown of Stoneybrook. I’m not sure if he lives in a mansion or not, because he lives there for two years and not for a little while. (Abby is an only child, so her house is much more convenient than mine.)

Mary Anne is not an only child anymore. I was almost too excited when Abby arrived that day. She had just turned thirteen. (She and Anna are both thirteen. Abby is not an only kid anymore.)

Abby has a twin, Anna, and a sister, Becca. They’re eleven. They used to live in New York and have been there since the beginning.

If I could fit in somewhere with their own car, and their own phone number, and this was just the thought that crossed my mind, I’d ask one of them to arrange my trip to New York and back. But they won’t be able to do it. I’d have to take their job and do whatever it takes.

Abby and Anna are the same age, approximately twelve, and have the same body hair, dark brown eyes, and hair that Anna had in braids one day. They both wear their hair unbuttoned, and they talk and act only in a way that reminds me of ballet.

Abby used to live in New York City, at the time the BSC was formed. That’s where she joined the BSC, and that time she still lives here now. She and her parents still live there, while Abby’s brother lives with Lewis and Hobart and with his new community in Massachusetts. And her aunt Cecelia lives with her family too, with a visit by her boyfriend, Robert Brewster.
