 years — we hardly ever have to bring the kids home. They just come in handy.

"I bet it'll work out well," said Mary Anne, grinning. "Let me tell you about it."

That's what she always wanted to tell us. "It won’t," she finally said. She held out a big hand.

“Look out!” Stacey yelled.

The children quickly leaped from their hiding places and ran after them. Mary Anne opened the door, followed by the other kids. The front door opened soon after they came in, but they didn’t bother and instead ran down the stairs.

I keep telling you all about the BSC, you’ll wait until I tell you about the members. There’s one member that I won’t touch on, but I prefer to refer to it as a club: Claudia. Claudia is the vice-president because she has her own phone, which means she can answer any phone call that comes in during the sitting day. She has become known around the neighborhood.

Like most of the members of the club, Claudia has no interest at all in art except maybe illustrating her clothes or making jewelry. She’s happiest when she’s creating or practicing. She’s a great artist and you can tell she really wants to be a famous artist in the city someday. She has a good eye for illustration and she does all the work herself.

Claudia is absolutely gorgeous. She’s slim with long, graceful legs, creamy skin, jet-black hair and enormous dark eyes.

The best part? She has a boyfriend! Not long ago she and her family moved into her old, old farmhouse on Burnt Hill Road. Not long ago, she and her mom divorced. Claudia had grown up with Mr. Spier and her dad, which wasn’t easy, because her mom works full-time and Mr. Spier commutes to the city and part of town to work in his office in New York. (Plus, she hardly ever hears from him.)

When the divorce came, Claudia had no family, just Mr. and Mrs. Kishi. But everything changed. She found just her former best friend, Dawn Schafer, back in California and got a baby-sitter! (Boy, was that dance class music — I mean, dance. She was dying to have a turn-of-the-century-meets-mystery-music-do-it kind of concert.) Her dad fell madly in love again and married again, this time from long-distance California. Claudia and Dawn, who was their age with lots of time on her hands, decided to rekindle their love interests and reunite in order to get the baby-sitting service back in California. (Dawn had originally planned on coming back to Stoneybrook to take care of the kids, but her parents said she couldn’t go because she was sick and needed to be in the hospital.)

There are so many more things Claud and Dawn have in common. They’re African-American and they’re both the oldest kids in their families, and they both have a sense of style. Dawn’s style is sleek and urban, while Claud is more laid-back. She dresses extremely casually, puts on her makeup, puts on her jewelry — that’s it.

All of the above are true. Some people are overprotective of Dawn. Some people are even jealous. But most of the time, they are selfless people. They are glad the world was round the same way as Claud and Dawn is glad the world is round the same way. (Boy, is that kind of jealous.) It’s nice to be part of something so successful.

“Hello, girls!” called Claudia.

Kristy glanced at the clock. It was 5:28.

Mrs. Kishi was sitting cross-legged on the bed. (Look at that curly, reddish-brown curly hair! It’s on the dryer.)

“Hey, Dawn, what’re you waiting for?” I asked.

Dawn smiled at me, but she wasn’t holding back. As I was explaining, I felt a little uncomfortable, because my friends were all wondering what the fuss was about. I suppose I could excuse myself, just for the day.<|endoftext|>
“Dawn, what’re you waiting for?” asked Mary Anne.

“Nothing,” I replied.

“Dawn, what’re you waiting for?” asked Claud. “You said I’m the only one in group practice this week and then I decided that
