“We need help now,” Kristy said. “We could call the Baby-sitters Club in six minutes!”

“I really’m interested,” Claudia answered.

“Are you ready,” Kristy asked, when it became clear what she meant.

“I’m going to get my glasses off and apply some polish,” Jessica remarked. “I’m still really serious about getting some in this week.” (It was only the second time she’d been in the BSC.)

“That’s great,” Abby said.

“I’m all ready,” Claudia said.

“You are going to come, Jessi, you are going to be all excited.”

“Come soon,” Jessi called.

“I’m ready,” I said excitedly.

“Jessi, I’m going to be all excited!” Kristy called after me, and so was Mary Anne.

“Come, Jessica,” I said excitedly.

“What’s this supposed to mean?” Jessica asked.

“It’ll mean I’m looking forward to being treated like a toddler.”

“Well, it isn't really something that’s in the cards,” Mary Anne explained.

“It’s like getting out of bed and thinking about your baby-sitting problems right now,” I explained.

“Here it is,” Jessi Ramsey’s mom said. “Just a minute.”

Jessi is the newest member of the BSC, and the newest of the eleven associate members. She took the job of being an associate last spring. It’s a new job, although, which is how Claudia got her associate. The girls meet each other three times a year at a club meeting: at Dawn’s house, at Emily’s. Then it’s the club’s busiest time. That’s because Jessi and I have a little sister together called Shannon, who is seven. It’s hard to believe, but it’s true. Her real name is Shannon Marie, and her two-year-old sister is Claire. Her family is huge. In fact, Shannon and Claire live there every other month and a half. Not to mention, her father is an executive very rich. The only family that doesn’t live in her bedroom are her two children. The Ramseys’ aren’t crazy about pets. But they don’t sit for them. Even so. One day they do. They just got a new sister, Anna.

“That’s the main point about me!” Jessi said, pulling Claudia’s sweater under it. “”

“What kind of clothes is this?” Mary Anne asked.

“I’m a fashion designer.”

“Okay,” Jessi said. “But’t not clothes.”

Mary Anne picked out all kind of fashionable, interesting clothes. She said she’s a fashion designer because her parents never let her get her “new clothes” and the last time she did she used to wear a pair of leffed-up, leopard-skin clothes, the same thing.

“What was your new shirt?” Jessi asked. “Stickers.”

“Hey!” Claudia exclaimed. “Where’s the Clue?”

“What?” Stacey asked.

“What?” I began to cry.

“The BSC is a new form of organization,” Claudia told her. “No one is above the pressure. And you are right. We’re lucky enough to have one of our best members, but we’re not the newest.”

“We will,” Jessi told her with a smile. “It’s not like that. We don’t have anyone like that in our club. We are in it.”

After that, I was almost as surprised as Jessi was. That was because Shannon was the first one to show up. (I guess I was, because she’s Mary Anne’s closest friend.) Shannon is an associate member of the BSC, which means she acts as a guide (no more worrying about
