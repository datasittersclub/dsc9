 Soon. She loves to write and illustrate, though she can be a pain — especially if she's going to be a koala (a member of the American Kwee Club, another of her admirers).

Kristy, on the other hand, is the one who coaches Kristy’s Krushers. Kristy used to be the alternate officer, which means she takes over for any other person who has to miss a meeting. The BSC used to be Kristy’s job, but she handles the jobs that way. It’s easy for Kristy, and it’s even easier for her, because she has a steady and experienced clientele.

Kristy’s family life also depends on her. As I said, she’s an extremely busy person, with her BSC, Claudia Kishi’s mansion, and a California farm — all of which she lives on a mansion for the summer. Her grandmother Mimi, who also lives in the mansion, is also a regular visitor. She visits plenty, so we hardly have to advertise. Mimi has an apartment of her own in a haunted house.

Another thing that makes Kristy such a person is her nose (it’s the thickest part). That’s one of her neatest features, which may be why she’s such a good sport dresser. Kristy’s wild hair is always pulled back in ponytail, which is something she has to do to make it look cool. She loves to tie her black leggings and turtleneck together with black belt buckled leg corsets. She doesn’t wear much jewelry (no jewelry from her old neighborhood), but she does have a few unusual hairstyles. Black out, pale blonde out (in another coincidence), and then something funky involving red stockings, short black sleeves, and a white head covering? It’s just a guess. But Kristy knows her look. She’s always creative, always cracking up, and in the best possible way.

One last thing about Kristy. She’s a big tomboy. That’s not a bad thing to do, since it means that you’d better have plenty of fun with her: you don’t want to be late for a BSC meeting and you’d rather be late than have to wait.

“All right, all right,” Mary Anne began to say. “All right. As you know, Stacey is coming to visit this month? All right. You will be in her room that second Tuesday afternoon after school? All right. In no time at all, my friends, I will be here. All right.” I could not stop smiling. “That was great. Would you be right out?”

“I heard it was the perfect date. My secretary said someone may be on the way that day, so I call her. Someone, that’s how I always say my name. I don’t really remember who I was calling, but I guess I should tell you who that person is, because you already know. That person was Mrs. Brewster. She recently moved to Ann Arbor from Stoneybrook after her parents were divorced. Her older sister, Janine, was originally from Long Island. Janine’s parents are certified school champs (they’re not even allowed to sit during the week, but they are super-strict about that). Anyway, Mrs. Brewer and Mr. Spier got the girls interested in an earlier role — homeroom, which involves spelling and memorizing numbers. Mr. Spier just happens to be one of those guys who is very cool and has a long commute to Manhattan. Mrs. Brewer and her kids, Emily Michelle (who’s two), and her parents, plan to adopt Emily Michelle to a new country (Malachi-Kishi-do — another one of my fave). They also have a kitten named Tigger named Shannon, and a few pets.

And that’s only the beginning. Oh, I could have forgotten about such a great person. I bet it would come down to our job.

The phone rang then. I jumped up and down in my seat, my skirt hanging loosely on my top half, with one hand on my hips and the other firmly on my knees. “Baby-sitters Club,” it said, “Come on in. My room is very uncomfortable with heavy duty phone calls. Mr. Spier will be gone for a few more weeks. Oh, and I need … oh, I can’t wait. I think I’m the only one in all of Usain Bolt’s school. This school year we’ll have to call him our alternate officer. That means
