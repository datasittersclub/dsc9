 an athlete. I'd be there the whole time. He and Watson were my sisters. We'd do things like sit for kids and go to clubs. And he and my brothers and I wouldn't touch anything else. I just sat there, waiting for him to call the shots.

"We don't have kids yet, but we'll be doing events," said Kristy, reaching for a piece of pizza.

Shawn nodded, and looked at the pizza. "Well, since we all have Kid-Kits, a Kid-Kit will be perfect," he said.

"Okay, well, we can all go and take the kids," Mom said. "We could use the pizza. Or we could take the kids." She waved to a group of friends.

Kristy and I hung on for dear life. We used to sit in front of the TV. But we have mellowed a lot. Now, we can stand at our desks and use our softball softball uniforms and our favorite softball uniforms.

After the pizza, Mom and Kristy and I sat down in my room.

"We're going to have to get some business," Kristy said. "We're talking about business with you guys! If a group of kids comes in, we have to take their kids!"

I shrugged. "Of course we've got to do that," I told Kristy. "And we can go make some money!"

"Not so much money," said Kristy quickly.

"Not such a good idea," said Charlie, laughing. "We need some more pizza money, don't we?"

Kristy shrugged.

"Well," I said, "there's two kids in the sixth grade. One of them is a puppy, and that one boy is named Andrew. The other one is a baby … but not like this."

That was probably the last one of my three major complaints.

"Well, I know it's not hard," agreed Mary Anne, grinning at us. "And I'm sure it will be a busy one. But we should be able to take a pizza party on the weekends." She gestured to a pizza box. We all laughed.

I took a bite of an extra cheese pizza. "Ew!" I shouted. I picked up a pencil and began writing on its edge. Then I wrote a picture on a picture board.

I put a picture of Andrew on the bottom of the board and wrote in the picture: “I see him — he's just a puppy.”

The kids nodded, but Mary Anne wouldn't take the picture. The picture became a picture of Andrew, the puppy. The picture became a picture of a puppy who looks just like Andrew. And when Mary Anne and Logan were taking that picture, Charlie and I were doing it right now.

"That was great," said Mary Anne.

Oh, well. The pizza was great!

We talked until 5:30, when Kristy began giving us pizza jokes. She looked at her watch clock, thought a lot of jokes, and then started to laugh. But she didn't have the energy for those times. As she talked, her face turned red. She was in a great mood.

Now I think it's time for my mom to move into the old mansion. Claudia moved into the mansion when I had to leave for college and I'd never seen her in a long time.

I have to admit, I have some feelings about Claudia — she is such an exotic woman. We're both short. Claudia also has an unusual hairstyle, but she wears her hair short. She doesn't have much in the way of style, but she does have a great sense of style (although she doesn't wear makeup when she runs late for meetings).

I have a few more theories about Claudia. I have to know her because my mom insists on keeping a notebook called "The Girl Next Door." She writes notes on things Claudia does for her.

I suppose my mom is a very strict and sensitive individual with a very high level of respectability. I'm also a strict and sensitive person who really likes my clothes.

Here are some things I think are true about Claudia and my mom:

Cute. Claudia is pretty and cute. She is very shy.

But I didn't think she would have the energy for those sort of things.

She likes to read, but she can be a bit strict with stuff like this. She has to read Mary Anne’s book, which is not very interesting. As the secretary of one of our jobs, she thinks of reading the books in the kitchen and not caring much about the books outside of a couple of pages.

At school, Claudia was very quiet. She usually did her homework, like a secretary to a teacher. But at that moment
