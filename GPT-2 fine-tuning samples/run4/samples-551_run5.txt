 mention is really her name. She’s Japanese American, and she’s always cracking jokes. Actually, her dad was always very nice to her. But she was very unhappy when her dad got transferred to West Point, and then to California, where she has stayed ever since. When she returned to Stoneybrook, her life was complicated by her dad’s marriage — and the divorce.

Luckily, things weren’t too sour. First, Mrs. Schafer was back in high school, this time with a different husband, and got remarried! Mrs. Schafer had grown up in Stoneybrook, where her parents hadn’t seen her very long. And guess who her dad used for a long time, as well. And he was rich (in some ways, I think, by his count of the contributions, but we won’t find out till later). So she and Mr. Spiers got married, and the Schafers moved into the old, spartan house. (I’m not kidding....) The whole family moved into the house right after graduation, which was a great idea! And I mean it! Just like the Spiers have stayed in touch ever since. They even recently got a cat!

Now you know Stacey, our club secretary, and our treasurer, Claudia. That’s the job of keeping track of the club’s money. (If you’re wondering what the club expenses are, you should know that we use the money for the club’s personal or special needs.) We also pay our expenses (food, clothing, and so on) for the four sitters at our house, plus supplies and stuff for Kid-Kits. (Basically Kid-Kits, you know, which are boxes we decorate or take with us after school or on rainy-day jobs.) Kid-Kits, though not a full-size box, can be a big help when we need something special or sentimental. Claudia has one. She has two in her room and one drawer at the back of her closet. And if we need to take a trip or just for some new activity, she has a great list of hand-me-downs and she gives me hers (she has one of her own in case we need to take a baby-sitting service). All of us are extremely over-protective of Claudia and her soft, soft voice. If she’s heard the saying, "Oh, come on, Claudia, come on, come on!" she whispers, laughing. Not that Claudia isn’t a baby-sitter, but she does appreciate it, and her charm keeps everything running smoothly.

Mary Anne and I are the club officers. Mary Anne was the club treasurer and is a terrific sitter. But she fell in love with me, too. She and I became friends because Mary Anne is quiet and quiety, and I like her style of dressing the way I like to wear my hair short, and she likes outfits like her old high-top, short shorts. She also likes to experiment with some of Mary Anne’s creative outfits, such as her long pants and her navy red-and-blue tie-dyed shirts.

Mary Anne has blonde hair (always short but usually in a very long tail) and blue eyes. She can’t be bothered to do any of the official driving — keep a BSC meeting or go to a doctor’s appointment, for instance. She’s very devoted to the club and tries to follow all of the club rules (unless it’s not about the job!) and even makes sure there are never any baby-sitting club business calls that fall short of our very own.

I guess you could say Mary Anne has a boyfriend. His name is Logan Bruno, and he’s a terrific sitter — but she’s constantly going overboard with him (her mom calls him "tambourine") and giving him too much attention (Mary Anne has a tough time with him). For Mary Anne to become a best friend, though, would be very impressive.

That afternoon, the entire sixth grade, I was sitting quietly, by myself on the floor. For some reason, I don’t move my legs. I mean, I’m small. My body and head form a lot of ground.

So I stood up and stared down at my desk. I took out a bag of snacks (which were neatly packed, of course) from my carry-on bag and threw them on the floor, one at a time. I noticed that as I sat, the bag was full of peanut brittle. The rest of the students were looking at me with excited looks on their faces, but most of those people thought the dust had settled.

“Hey, everyone,” said a shy voice behind me,
