======== SAMPLE 1 ========


“Come with us,” I hurried from the club room, my flashlight out, and toward the door to Claud’s house. It wasn’t nearly as dark as I’d planned on being away from, but I made sure not to get caught up on the details. “Claudia, I’ve made up with the family today. I think they’re going to need a vacuum cleaner, and a toothpaste-liter tube, and a hose that they put in Claud’s shoe box. Jessi and Mallory are holding it up. I’ve made up with them, too.”

“So?” I asked.

She shook her head slowly. (Her smile disappeared, as if it were a big surprise.)

“Mal insists on speaking her mind,” I said, checking to make sure. “Every now and then we have to make a point of speaking to each other. If things go badly, Jessi’s mom may have to call the emergency number.”

“She doesn’t want to work with us,” Jessi reminded me. “I mean, I didn’t say she was going to. And I think the club wanted to.”

“The club would have been much better off without Mal, if we hadn’t started making calls, wouldn’t we?” Stacey piped up.

“The people who care most about our clients are us,” I said. I handed Stacey our bag.

“We don’t have to advertise,” said Stacey.

“No. We’re all here because a friend of Amanda Rodowsky gave us birth,” I explained. “Baby-sitters Club!” I handed in my usual spot in the middle of the room, and before I knew it, the phone was ringing with calls from all over the city complaining about our club. I picked up my first client in the mess hall.

I hadn’t expected to meet someone so devoted to baby-sitting as David Michael. We both were, maybe, more sentimental about David Michael, since the Barrett kids we’ve known are pretty different. Kristy suggested I try the group I’d sat for and sheh she was a whiner if I didn’t pull David Michael by his hair.

Before we could ask Kristy a second guess question, I heard a familiar voice say, “Hello?”

The front door opened. In the middle of the den were Jessi and Mallory.

“Oh, hello,” I said.

“I am David Michael, your best friend in the universe.”

“Better call Claudia and say hello to Jessi.”

Jessi and Mallory were already looking at the clock. I checked to make sure it was a Monday afternoon so they wouldn’t be late. “I’d love to baby-sit for Rebecca, Mary Anne, and Carolyn. I hate to break it to you, guys, but they look like baby-sitters.”

I knew the brothers I didn’t like were all boys, except in sports. That’s where I should stop and say I’m sorry about the idea. But I think it’s the truth. This is my story. I’m eleven (the boy in the picture) and totally bonkers about being a thirteen-year-old boy. I haven’t even told you how to spell Rebecca and Mallory so well that I’d barely pass out. This is how my story will start out: That day, as usual, Kristy was at the office of “The New York Post” and Mary Anne Spier were co-workers (Jessi and Mallory were eleven while I was three). Mary Anne is dumbfounded. Maybe she just loves kids. I don’t know, maybe she’s just a bit more grown-up than the rest of the girls. Actually, I thought that Mary Anne really missed her older sister, Janine, who had just arrived in town. Mary Anne is about as sensible as you can be. Mary Anne became the first person in the whole world to believe that the only way to have a happy baby-sitter was to have a perfect one. (True believers sometimes ask why she has to go to Stoneybrook Middle School and seventh grade and study hard for a million and one tests.) Anyway, Mary Anne’s other big passion is writing. Her interest in writing has just been tremendous.

Mary Anne is really into letters, especially the ones she’s
