======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 we thought we were going to go to dinner there and not be able to make it to the meeting. I thought it made us look bad. No-one had made a mistake. We were there to sit and eat for all our clients. The restaurant was booked up and ready for a special dinner.

That was how our meetings worked: we each took a bunch of our jobs plus one other one of our clients and sat for them. Those jobs went right out the window once we got to know Kristy.

One thing that I think I'll always have a big memory of is the day when she and Dawn moved into my old house with Dawn, Dawn's best friend. Their mom had moved here from California, and my grandfather, Watson Brewer, a millionaire, owned the mansion. When I was really young, I lived in Dawn's family. Then I lived with Dawn and her brother Jeff here in his own old farmhouse. I guess Kristy did some of her stuff with her own money, but she and Dawn had plenty of other things around them. The only thing that didn't bother Dawn was Mrs. Pike. We were pretty close, and Dawn and I talked a lot. But that day, when Dawn left, something in Kristy’s mind went wild. He felt weird that she hadn’t given him one of her baby-sitting jobs, but I felt guilty and even guilty that Dawn hadn’t given him the job. I wanted to take it as a bad sign, but Dawn had given me a hard time. She said that it was something that she never did, and she had a lot of regret about that. And I was even more ashamed. Dawn was so shy, and I thought she was a spoiled brat. But I was glad she had given me the job, which meant that all the time there was left over for me.

Kristy was in Dawn’s room with her dad and me. She was putting a couple of boxes of popcorn in her backpack and tossing them in the air. I was in the director’s chair, which is an old, old kitchen that had been used for nearly forty years. Dawn had thrown away all the tissues and tissues and tissues and stuff, so she didn’t have much work left to do. She was thinking about how she was going to eat the popcorn and the tissues and everything, since she was going to have to be super-foody.

Kristy was sitting in the director’s chair, next to Claudia. “Okay, so let’s get this all set up. Let’s get everyone ready with a pizza party. Then we’ll have some pizza parties. We have the food, but also some pizza parties. We’ll put together some new shows that we show kids to help them learn best practices during the new show. We’ll bring the kids. Plus the club.”

“That’s it,” I said, making sure I kept my voice organized. “Let’s start it up!”

I could feel my friends’ minds racing as I said that. Kristy was taking pizza and popcorn before they started. They’’re usually busy with their movies and their crushes on TV shows and everything. We’ve all had pizza parties, and we all had crushes on TV shows and TV shows and other things. So why don’t we start putting together some new shows? Well, I think we can. We’re all experienced in that department. We can show our kids about TV shows and other stuff and we can tell them about bad TV shows. But our clients can’t or don’t like what they see. So we’re going to do something new.

This might sound kind of dumb, but I have never once seen Kristy do all this. If Kristy could be president, I guess I could be vice-president. That’s one more thing that makes me the happiest: the passion and joy of having a little girl.

“It’s just that,” I said. “I like girls. They can’t be strict or overly assertive or anything like that. They are just kids, and I just don’t care. But as president, I am going to give you what you need from me.” After a few minutes we settled down and listened to each other discuss things like our club record book, where the money went, and what was going on with the club.

“Well, you know, there’s something you could tell about your friends and the world?” Kristy suggested. “There’s the fact that you’re not good at math, either.”

“Okay.” I
