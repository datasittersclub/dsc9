 that she is a strong independent and not afraid to face her experience telling the truth to people’s best friends.

That’s how Mal and I became friends.

Mal started out with only two holes in her right hip. She also loves to eat healthy food like real kids. (She’s good at both things — so does the BSC’s most recent BSC member, Mallory Pike, who also loves healthy food.) But Mal is really good at everything she does — from making us all junk food fests to helping to stables at our school’s cafeteria.

Mallory is African-American. Some African-Americans find that even calling attention to certain problems is enough to drive most African-American people crazy. It wasn’t that African-Americans weren’t concerned when the Stoneybrook Sun-Times ran a frontpage story in May that found Tamir and six of his friends in need of baby-sitting help. It’s funny, though, that some people are so squeamish about having to share information about their troubles with the paper. But when our club needed another reliable, experienced baby-sitter, we found it in Mal and me.

Mal came from a great family. She has seven brothers and sisters. She does everything she can to keep things organized, so she isn’t swamped. It’s really easy for her to figure out that there’s a problem, but she doesn’t speak up too loudly until it’s too late. But we all know that if Mal’s mother tells a parent her kids are formula-free, that child isn’t going to behave. And if she says so, that’s a good sign, because our club has been coping pretty well lately. Our clients know we’re very organized, and they’ve been extremely understanding and helpful.

The BSC’s summer is now almost over, but it was a good time to start with. We had a great time getting to know each other, since there were so many people, and as you might have guessed, we weren’t the only ones excited about our new clients. We weren’t the only ones excited about twins Andrew and Jordan Ramsey. After our meeting at school ended, we were treated to a short but lively debate about whether there were any pairs of best friends. Kristy was the loudest one and made up the entire debate to try to win the debate. The debate went in the paper, where it was until 5:30 when we found out that the debate was in fact in Kristy versus. Stacey volunteered to be the lead in the debate and Abby was Natalie Tenney. The Grangers and their dogs were at my house one day when the debate started, when the Ramsey family was getting ready to move to Connecticut and when David Michael was giving us a rough tour of Connecticut.

By the time we got to Claudia’s, my room was decorated with sculptures of horses, mummies, cats, and people’s clothes. When David Michael was there, the rest of us were dressed in my short art style. Claudia has her own unique way of looking at things. She puts junk clothes in whole she’s bought things she doesn’t need, her go-to: off-the-rack little stuff that’s so gross, you’d think it must be gross — but nobody has ever put a dent in it. When she was here Mary Anne and I were so dressed up that nobody but Kristy could tell that we’d seen our Father that day. That was the beginning of our friendship again, between Kristy and Claudia, and it looked like it would last forever.

The meeting was over by the time we got back to my room. I felt as warm as I’ve been in my whole life — whether I was on that cold Connecticut day, or when the dogs bit Emily Michelle’s ear.

“My sweater has been completely rinsed and dry,” said Claudia, after gluing the sweater to her sweater.

“My sweater has been totally rinsed and dry,” I added.

“My coat is as fine as your coat.” Stacey added.

“My coat has been totally rinsed and dry.” Stacey marveled at Claudia and Mary Anne wearing their new hats and coats.

“My coat has been totally rinsed and wet.” Stacey noted.

“My coat has been completely rinsed and wet.” Stacey noticed all of us were smiling and giggling and wanted to be perfectly calm while we’d beamed with happiness.
