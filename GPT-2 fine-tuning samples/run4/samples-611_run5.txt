"You know what the BSC would be? I'd be president, chief executive officer, treasurer, secretary, alternate officer. Imagine a day where all the official BSC members could put their heads together with a single phone call, in no time."

Everyone was talking in tongues and sometimes on cell phones at the same time. "Just kidding," said Kristy, as if they were talking to each other. Claudia smiled. She was thinking of what was in the notebook.

"Then they could go into our meeting to do their jobs!" cried Abby.

"Oh, no!" said Stacey.

"Well," said Mary Anne, "we can't do that now. Maybe when the war is over we'll be able to find a director, I think." (I have to admit I kind of like Mary Anne’s ideas.) "I wouldn’t know how many jobs there are till we hit on them. It would take a million to find out."

"Oh, if only we could spell it out more," said Dawn.

"Yeah, but what about the other five-somethings we meet?" asked Mary Anne.

"Well, they might be available to help on rainy days."

"Wait, what?" said Mary Anne suddenly.

"Five-eight — I have three brothers, Charlie, Sam, and David Michael — and they’re here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut."

"I know," Mary Anne admitted.

"Good. Now we’ll be heading back to the lodge, Claudia." She sat down cross-legged in her director’s chair, her usual seat.

Our appointment clock clicked. We reached for the phone.

"All right," I said, "I’ll call you back in one second."

When we hung up, Mary Anne sounded as if she were going to call me back in one second.

Claudia’s the BSC’s secretary — I know I would love to be her replacement, given how long she has been as the club’s stand-in. But she’s acting like a ghost. Not only that, she’s not the first person to appear in a lodge room, like Claudia told me when we started the BSC. Mary Anne is the only one of us who has a steady boyfriend.

The BSC meets six times a week, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, from five-thirty to six. Members can only use the phone during those times (unless it’s for sitting), and the BSC is probably one of the worst around (unless there’s a fight, for example).

Stacey McGill, the club’s treasurer, usually shops at the BCT. “I don’t shop at all,” she said. She looked at Stacey with an expression of complete disgust. “Why wouldn’t they go on a sleigh ride in the hills?”

“That would be fun,” Mary Anne mused. “It will lead to lots of sleigh rides.”

“How would you know?” I asked.

“You would.”

“And it would be your duty as treasurer to collect dues in person. If we go on a sleigh ride, no one can ride a pony without doing a haymaker.”

Stacey didn’t sound like Claudia or Mallory, but she was pretty sure that no-one would want to go on a sleigh ride, and she was right.

“But what if we use up the funds we have to spend?” Stacey wanted to know what she would do if the phone rang and everyone decided to pull the same haymaking stunt. (The phone would probably signal that a lot of people would be able to ride horses.)

“If we pull a sleigh ride, we will pay for hay for everybody,” Claudia said with a smile. She waved a hand — probably to signal everybody — and we started marching. Our current position (with Stacey) is that Stacey can take the job. She says this because the phone never stops ringing. We’ve had to make do with a whole bunch of haymaking materials, but I really like Stacey, and if there’s ever a need, we call. I guess we will pay her.” (Claudia is a real haymaker.)

Then Stacey answered the phone with a very serious expression and pointedly didn’t.

“Whoa!” she cried. The man didn’t even have to try to work the job.

“Are you sure you want
