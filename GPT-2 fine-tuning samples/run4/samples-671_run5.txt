 thawn and wake up in her room early, too. The house is small since the members don't meet every next Monday, but it's packed anyway because Stacey visits the beach on Sundays.

Jessi, who is African-American, is a ballerina. She's also really strong, with terrific straight back muscles and perfect posture.

But a dancer doesn't always have to wear ballet-style clothes. Mallory and I used to be totally frisky, but nowadays we're much more mature. I know Jessi, so I guess it doesn't surprise me to see it wouldn't be the case.

Mallory has dark brown eyes and shoulder-length jet-black hair. She wears glasses, and she even looks sensible, as you'd expect. She's an excellent ballet dancer.

Jessi's best friend is Stacey McGill, another BSC member. Stacey's a New York City girl. She's an associate member, and doesn't attend many BSC meetings because she's an associate. That would make her a regular BSC member (although associate doesn't mean not required to attend).

As associate, Stacey's not required to attend meetings. She's a regular member because the BSC meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from five-thirty until six, and she has to take her sitting job on that day. Stacey is also very smart. For example, she could make three hundred million dollars, and she could put the same number on the advertising campaign she does.

Jessi's best friend is Claudia. She's a valentine-watcher â€” a genuine collector of authentic, artistic, artistic-looking Thomas-Margo gold bars. Claudia has a real art-school bent, and she's always putting out interesting entries for the New York Post. Claudia's always smashing up a manila envelope.

Claudia's best friend is Mary Anne Spier of the BSC. Remember how strange her parents became when she moved here? That's right. They gave up their house (well, for the next house, maybe) and gave Mary Anne to Dawn. Mary Anne became her stepsister, and now she shares Dawn's soulmate, the late Kristy. I'm sure it makes Mary Anne feel even sweeter.

There's another difference between Mary Anne and Claud. Mary Anne is white. You see, Claud is white, of course. And because she's from Africa, she's only a baby in some families. But Mary Anne's skin color is half-black and half-white. She and Claud both share one dream: seeing their parents reflected in the most important portrait in history, the portrait of a five-year-old African-American (Dawn, by the way, is Mary Anne's best friend).

Claud dreams of being a grandmother someday. She's going to be a first-grader, like Kristy, and she wants to be a famous artist. Then she has a really talented younger sister named Mallory, a baby brother named Squirt, and an aunt named Emily Michelle.

What's most striking about Mary Anne is her beauty. She's an artistic genius, and has an incredible expressive talent. Claud may be small for age nine, but in her full, flawless body, Mary Anne has the figure, the grace and the grace of a ballet dancer. She has long, pale blonde hair and a creamy, glossy blue eyes. Her clothes are just average quality, but she makes a great dancer in a dancer's show.

Claud, as I've told you, wears glasses, and Dawn wears a T-shirt and little-kid gloves. But, as you know, Claud doesn't. But boy, do I miss my friends in this family. Maybe that's why my parents were so worried. That Friday the Krushers play at SMS, they asked for permission to have contacts. When that turned out to be granted, Claud and her mother drove Claud to Stoneybrook for a pizza party. There, in the snow, she fell, sprawled across the floor. Like her mother, Claud has to wear her contacts. But she doesn't.

Claud's father was killed in a car accident a few years ago, and his mother has never been back to live in Stoneybrook. Now her mom and Claud's father are only having a hand in Claud's death. And because Mr. Spier is dead, he (Lucy Bruno) plans to give Claud the Kleenex she needs to get a good, sanitary nap. (We all know what she's going to need.)

Dawn is slim and has very trendy clothes. Her mother, by the way, is an actual genius, so she has a good reading record in California. (She's talented enough to become an all-star, but not as important a name as Stacey, for instance. That alone is
