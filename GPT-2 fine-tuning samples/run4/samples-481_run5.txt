======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 being really, really, really nice when you meet me! She’s sort of the main character of Little Big Town, which is sort of what she sounds like, like, and I guess most of the time. Her brown hair is usually swept back in ponytails or a sweater but this time she has her black hair swept into her blonde wig. It looked sort of tight at first but now it’s a little more cropped to leave her quite clear.

The last member of the Baby-sitters Club was our club’s treasurer. Kristy takes care of business when she feels like it, does most of the sitting for her, and then has another job to take care of. The rest of us just fill in for anyone who is absent.

Speaking of absent members, the record book contains our regular schedules and schedules for our jobs. That means we have to keep track of exactly when we are supposed to take a sitting job. This keeps us up-to-date on our charges, not only how I’m dealing with my illness, but also the health of our clients.

We also have a notebook in which we each write about our jobs. Reading is a lot more convenient to me than writing in the afternoon. I can just see what’s coming up during the meeting.

“Good Friday for you, everyone,” said Stacey. “”Claudia said it on her way upstairs.”

Logan Bruno, who had sat on Claudia’s bed (the dues were collected quickly), listened in on the other jobs. He was about to open the record book when Mary Anne called.

“Claudia?” asked Mary Anne. The BSC’s secretary was looking at Mallory. (She usually keeps track of their workbooks with neat entries.)

“Yeah,” she said. (She was referring to Kristy, who is also sitting for Mal.)

“Claudia, you’ve got a lot of work to do,” Kristy said in a low voice. (She was referring to the fact that she could not show up at meetings until after school.)

“Your sister has one of my younger brothers, Stacey,” Logan said with a sad expression on his face.

“I’m going to go pick him up and take him to the movies at work, Mary Anne,” said Kristy, smiling at Logan.

Shannon Brannon and Jessi Ramsey came in next, followed by Jessi’s older sister, and both of them have jobs that require them to take afternoon sitting jobs. They’re best friends, sort of, but as best friends. They have a lot more in common than the thirteen-year-old girls I mentioned. They both have cool personalities. Shannon’s African-American, with big brown eyes and long, jet-black hair.

I think it would be easy to make a joke out of this, because Stacey is a member of “the BSC” and Jessi (whose phone number Stacey commutes to constantly) is a member. They have never, ever made a mistake. Actually, they made one awful one because it turned out that Logan used to be the treasurer of the club, then he quit when he realized how poor he was. See? It worked out.

But guess who the club’s new treasurer is. That happened back in April, when Stacey had to quit because she lost a job. (Her new friend, Mary Anne, joined.) Soon after that, Stacey moved back to Connecticut because her parents had divorced. Then, just then, Stacey and Claudia discovered that a long time friend of their mom had been in the BSC. They were determined to find a new friend to support their mother, and they reached Shannon when they received a phone call today! Shannon was going to try to fill in for Logan once again, but she missed her and her brother in California so much that she ended up back in her hometown, New York City.

Mary Anne and Kristy were surprised to see things from the wrong direction, then. They wanted to make things right, but the BSC was about to have a major crisis. (I was only one member behind Stacey and Logan, but only because we were trying to juggle two jobs.) Kristy and Mary Anne decided to hold the meeting in the eighth floor hallway (where the meeting was held) until after the meeting ended, and that they’d discuss the crisis — things that involved shopping, school, and pets right now — and try to get things started.

It didn’t work! In a big way, anyway. After a while, when Stacey had decided to return to New York, we started having problems again. Stacey
