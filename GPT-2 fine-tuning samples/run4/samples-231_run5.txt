======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 opinion at a dinner party when Kristy had me and Charlie, then our treasurer, sit down and do something together.

We were a little nervous. We thought we were the next ones up, maybe Dawn, but then, before they ever asked Dawn for her phone number, I had called Dawn and asked her to join us, too. Dawn, by the way, is Mary Anne's best friend. When Mary Anne and the other BSC members first realized they needed a junior member to take Dawn's place, they asked her for a sitter. (A sitting job is one of us which just goes to show that the rest of us, for whatever reason, have decided to take Dawn's job.) That's when I met Watson and all we needed was a sitter. We thought it would be fun to make some calls to the club and get a full-time job, but then, Dawn said she didn't want to contribute to the BSC at that time. She quit, but I was still in love with Stacey, and now I'm glad so much that she's one of our two regular sitters. (Stacey's brother comes to meetings to visit sometimes, but she insists on joining us because she feels her sister, with whom she loves ballet, still belongs to another school.)

I have a few other friends who share Dawn's love of ballads and Mary Anne's artistic artistic talent, but no one likes Dawn more than Mary Anne. She does a great job of being the best friend she can be. Dawn always puts in the time for the best friend she can count on. (Don't get me wrong, I don't like Mary Anne: she doesn't do that. But she does her best to be an excellent friend.) Not only does she want to be a good friend and a good teacher, but she makes us take steps to help families.

Here's a perfect example. During the Kristy Day BSC meeting she called Dawn a "little kid" and a "billy." And she didn't even know she had to do that at that moment. Dawn had already told her mom, and she needed to know that she and her father would be together as a family someday. But Dawn and her mom couldn’t let that deter them.

Mary Anne is so good at looking up to be a good friend that she's the alternate officer in the BSC. That means she doesn’t come to meetings but has to fill in if somebody isn’t available. I think that makes her an ideal alternate officer.

Stacey is in charge of the club record book. The keeper of club records. It’s my job to keep the books clean and up-to-date. I bring along a copy of every client’s appointment, a pencil case (another Mary Anne favorite!) and some coloring books.

She’s the only one of us who can read the minds and hearts of Claudia's other best friends. That’s because her mind, plus her creativity, are so impressive.

Stacey is pretty, too. She’s short for her size — like me — and has long brown-blonde hair that she keeps pretty. She dresses casually, but she doesn’t care either way, either. Stacey doesn’t care that much about clothes, though. I think that’s the only thing she’ll be better at than anyone else, despite my looks. I am the opposite. I do what's normal.

I think Stacey really has an individualistic attitude that’s not affected by all her looks. Stacey is pretty short (or at least her clothes say it doesn’t) and is very caring and kind. I have to say her clothes really put her on the map for me. Maybe that’s why Stacey takes her clothes off almost constantly. She doesn’t wear any of her favorite clothes at all. Her jeans and a T-shirt are her most usual choices.

Stacey is African-American — with curly blonde hair (which we call red-and-white-blonde, like Dawn’s), and brown eyes and sparkling blonde eyes. Stacey looks terrific! I mean, you should’ve expected her to be a great athlete.

Stacey’s family looks nothing like my father’s, or mine, or hers, except for her long, black hair. Like Kristy, Stacey’s great height and her mom and her twin sister, Becca (they’re the same color) are white. So does Mary Anne and Stacey. They’re the other half of the BSC, the BSC children.

Mary Anne had to hide her blond, curly hair from the rest of us. We knew it would confuse her, but we didn’t want to have to hide it
