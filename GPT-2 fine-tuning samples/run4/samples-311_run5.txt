Yeah, “she’s a really good friend of mine!” Mary Anne says. “But I don’t think she would ever make it if she’d been snatched away by somebody who knew her best.”

“She wouldn’t even think about it,” Jill says, holding up her shoulder to look at Claudia and Mary Anne. “”

We all groan.

“Mary Anne’s parents’ are worried about her,” Mallory tells us, as she says things such as, “Why don’t they take her on an extended stay that weekend?”

“Why would they do that?” Claud asks.

It’s hard not to think of them. I mean, I don’t see why. If the parents wouldn’t give their daughter a chance, Mary Anne would probably move to California to live with her dad, even though her parents don’t approve of the move.

“I should have known,” Claud says. "But Mary Anne would just like to live in a special place. In a special community. In a special place, but in a special place!"

“Mary Anne and her dad can’t stay in California,” Mallory says.

“So they’re going to go out with their dad in California, too,” Jill notes.

“They’ll have to do it,” Kristy assures us.

“It would be great!” Jessi insists.

“Good,” I reply.

“And it would be fun, too.” Mallory, Dawn, and Mallory plan to be in the Baby-sitters Club for at least two weeks, although it is the last two weeks of non-school activities.

I don’t see how other parents are going to be surprised to learn about me and Claudia and Mary Anne and Stacey and Jessi. They’ve been living next door to me just because Kristy and I said we were going to be away for the holidays.

Maybe I should explain how our charges got the idea for the club. The club was originally formed in my room in the spring of seventh grade, when I was just a baby. This was before we were allowed to sit at our own houses. And it was the same reason we're called junior officers, which means we don’t do much else other than sit for our friends and see who can’t baby-sit.

It was also the reason that Jessi’s mom, Sharon, was getting the idea for the Baby-sitters Club. If anyone was in a tizzy over the idea of having a club of baby-sitters, Dawn Schafer was probably the first one she followed. One day, when she saw that Claudia and Jessi thought they were being forced out of their homes — and that parents were still having trouble finding sitters — Sharon offered them the job of sitting for the Krushers in our club.

We sat for the Krushers in my room and they found out that we, too, were going to take them. At first, nobody was thrilled about that, but eventually, the kids really liked the idea of being allowed to sit for other kids. And that’s how the BSC started. We met with Claud on the seventh of every month and she met with Jessi in the first month. Then we also got to do some club jobs. That’s right, I guess. We do have some new jobs in store for us.

That’s pretty clear about the BSC. The only thing we don’t have as regular members are our associate members, Shannon Kilbourne and Logan Bruno. These guys really help out around there, in case you’ve forgotten. (I’m just going to say that I didn’t always take them on.)

That’s where the organizational record book comes in. In there, we’re sure to know how the kids are doing (and how much they’ll need) and when, and what’s going on with the club.

As I mentioned, the club calendar is in there, too. I found out that every month we have extra days off (Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays during the week) to schedule sitting jobs on our calendar. That’s a good thing too, since we all love to sit, too, since we’ve been seeing lots of sitters.

Anyway, back to the club notebook. I think I could probably write a whole book on it (so that’d be as much fun as writing a few rules or something
