 the parent club.)

The other interesting thing that happens when we meet is that we each have our own phone line. That's because Kristy's mom works (and, as I mentioned, just happens to be an awful hunk of clay). That's why it's always Kristy and her sisters and brothers and friends who book jobs when mom visits.

Kristy is gorgeous. She has long, straight black hair, which she usually wears pulled back, and sparkly blue eyes. She also has two younger brothers named Charlie and Sam, who live with her every other month. (By the way, Shannon has her own personal phone line, one that is used, well, for family phone calls.)

As VP of Organization and Communications, Kristy's the one who handles our club record book. That's a huge office because Kristy took the job because she's an excellent, experienced keeper.

Kristy has the most adorable kitten. Her brown kitten, Tigger, is the only member of the BSC to have a mother. She and Logan Thomas, Kristy's brother, love animals and don't care very much about clothes and makeup. (By the way, Logan has to work hard to be the best kitten in the world to help him learn to care for his own kittens.)

Kristy's family lives in this mansion at about three hundred feet from me. That's because her mom died in a car accident during one of Kristy's short stint in the Royal Tenenbaums as a baby. Kristy's mom just happens to own two Kia Sleeves, which she tanskily decorated at the end of each of her clothes days.

By the way, let's see, how do we meet when only Kristy can baby-sit? This is where she contacts me! It's also where I phone all the members who'd like to have a little fun. I'd say the BSC does a pretty good job of that.

I call the members of the club, and then I have my usual meeting, which is on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons. I'm the one who schedules the meetings, the one who decides who can take a job, the one who keeps track of all our schedules in our official record book. Every job is assigned to me. That's because I'm vice president because Kristy's life is her business and I'm the official keeper of the record book. I've managed to stifle tears whenever I sit on the job.

Kristy has to be the absolute best at her job. Not only does she make sure all our clients have equal standing in the BSC, she has the ability to figure out which job to fill.

How are other club members supposed to line up jobs? In a word, very well. The BSC has a president and a vice-president. Each of the members has duties to fill that role. The vice-president is usually in charge of the club record book. Usually it's the case that one of the club members has to miss two or three meetings because her room is full of work. The vice-president is in charge of the club record book. She's our only official keeper of the book, since she hasn't been able to make one official appearance in several meetings.

There are eight members of the BSC, which means that if one of them has an unfulfilled duty, we all have one. That means that the rest of us have to do our part — take jobs. In Kristy's words — "We all take our jobs when none of us is available."

The best way to describe Kristy is that she's a whirlwind. You would never guess, I think, that she spends the better part of a day on the phone trying to find an appointment for a new kid in her new neighborhood, or getting her parents' help getting a parent's permission to have a baby-sitting job. But she's also smart as a tackler and has one of her own pottery classes.

It's a good thing that Kristy has a good idea — she has the brain. She's an incredibly creative person, and even if she doesn't plan her day by day life — she could make a great assistant! I'm not going to sugarcoat the fact that she likes to be on the alert. She's always aware of what's coming on the job and what's even possible. For instance, I'm the only BSC member to have been to a BSC meeting three times as often as Kristy. (I was at my regular meeting.) What a genius!

So, you might think Kristy is a spoiled brat who is bossy and shy. But she's really shy and is great at being bossy — but even so, she won't give in to her shyness and stick around in the same room for long.

I'd tell you the truth
