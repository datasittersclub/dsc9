 my parents. I guess she was happy she hadn't been sent back to California.

Kristy's family life has been pretty different from Stacey's. First of all, Stacey misses California very, very much. She misses the warm weather and peaceful way the summer months are spent in parks, barns, and in her room.

This is true. Kristy's mom, Sharon, missed California like crazy. They couldn't wait to see her bring her little brother, David Michael, back to Stoneybrook. That would be a total lost cause. Kristy's grandmother, Nannie, came to live with them for a while. (She is really nice. It's sad that she's gone, but she's just so sweet.)

Then came my family. In my case, it was the Krushers, Claudia's twin. But back to the school year. We take Kristy on little-meets-two-sixty-five-somethings train each Monday, Wednesday afternoon, and Friday afternoons. (I used to live in Kristy's day-care center and work with her.) The other members of my class are Mathletes in Another World. They're like little brothers to me, like Sam and Charlie.

Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike are my best friend. They are such twins that it makes me dizzy and crazy to think of them as twins.

Mallory is African American. She's gorgeous. She has no taste in clothing whatsoever. She has braces, glasses, and a collection of piercings that we all adore. I adore to wear her contacts, but I think it would be gross to wear her nails and make her drawbridge into a Broadway show. (Jessi has curly red hair, and high cheekbones, so I'd say she's a tomboy.)

Mal and Jessi are best friends. They are truly talented. They solve mysteries, paint the faces of famous people, and make silly sculptures that look like real paintings. In fact, if you meet them, you might think they'd be a good artist. Mal's talents lie in drawing and fabricating things.

Jessi recently told me she loves to read, so we got along well until she started to annoy Mal's boyfriend, Robert. Eventually, they started arguing. But you never know when the things are going to get out of hand, or the friendship is going to last. I guess you just have to admire Jessi when you see it.

Jessi has a younger sister named Becca and a baby brother named Squirt, plus an aunt named Karen. (She's a California native who's moved back to Stoneybrook because of her dad's marriage. But Jessi misses all her dad. She doesn't talk much about him.)

Jessi's life wasn't always this way. Her family used to be spread out across the street from Claudia's house, yet Jessi and her family have all grown more integrated since her return. Jessi would sometimes be carried across the street by her father, who was moving out of town for his job.

As far as Jessi goes, I would say her situation was pretty lucky. In those days, Stoneybrook was a city and Jessi would be happily settling down in her own neighborhood. But soon things turned grim for her father.

For a while, he wanted to make Jessi go away to college. Well, at least Jessi turned out to be a better student than he thought her to be.

Jessi and Mal had been rivals for a while, but after a while Mr. and Mrs. Schafer fell in love, and soon their families settled together again. Mr. and Mrs. Schafer adopted a baby on Jessi's family and raised Jessi and Mal in a modest, four-and-a-half-year old.

Jessi's story has convinced a lot of people â€” but especially me! It makes me so angry that Jessi and Mal had such a big fight over her home and Mal's school choice and both of them decided to move back to New York because of their decision.

Jessi's passion is ballet, and she loves sports. She coaches an all-girl softball team called Dance for Good Young People in Need of Honor at school. She also had an acting problem. The football team was taking an absence together and Jessi could barely keep up with the rest of the charges, so she took it upon herself to train at home.

I don't know how Jessi did it, but she did it. She put in lots of hard work, but there are lessons to be learned here. Even for Jessi, a lot of that hard work seems to be paying off too.

Now that you know the rest of Robert, check out Claudia and I! I can't wait to see her dancing, singing, carrying a baseball bat into
