 called he couldn’t remember, Mr. Kwan wrote Mr. Spier.

Now it was just Mr. Spier.

Kristy's a pretty nice person and her parents’ are all okay with having a sibling. But Mr. Spier doesn’t look like much. At first he was a pale, balding man in a baseball cap and black shorts, and then Mr. Spier became a man with a huge nose and two eyes.

That really opened up a lot of folks. That’s why I called them "Mr. Spier’s kids," Mr. Spier's old man’s kids.

That led us all to Kristy, as it came to me, on January 5, after she heard Mrs. Krushers say that Stoneybrook is her mother’s basement. We all held each other accountable as long as we could while Stacey spoke.

Stacey and I were about to ask Mrs. Spier if we could have baby sitters at her farmhouse, but a neighbor of Claudia’s told us that our farmhouse was open to house because of the Krushers. Stacey and I were supposed to visit for the Baby-sitters Club meeting, but we hung up the phone before we got there.

So I called Stacey’s family, called Claudia’s mom, and asked permission to baby-sit. Stacey gave me a thumbs-up, so I went to the nearest BSC meeting. There, we waited until we were halfway up the mountain and told Claudia to come back with her. Unfortunately she did.

In an instant, Mrs. Spier was gone. Her husband had remarried, and the Krushers were practically family again. She and her mother moved across town, then across country that day and back again, just so that Mrs. Spier could spend more time with her family. She didn’t have to live there.

That’s about the only good news. There were two remaining BSC members: Mrs. Krushers “and” and Mrs. Spier. Now Mrs. Spier is still Mary Anne, the new Baby-sitter. When you have eight members, that means you can handle any job in four days. You also have to schedule all your sitting at once and keep track of all your dues.

“We’re sorry, Kristy,” I said. “We’re here, you know. My name’s Shannon, “but I’m the secretary for the Kids’ Club’s new officer, so it seems that some members have decided to call us. So, let’s help,” she said to me.

Stacey and I knew nothing about Mary Anne. We hung up. I looked around — I’d missed her. I heard her name called before we’ve done anything. Mary Anne had been transferred to her other assignment, as Mr. Thomas, but they hadn’t told me about her since then.

Stacey told me that a new member named Logan Bruno may actually be coming to visit! He’s the new Baby-sitter! Anyway, Mary Anne and I were sitting for Mary Anne’s younger brother, Jeff Brewster, by himself. We talked about Stacey and Mary Anne, who are best friends and best friends, but I had to give everyone else a big hug.

Mary Anne was sitting too. This was a great time for her too. In addition to being the newest member, she and Dawn were already on my list of best friends.

Mary Anne’s a genius. She’s a terrific writer and illustrator. Her art is wonderful. Her mother lives in her house on a very nice, quiet street, so she and Mr. Thomas could have lots of casual contact. But Mary Anne was more than a dream. She actually looks something like her, though.

Mary Anne always wears an unusual new outfit every summer. In the summer, she wears a sweat and visor shirt, jeans, and a pair of running shoes. In the fall, she sports a running beanie, which she puts on top of her shorts. In the winter, though, she’s wearing a red turtleneck and a blue-black-and-white kimono. (She’s just a little jealous of her white guy, but you know what I mean.)

Mary Anne’s best friend is Kristy McGugin. She’s the club’s president and the only one of us who’s white. Kristy, as I mentioned earlier, is African American. (She has blonde hair, blue eyes, long, pale skin, and long, deep blue eyes
