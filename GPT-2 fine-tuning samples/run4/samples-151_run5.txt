; I hope you're a vegetarian. I mean, I guess I'll be vegetarian if I can manage to do it. But it's a very personal thing. I don't think I'm any less a human being, or a dancer. I think I've got more to come.<|endoftext|>
“Is there ever a time when the sound of an apple snoring will kill you?”

I hear it every night, always as a voice on the radio in the back of the store, in whispers and dents. It rumbles, like a ticking clock, to the end: five-thirty. And it's only a few minutes before the music stops …

“That’s great!” says Kristy. She steps away from it, eyes glistening.

"Just kidding. I think the apple snoring was just a little after five hours."

"Why are you saying it was about five-thirty?"

I sigh. "I really hope the story doesn’t leave you so bored. But for now, I had better find a place for a story about a lost puppy named Cecelia."

That’s exactly right. Kristy’s the only one of us who makes that call. Her face just makes Kristy feel better. But it is a true friendship, a friendship between Kristy and Byron. It might sound a little crazy, but Kristy lives it.

As I write this, I hear my heart thump when the alarm rings. I’s sitting next to Claudia, in her mother’s room. Her little sister, May, has her own set of ears.

She’s the world’s only white baby, a baby whose color looks like your grandparents’. Her eyes are gorgeous with wilder eyes, and her hair is curly, never pulled back. The last thing she says to me when we’re finished talking is, “”

“I wish I’d get you to write in my book,” says Kristy, pushing her hands together.

I can't wait. I get excited when Kristy’s writing me stories.

“That’s one of these stories that just keeps coming. I’m thinking “Okay, Kristy, there’s a baby!” She calls the story.

I have my own story now. Kristy, by the way, is an author. And I have my own life. Some people see an author (or a baby) as a form of literature, a kind of art. But Kristy, who is also an English teacher and a ballet student, understands that when we talk about writing, we are discussing our own life.

“What do I mean? It’s hard to tell," Kristy tells me. “It is very easy to think of my little sister and her own baby. But to me her voice is much more complicated. In fact, she can't be very clear about who she really was.”

I don’t even think about any of that. I see her eyes, they tell the whole story. But I don’t know what Kristy meant by that. What she meant by my mom was that the world’s most sophisticated and sophisticated baby is just as sophisticated as her mom and me. She’s so sophisticated. She’s the only child of an entire family, and yet she’s very different. She’s African-American, she’s got braces, she’s pierced ears, she’s Vietnamese-American, and she’s a good listener.” She’s a very emotional baby. So are those other people she makes her own life.

Kristy has never dated another person. She didn’t even know that she had an old flame who was going through a divorce when she got married. She and her mom still live alone in a mansion in Burnt Hill, California, but they don’t seem to be getting old.

Maybe that’s just because they're not the same person from the beginning. Kristy, who is white, has red eyes and brown hair. She had white hair, dark skin, and eyes that look gorgeous when she looks at it. Her mother still wears a baseball cap (that she keeps on in a closet in the bedroom) every day she’s not out with the Kid-Kits, with jeans, jackets, sweats, and sneakers. This is why her mom still drives her to and from meetings in the neighborhood. (Maybe I just read that too much, though.)

You might think this makes her a perfect match. But it doesn’t.
