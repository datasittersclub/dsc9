 — a lot of time and effort, but I have it all figured out.

When the BSC was established and the Baby-sitters Club (BSC) was around, Kristy and Stacey were busy baby-sitting. Kristy started the BSC on December 5, one day after my birthday. They had gotten together, and when they were all settled in at Claudia's, they asked Kristy and me to join them. Well, Kristy and her brothers and sisters wanted to baby-sit when we were at their house, but we declined — not because we weren't organized enough to join them, but just because of how much work they put in. So one day Mary Anne (Kristy's grandmother) persuaded them to let the BSC operate without anyone but Kristy, Stacey, and my best friend, Logan Bruno.

Kristy (in an oversized blue T) and Stacey, who also lives in a mansion in Stacey's neighborhood, soon became neighbors. So Stacey, our president, started the club, and she and Kristy (and I) decided our club was the best thing for the club to do together because everyone can feel better about themselves in less than a year.

That's it. My life under new circumstances. I'm living in a real, live mansion with a private jet, a super-smart phone, an excellent dentist, and a good gym, and I'm spending more time with other members of the BSC. But I'm living in Stoneybrook because the BSC itself turned out to be a huge success. Claudia Kishi is now my best friend, and her housecleaning and appointment jobs are all over the place. I'm so happy we became friends, and that I have lots of other friends in the BSC too — such as our club members, who are both more recent — but I think Stoneybrook is a better place to live because of all these good friends.

I went to Stoneybrook High School in Stamford (the same school that has the highest rate of extracurricular activity at SMS) right after my dad died. I was also going through a tough time when my father left (he had just left, by the way, by my own account) suddenly for a little town in New York. Mr. Spier died in a car accident when I was six (I mean, in New York) that wasn't my father anymore. I remember my grandparents saying to him, "We should have known sooner, or he might not have left."

Anyway, before I went to SMS, Kristy was still living with her mom while I was in New York. When Kristy's mom arrived, her house was like an alien landscape. It looked like a jungle. I remember the dogs barking, the flies flying around, the noises of babies being born and having their minds slumbering. I did too, though. There was no way of saying it sounds less wild. My house is sort of a tropical jungle. But when it wasn't, it was a really fun house.

But Kristy was having such a wild time that Mrs. Schafer finally bought Kristy's brother Jeff for her, and Mary Anne invited the other BSC members to join the club. That left the club in a much better place now that Kristy and I don't go to Stoneybrook Middle School anymore.

So, as the club continues to grow (and I don't mean in a bad way), I need to tell you about the club members. I'll start with Kristy, who is the club's treasurer, mainly because she is an excellent speller and one of the best spellers in the BSC. If you look at her sheet, you'll notice that she's in charge of the club record book, where she keeps track of all our spending money at our individual addresses. As far as I know, she's been doing a lot of it.

The club record book contains the club's official club calendar and a calendar of all our jobs, as well as my club phone number and the job assignment information from the SMS phone book, so that we all have an easy access to up-to-the-minute information whenever we need it.

I have to admit, being a city girl the way I am a town girl is pretty special to me. I can hardly stand it — or make eye contact — with it. My father and I grew up here, on Bradford Court, next door to the Papadakises. Mr. Papadakises was a really nice guy and a really good coach for Andrew Kent (Kristy's brother), who went to Stoneybrook Community School.

We all think we're better than children, and to be honest, I'd rather be called a baby than a boy.

Let me back up. I can't spell things well. Here's what I think. I hereby declare that “
