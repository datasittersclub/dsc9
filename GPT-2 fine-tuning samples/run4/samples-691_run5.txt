 that is more of a mystery than a problem,” said Stacey McGill, smiling. “But that’s what makes it’s charm is that she’s smart. She’s used to her age, and she knows how to apply pressure to her image. The last thing Claudia wants is to have to work hard for her image. Who would believe a girl who dresses like this? Why don’t they tell us?”

Shannon Kilbourne, another associate BSC member (she’s always available to baby-sit for me), replied, “Really? … Why don’t you do it?”

I was confused. “Oh, I’m really looking forward to it. I mean, I could watch some of my favorite shows in primetime, but I don’t want an impression of her. She’s young and kind of dumb.”

“I know,” said Claudia. “But let’s see: Where’s the latest soap opera?”

I didn’t know about some of the other charges I’ve thrown around, but I didn’t mind the idea of Claudia’s having this idea. “We’ve all got stuff on the market for just about all the regular BSC members. It’s small price tags that make us very popular — sort of like what you’d expect us to offer.”

Stacey put her hands to her cheeks, looking hopeful. “That would be fun!' she said.

“Me, too. I like spending time with the kids,” I went on. “I know that would be fun. But I mean, let’s see what kind of audience Claudia wants.”

“How would you guys plan on telling her just in case we have a new show or something?” I asked.

“We could do a variety show,” said Stacey. “If we had some new business. I mean, I know she’d like to baby-sit, but I can’t guarantee that she’ll get the same reaction from everyone. Also, I don’t know if Claudia’s parents would be happy to see a new baby.”

I thought of the Baby-sitters Club, too. It’s a good thing Stacey doesn’t have any kids. I just wish she’d come up with a great idea.

As I waited for Stacey’s announcement, Claudia began to think about my question. “Would you be more interested in having a zillion baby-sitting charges in your system than a few hundred regular customers?”

My eyes narrowed. She was staring at the clock that day. “Five minutes to start,” said Claudia’s voice.

She checked the digital clock and frowned. “So this is some time before the phone rings,” she said.

“It’s almost five,” Claudia reported, clearing her throat.

“Really?” said Stacey. “I mean, I don’t know if you’d have time to complain. You have two younger brothers, Sam and Charlie, and a younger sister, Becca,” she informed meowingly.

I glared at her.

Claud’s father sat at the table beside her mother. He was in hysterics as she said these horrible things. His face was flushed and he looked awfully bored. Even now, I can’t help thinking she’d have to go to a stand-up comic or something. “That’s great, Claud,” said Dad. I hoped he’d just begrudgingly relent. I guess he’d just be out of the club altogether.

As soon as she spoke, my father burst into the room. “What?” he yelled.

I looked around. I was just about to turn my picture into a giant red flag when the phone rang again.

Clauditos!

My father was still in the room, waiting.

He looked like a high-class mail-order hag.

This was how he handled the call. I guess we should call him my dad now.

My dad isn’t my father. He is, unfortunately. But this was his reaction.

The caller said he’d be happy to take the job.

I smiled. He seemed happy to have me.

Claud was in my room. We sat there for about three minutes, listening for
