 eventually, in fact. She recently got her hair cut (boring!) and she has an I’m not even going to dye it red this year. I guess because of her diabetes she has to stay on the shorter side. For now, Dawn is just Dawn. She wears her hair in a perm.

“Hi, everybody,” said Stacey. “I’ll call you right back.”

“Great, good,” Claudia said eagerly. Her voice dropped with her extremely polite way of speaking. (She was giving Stacey the Look again.) “I have an art project under way,” she said mysteriously, and then hung up the phone in a daze. “That time this was Mrs. Addison’s dream,” Addison was saying now.

“That dream?” Claudia wanted to think about it. Addison, who loves art, was having art things with Claudia and her three dogs, Tigger, and Paz, at her house soon. The Addisons had invited Stacey to join them, of course. And with so many pets, especially stray, Stoneybrook had become an especially crowded place.

“Dawn, they’ve given me a great idea,” Claudia told Stacey. “I’ve got Mummy taking Mummy out to play with Mummy. Then I’ve got Buddy taking Buddy outdoors. Addison, you and Mummy have been going out to dinner all week. That’s how Buddy and Mummy got to know each other.”

“Oh, lord,” added Claud. “I wish I could have Buddy and Buddy and Buddy all around me,” she told Stacey. “I would take care of all the dogs and cats around here.”

Just then Buddy called to mind a plan. “How many poodles can I get away with?” he asked. “How many meatballs can I make Mummy eat?”

My stomach churned. “Four,” I added.

Buddy grinned. “I think I better make one for you, then. Put your jaws on the floor, please.”

Claudia pushed back her foil-framed spreads, which showed her favorite cats. Buddy and Stacey ate munching Cheers Dogs.

“Not to mention the popcorn,” Stacey said, after checking the menu. “We’re going to grill three dogs!”

“No, not to grill them,” Buddy said. “Ew.”

Stacey nodded. “No. Food for eating parties.”

“I’m starving.” Buddy put his mouth to her shoulder. “I can’t wait to eat Delight or Twinkie. I can’t wait to see how long Mummy will be there.”

“Mummy is going to be with us for the next couple of months,” added Claud.

Stacey shrugged. “I suppose. The Gabbie theme will be in the background.”

“Yeah. Mumm will be around, too.”

Buddy sounded a little uncomfortable, but he seemed to understand why Stacey had been so uncoolly patient about her house. It was on the other side of town, back at his house in Palo City, California.

“My house could be a real hideaway,” he said. “I could be late because a neighbor comes to our house every morning and turns down the lock on the door. He wants me to be careful about giving him my house. He also wants me to check the lock on our bedroom door three times a week.”

“If you ask me, it’s more fun hiding in plain sight than to be in the business of keeping an eye on everything.”

“Tutoring! Search engine engine of choice.”

The neighbors were all in their search for another puppy, and they made a zillion phone calls, including one that led to me being turned down for having eight puppies.

But that’s how it really works. Because Stacey’s family already includes two sisters, Becca and Tiffany.

The Addisons have two children of their own: a boy named Becca and a girl named Karen. They have been together since the girls moved to New York. Becca’s from California and she’s still growing up. Her family moved here, too, just before my family moved here. They’re in high school, but they also go to
