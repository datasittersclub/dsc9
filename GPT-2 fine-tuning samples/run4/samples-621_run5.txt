======== SAMPLE 1 ========
inarily, I would have to go to some hospital in New York, I don't know, to be treated for diabetes, or worse. There's not a whole lot in New York public schools. That day, the Kishi-do are in the Guinness Book Book records for the eighth-grade! I mean, not counting my BSC friends, who have all come to visit, I mean, except our other rivals, who have taken a whole weekend. When I think about it, it makes me queasy. But I see parents everywhere complaining about their kids' homework, and I know parents on both sides of the Atlantic say they want more time to think and care.

So I had to find a job. A full-time post, like most full-time jobs. My other two families are in a good place already, in that way. They are much less crowded than ours. We schedule everyone's appointments as they come in (my dentist appointments will be on Thursdays and Fridays, and my baby-sitting appointments on Saturdays and Sundays). We don't charge dues, but we do share a few things: food, and occasionally the money is used for something fun.

Claudia is Japanese-American, with great, long black hair. It's a beautiful ring shaped like a lion's tongue; she can recite the koans in four languages (Kazoos, Sino-Kazoos, Nahuatl, and Romanized Creeds). The best part? That she loves reading Nancy Drew books.

Mallory loves to write and illustrate her own stories. And I can tell that she can tell. As you might guess, she's an excellent student, as well as a good writer and a fun-loving teacher. As you can imagine, she's very sophisticated, and she even looks pretty cool on her big blue eyes. Mallory's family is a big part of her being a “average kid.” Unfortunately, her sister, Gilly, is as crazy about her as she is. They chose to adopt her from a new neighborhood because her dad died in a long-ago foster family, and their lives were hard on both of them.

Gilly moved to Stoneybrook because her mother raised her there. The only good thing about Stacey and her family is she came back after so many difficult years (Mallory got used to the suburbs and ended up moving back home), so she still has a long way to go. Gilly is a member of the SMS family, too (they adopted her from an adopted family). Her sister, Becca, is in high school and is going to college in order to catch her professional soccer (she is two minutes faster than the rest of the girls in the French section of the French club I went to). Jessi, meanwhile, comes from a pretty ordinary household. She attends a school in Stamford, and she studies at a school in Stoneybrook. She attends a school in the city (like Stoneybrook High School) and she does amazing stuff, mostly arts and craftss (the arts are more important to Jessi than to me) and she loves horseback riding. Jessi loves to read. She has the hardest time saying “jolly good,” because she doesn’t know anything about literature or romance until after her junior year at school.

Abby Stevenson is our newest member. She came to Stoneybrook to join the BSC and she’s the only member with a dog, so she had to be part of a pack for a long time. In addition to that, she’s totally wild about clothes — she wears wild clothes these days — plus pretzels — and Nancy Drew — that girl in Nancy Drew books — I mean, seriously, but she’s a really good writer and artist — and she can pull off just about any outfit. She even looks good in her black tie, which she’s already dying to tie back into.

Jessi’s family is a whole lot smaller than mine. She has no — her family’s got two older brothers and a younger one named John Philip Ramsey, who’s eight! And (like Mallory and I) they have a younger brother named John Jr. Who used to be incredibly important to some people in his family. Now he’s very, very very important to Jessi’s mom, who’s trying hard to make everything work for him so she can have enough kitty litter for him — and boy, do they even care.

What’s the big deal about Jessi’s family? A little. They have two adopted little sisters and a mom who brought them to Stoneybrook from out-of-the-blue Kentucky. And when they were little their mom married this old guy named ……. He married this beautiful, old woman who has a million kids and a mansion in
