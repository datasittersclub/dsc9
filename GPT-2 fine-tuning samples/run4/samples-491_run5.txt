 floor of my apartment. Kristy and I have always had a thing going. We don’t usually go out at night because the houses are crazy, and there’s just so much chaos right at our doorstep. Plus, we miss our parents, and our little town of Pike and Samos. They grew up here. Our parents moved us here from New Jersey three years ago. It was a big difference between us. We were happy here, but then Stoneybrook and New York grew up and we went back to both countries, and now Stoneybrook comes to us.

Mary Anne McGill, Kristy’s stepsister, and Stacey after her. Stacey has blonde hair, brown eyes, a nice southern accent, and a doglike air about her (she cries just from the noise in her ears). Sometimes she complains about her hair, though.

Besides being an English major and a math whiz, Mary Anne is also best friends with Kristy’s, except for the fact that they are both short. I have never been around town with Kristy’s father before, and I’m glad I wasn’t and still am. He is a very short guy named Robert, with reddish-brown hair and glasses. He used to sit on the edge of our chairs when Kristy was little. (I think he died in a car accident just before the wedding.) His car broke down. Kristy called him, but he never comes by.

Kristy’s the only one of us who has a steady boyfriend. He’s Jessi Ramsey’s mother. They got married, and Mary Anne and her grandparents moved into the old farmhouse where Kristy’s mom and Kristy’s dad lived during the summer before they got married. That was before, back in the seventh grade, when Mary Anne, Kristy’s mom, and Dawn and their dad had moved into the old farmhouse. We thought we were being let out of one of our bigger (and much larger) families. That was an awful lot to take in, but life for Mary Anne was okay. No one was seriously hurt, and we even celebrated our first wedding with some of Kristy’s old high school sweethearts.

Our home away from the Big Apple is Kristy’s house. It’s a very complicated house, because of the kitchen, and the barn (which is huge, but still stands by the entrance to the barn). I’m talking about the kitchen because I think everyone who lives there is alike in some ways and uniquely in some ways in their own way. For instance, Kristy’s black, her hair is long and straight, and her face is dark and almond-shaped. She hates the weather or the school bus, and she loves to baby-sit at night, even if neither her father nor Mrs. Pike is available.

Kristy has brown eyes and medium-length brown hair, as well as strong brown hair. She’s very shy and very direct, and she loves sports, which is what I believe helps her to be a better baby-sitter than most of the rest of us — both in school and in life. She even goes to the gym, for sure. Kristy has one leg in gymnastics, which is her only sport in the school gym. She has also recently seen more activity at the track than any other single child at school, which is important when you want to know what the real reason is — to build strength in a child whom you’ve just seen hurt. In fact, the only thing Kristy’s improved on is math. After she’s been to the combine, the boys at SMS and the club she’s now with are much better at school. In fact, Kristy has been so good that the eighth-grader she’d sit for in the club has to say yes; the sixth-grader says no! As I said at the beginning of the meeting, Mary Anne and Claudia are best friends, and they both have their issues. But I think it’s important to mention that, because they are excellent sitters, they spend very, very much time together, particularly during afternoon hours. (That’s when we have lessons, in fact. So do everybody else.)

Mary Anne, Claudia, Dawn Michael, and Jessi are our junior officers. (We are the rest of the members that way — our vice-president is thirteen-year-old Mallory Pike. She’s another of the original thirteen-year-olds, and she makes a terrific baby-sitter!) The only other member of the club is Mary Anne (who is probably next door to me on the street), and her name is Stacey McGill, but she does not belong to the BSC. Also,
