======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 was having a great time with his family. Here's how: a) He has seven younger brothers and sisters! b) His house is huge. It may sound like a small family, but the Pike kids love it. And they spend a lot of time at the houses they sit at, which is unusual, I think, mostly because of all those triplets! c) And I bet they also have lots of grudges. Kid-Kits. Kids of all kinds are part of Kristy Square, but of greater importance than any of the BSC activities. Kid-Kits are boxes we fill with things we don't need filled. I keep one each week and give them out at each meeting. Each of us has a job, and it's mostly filled with our own playthings, art projects, puzzles, puzzles, puzzles, things to amuse kids! Kid-Kit. Kid-Kits keep things organized, too: our schedules, the things we break out in our neat, organized ways, are organized, too. For example, there are boxes of books and toys in case of a disaster, along with coloring books, crayons, everything. And we keep track of how much we've bought and taken out of things, plus a notebook in which we write about the jobs we've had! (By the way, did I mention that Kristy is really into writing?)

In every category, the last word on things is important!” I called out, “The beginning of a new chapter!”

Everyone laughed.

“You guys better stop and think,” said Kristy. She was right. The Baby-sitters Club is really about having lots of great ideas, too. That was why she was president. I'm not sure Kristy is ever tired of being secretary. She just loves being in charge, which is a good thing in a mess.

The Baby-sitters Club was Kristy's idea, from the start, at first. The club was built on her idea of keeping members together, even if it was just for fun sometimes. In the beginning, meetings were held in Claudia's room because she's the only member who has her own phone line. (She's also the BSC’s alternate officer, which means she can check our nonmeeting calls in Claudia’s room at all times.)

Claudia has diabetes, which is a lifelong disease. Her parents think she must be fat because of it, but it's a pretty big fat health problem. It’s not complicated, but you know how we talk to each other when we have baby-sit requests? It’s simple. We call our clients to see if there are sitters available for the afternoon jobs. It works out great for everybody. I've sat for quite a few kids now, and I know Claudia feels fine. And she said so herself to The New York Times back in the seventh grade.

Claudia’s not the only one in the BSC. Dawn Schafer, Kristy’s mom, is the other. She moved to Connecticut when her dad’s job was transferred back to California. She lives with her dad and his New York City apartment. (I know, we live in her old house, which used to be a mansion.) Anyway, our club got its start out of a lot of club meetings. Kristy had called the meetings to find a sitter, but she wasn’t free. So Kristy asked Dawn and her friends why they needed a sitter. They said, “Because we are new parents. We don’t know how many kids to baby-sit for,” and that shocked Kristy, because they asked Dawn not only about her schedule but about her baby brother, David Michael, too, who was born in Vietnam. But then Dawn asked whether David Michael would be there for a second baby. (She had just gotten a goldfish earring for Christmas. Kristy thought she’d missed it.) Dawn even had a baby brother! That was because she was at a BSC meeting and nobody was available except Claudia, Kristy, Dawn, and me, since Claudia is our vice-president. Anyway, Dawn asked if she could sit on the baby-sitting job. Honestly, I couldn’t wait to sit on the job. Kristy wanted to know why we were taking so many kids, and she also wanted to hear from the rest of us about Claudia’s sitting jobs.

I said that we would call Claudia’s house if there was no chance of finding a sitter. I said we’ve decided to call the Connecticut branch now because we always take calls during club meetings, and because we really need someone to sit for the Baby-sitters Club members.

“I see you are ready for the club,” said Dawn
