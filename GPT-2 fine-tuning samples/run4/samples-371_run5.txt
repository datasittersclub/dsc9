By the time I had to leave Stoneybrook for the summer, I’d been talking to Logan. So I decided to check my phone. I had my usual amount of time — a week or so — to think about it. And it was only one phone call, I thought. The phone had never been that busy before, actually.

I hung up the phone and called the person who answered.

“Did not catch,” I said.

Everyone laughed.

In fact, my friend Mary Anne Spier was one of the first to call me to tell me about the trip.

She was sitting next to me on the bed that I had been lying on the floor on that day, not far from my own house.

“Hi,” I said. “I’m sitting for this little kid who’s been kidnapped and brought up here, by the Spanish.” She sat across from me on the other side of the bed. (My friend, my fellow Baby-sitters Club members, can’t get enough of Mary Anne.) “Yeah!” she said as we sat down at my desk with a couple of our regular customers. I didn’t like what I saw. I didn’t like how her dresser looked. I didn’t like her height. I didn’t like the way her hair was pulled back by her black lashes. And I didn’t like the way her eyes were so red or glowing.

Mary Anne, who is white, lived as far from Stoneybrook as possible at the time of the trip, and even though she was the only one of us who had no pets at all, she was still pretty sick when I came to Stoneybrook. We needed a quiet, geriatric place for her and Mary Anne, and Mary Anne was one of the two people we thought of.

The other choice was Kristy, but after listening to Kristy tell Mary Anne about it she seemed a lot less nervous than Kristy. Mary Anne and I were also on a different plane. We were on vacation and we were in California. We were taking care of a whole group of infants, mostly in one room. Plus, I had just had two calls with my old client, the new mother, and Mrs. Thomas.

I wasn’t worried at first, though. In fact, I didn’t even notice I was there until I heard Mrs. Thomas tell me her baby brother had just been born. I was still trying to think of some good things to say about the baby — why was he born, and where did he was being born? — but I was almost dying to find out. What’s my solution? I thought it was a good idea to be present at a baby-sitting event. I took my phone from my sleeve and listened for a few minutes. When I finally finished, I told Kristy and Mary Anne to phone me back. By then, the situation had changed. But my friends weren’t ready for Mary Anne to be so cold-hearted. They weren’t ready for me to act cold-hearted and treat people like babies.

Kristy thought Kristy was crazy, and I thought she’d become a little bossy. But as Mary Anne and the other club members talked, I thought about the time I’d told Mary Anne about the trip and the way she had treated me in those few minutes. It’s hard to imagine any of us having talked so much about my situation.

Anyway, Kristy said she hoped to have a BSC meeting at least one day at which Mary Anne would be open to new ideas.

The club was going to be in high gear. I was going to be in charge. Kristy had just called, told me they’d meet there for a while, and told the rest of us to go ahead and get ready. Then she told Mary Anne to call her father to check that Mr. Spier hadn’t already called the meeting up too late to get ready for the Baby-sitters Club meeting. So a few other things happened that made the meeting and the day go smoothly.

First up, Dad wanted to talk to Claudia Kishi about the new movie she was going to be seeing. He was in talks with her to do that, and, of course, it worked. Claudia had had an interest in this movie until they had looked closely at the pictures. She looked at the pictures before saying, “Look at my face.” Claudia looked at her and said, “I’m going to be her star. I’m going to be with the greatest star in the history of the world …”
