s like, you know, the movie I like. I always feel kind of lucky to have some artistic ability. My mother always told me to try to imitate her, and that was the only way to make a difference. I've tried, to my very best. There's nothing I can't try out.

The club meetings are on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoon hours. If you're a Baby-sitter, you have the club booked.

Mimi is our alternate officer, which means she takes over for anyone who can't make an appointment, even if it's just for a Baby-sitter. It's a hard job for her, but she comes up with plenty of sitting jobs.

Mimi and the rest of us are newcomers to our club. We don't have any official titles, but we do have our own honorary member. She's Kristy, and she's a California native — born in Stoneybrook, probably. She's the president of the BSC and in charge of our calendar — our appointment calendar. She's very organized, too. Her calendar contains all our appointments, plus our special jobs. She's very good at keeping track of it.

As we're sitting, Mimi keeps track of what's happening with our charges, what's going on in our families, and when and how we're going to bed.

I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

“Come on, Stace, let” came the alarm and all of a sudden, the room was shaking. “How are our charges?” someone was moaning. Kristy, Claudia, and Mary Anne looked at each other and tried to answer.

“Well, the bad news is that none of us seems to have any sleep this night,” Claudia mumbled.

“The good news is that Stacey is doing fine,” Jessi said.

Picking up a sharp pencil, I drew a picture of the two women, their faces flushed orange, dressed in black. The color matched their outfits, which they wore in different ways. I knew it’d have to be great, since the picture was so close. But I tried to pick out a few interesting points.

“Well, what do you think? Is Claudia the only one with an idea?” Kristy had said. She listened, and then looked as if the room might explode with activity.<|endoftext|>
"She's wearing her raincoat on her toes," I muttered to myself.

"It's a raincoat vest," Jessi remarked, waving it around. She and I used to take Mal's outfit into our outfits together, but since Jessi and I go to SMS, it was a little odd. It looked kind of cool. I'll never forget it, but it was true. It was a vest like Mal's, with a bead of orange on one braid and white on the other. The vest covered the toe of the toe, and Jessi was wearing it with a tights of green and black. (I'd never gotten to wear one toe braid before.) It was kind of cool.

"We do have an idea why the vest is a raincoat," Margo suggested. "And it might be true."

"I'd love to hear it," I said thoughtfully. "That would be fun and helpful." I think Stacey's group idea, Mary Anne's mayo pants, might be a good idea as well.

"I'd like to get to know the other girls more," added Kristy, sounding less than pleased about Jessi and me. "I'd love to see what they think."

"Sounds great," I said with a smile.

"I'd like to try this idea with another group," Jessi told me. "I'm interested in a lot."

"Oh, really?" I snapped. "Did we just talk about having someone replace your shoes at the meeting?"

"It's a great idea," Kristy said suddenly. "You could replace some of the shoes with new ones. Sort of like how the orthodontist would replace a needle in a shoe."

"I know," I said. I'd heard other orthodontists talk, but I wasn't sure which that was about.

"I think that would be a great idea," said Kristy, looking at the vest. "You might be able to replace the shoes with new ones. It sounds great, doesn't it?"

"You're right," I said. "I really like it."

"Well, you could replace the vest with an extra one," remarked Kristy, "that one that hasn't been sneezed."

"And a couple of the shoes that don't belong to me," I said. "
