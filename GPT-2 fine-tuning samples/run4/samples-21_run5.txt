re.

It started with the idea of my mom getting pregnant. I was so excited and thrilled to have my mom's baby — I'd be the one to hand them her car keys — but I was devastated at what I'd gotten myself into. Her name was Lotte, after I'd been born as a baby. I was really trying to figure out what the hell that meant.

But I knew I'd be sitting in a room that was going to be filled with babies. I mean, this is the moment I learned I was pregnant, and I was really, really excited. I was so excited to see these babies. I wasn't sure it mattered for me, because I knew they were going to be awesome.

I also knew that one of my friends had a baby, too. And that was the kind of baby I'd be.

We'll always remember my mom as the one who held the door to my room the first time I opened it. She'd left the room when I'd finished writing about her.

But we're not exactly sure who we are. Lotte died during my dad's second run, after the first of what would become our first family — the Lotte family. That would be Lotte Garten, Lotte Kristy, J.B. and J.D. (the other sisters). One family member named Lotte Luter is her father-in-law, but there is little chance that's going to be the best she can do for my little sisters.

Lotte Kristy (and Janis-Dorothy) took a month to live with her parents. I'd called her dad. I thought he was the one to call the ambulance, but he came right back. He knew what I was going to do. He was really the only one who could tell me exactly what I wanted. He said, "You think you're going to be a baby-sitters club when you get married? Just tell me. Let me know what you want." Then I got out of the house and moved into his room.

J.B. died in a car crash on Halloween night, one of the last days in a row of Halloween. I didn't know why, but I thought she was having a bad dream. For a while I was the least worried about that. My mom had to take care of it and when J.B. was still in his bed at night she had all the toys and stuff to play with. She had to take care of Janis-Dorothy's car keys whenever he called her for help. She was the one who told me that J.B. just wanted to be a big leaguer, to be in a band if possible, and not be in a band if nobody knew what she was doing. I guess you could call it one thing — I guess the biggest thing is that it just kept happening. It's just another thing in life — the fear.

After that, J.B.'s parents started to worry, and she started seeing a lot of baby-sitters clubs. And Janis-Dorothy started to feel better, too. As a result, she finally got the job of a waitress.

What did Janis-Dorothy do with all the money that came in when she moved? She decided she needed to pay all her mom's bills, and she took on the business. There's more money to cover, but Janis-Dorothy is going to have to do that with the money she earns from selling and buying art supplies. She's a pretty good dancer. She was in high school, although she's now doing the ballet school job at her age. Anyway, Janis-Dorothy has a good job, and she's the oldest one. (If I could give Janis-Dorothy a second chance.) She's the only one in the room with a baby monitor and a baby's collar, so if she needs to run errands, she has to use it. It's the reason that she had to live with family members because there were too many other family members with the same job. As long as Janis-Dorothy doesn't see her baby-sitter job, she won't be worried. That means she doesn't have to worry about jobs for Janis-Dorothy. She just can't tell if it's because she's afraid of the job, because she knows she's too old to be a baby-sitter. (It makes Janis-Dorothy, who could be four and five, look younger.) But then Janis-Dorothy's mom had to take care of the rest of the baby. Her phone goes off when she thinks it's calling her, and Janis-Dorothy can't hold it. At least not in good health conditions.

Now Janis-Dorothy wants to be a
