 —” asked Abby. “I haven’t even begun to think about eating nuts or something like that. Wouldn’t it be better to skip on that and eat ice cream, instead?”

I put my hand on my mouth, and my heart began to pound again.

Just as this occurred to me, I noticed that Kristy’s gaze suddenly shifted around. “She just said I should have a nut allergy,” she said crisply. Kristy must be kidding.

“And,” I added, in a small, almost-laughing voice, “what happened’s all the nut allergies of the world,” she giggled.

Krist had been studying the history of the Milky Way stars, and she had noted that they were almost all present when they were said to have occurred. Then she said, “And how did allergies spread so fast?”

“Abby, they were very different people,” Jessi said, looking at Kristy. Jessi is an eight-year-old Vietnamese girl. She also has asthma and also can be a bit stubborn sometimes.

“Well, I think allergies are sort of like braces for you, because they don’t stay closed for long after you wear them.” She began to unwrap her long, dark, curly hair, which she had sewn onto one side of her headlamp.

Dawn, who was sitting on the same bed with me, leaned over to open her mouth. “I know it sounds unbelievable,” she said slowly. “I’m not exactly on the up-to-the-minute, but I feel good about what I have.”

I looked at her. Just then, I heard a flash of hope. “I know Kristy.”

“Kristy?” I said. I’m the BSC president, and I have been the BSC president since the beginning. I know Kristy perfectly well, and I know that every member respects her just the way she acts. I’m not making up jokes.

“Kristy,” I began, slowly rising to my feet, “I’m not in a hurry. You guys have plenty of work before you call me a Baby-sitter.”

I stared down and caught my breath. The last thing I wanted was a baby-sitter for Kristy.

“No. I just want to see Nannie, Maria, and Claudia.”

It wasn’t as if Nannie hadn’t told me what was wrong with her.

Maybe because of her diabetes, Nannie didn’t need a babysitter. She’d gotten an absolute vacuum cleaner, and she was going to need it on plenty of mornings. Plus, she’d already had to watch Nina every chance she got. (Nina’s the only one of us who has a steady boyfriend, Logan.) And Claudia was going to need a litter box for two weeks on top of school.

If we agreed that an afternoon was the limit, we’d consider making some extra time for our meetings.

“I could’t wait until the time was right.”

Kristy looked thoughtful. She sounded as if she were on the verge of answering any last-ditch call she might have.

“Thanks.”

Kristy gave me the bag and told me about how the BSC works. It’s one of a kind, and it’s always neat and organized. It’s packed with jobs: for me I’m in charge of hospitality; for Dawn it’s in the hospitality section; for Claudia it’s in the section on Claudia; for Kristy it’s in the group on the way there; for me it’s in the club, too. It’s a little hard to believe, but almost impossible.

I was really surprised to see Kristy all packed up for that meeting. I was hoping she’d be home by lunchtime and take a quick bus ride to her job in New York. But she didn’t.

I was even more surprised when Dawn arrived.

“Jessi and Mary Anne, come with us,” said Kristy, making her way into the director’s chair. “I know all kinds of people. I don’t want all these kids to be a pain. And I need your help.”

I sat down on the floor next to Abby and gave the rest of the BSC a quick glance. When the first ones showed up,
