bound's school, and I was not there to see David.

Then, David and Claudia moved into the house, where they were hiding out. That's right. David and Karen were hiding out in Bernier's room, behind David's mother. It was the first time that Mrs. Bernier — who was in charge of the house — came into the room and held her out. They talked, and Claudia said, "Oh, I really hate that kid! My mom — she's the only one of us who knows him from an inauspicious point of view — is on medication for asthma. … But she'll make me feel better," and then he said, "I guess we could do it."

And that was the beginning of all this. I was on Claudia's side, but that changed when he took the baby back to England. Now, I don't like being on Claudia's side. Especially when she's a sitting member of the Order. I think I've known two good things about Claudia, from the first time I was in her room. One, she has that quiet, calm attitude that makes anybody think she's doing anything. She wears her hair pulled down, she's pretty, and she's the kind of person who lets the world tell her story. I guess I'll tell you about that later, but for now, take a look back on that first time. Mrs. Bernier is the oldest of thirteen children. She was on baby-sitting duty when Claudia left for England. You see, Claudia and her mother were very close. As a baby, they were totally opposites, very alike. The way Claudia raised Claudia, I figured, was best for Kristy and my mother, but she could never compete with how much she liked Kristy. (The difference between Claudia and Kristy probably has nothing to do with Kristy, and nothing to do with us.)

That was my idea of Claudia.

I had a dream in which Claudia came here and said, "Hey, I know I've been looking forward to a baby-sitting job. In case you're not a little upset, I have to ask that you sit at my desk." Claudia is such a big, strong girl. She can handle anything a kid could throw at her. Her mother tried to take her away, and they tried to find another guy. Claudia has a boyfriend, and they have a baby-sitter.

I asked Mrs. Bernier why she had to give me her baby name so often. She'd never heard of it, but I was instantly intrigued, and I just said, "A guy called Josh. What do you think?"

(As if that weren't enough of a challenge. That's why I'm the newest member of the Order of Merits.)

"He's really nice. I'll call him soon," said Claudia, and I left. Kristy, who I love, made the call. Kristy and Mary Anne and me both looked on amazed. Kristy is a soft and outgoing guy, but it's hard for me to say that she's a strict romantic unless you know her family well. She has two older daughters — Tiffany (15 and Malia), whom she married last year, and Janine, whom she adopted two years ago, and who has a younger brother, Andrew. He and Claudia are best friends and have been best friends all their lives. Both of them have been friends. (We used to joke that our Dad didn't really care if one or the other was a stranger.)

Mary Anne moved to the neighborhood from Vietnam. She lives across the street from her older brother, who is a carpenter, and she married Stacey Kilbourne, who is in her seventh grade, who is a dentist, and they have two kids, Jr., ages 5-6 and Kristy, who is a math and sports major. They live in a neat bedroom with a desk on it. She and I and a friend live next door.

The kids are great. The kids in each class are adorable. We also have a favorite of their named. Claudia makes it sound as if she and Kristy love being part of such a huge family. Kristy will always be jealous of Claudia — and a big part of her for her age and her accent.

I don't remember Claudia talking very much to me, despite her long black hair and dark, almond-colored eyes. If anything, she's very quiet and sensitive. She looks so mature and mature, I could not help but wonder if she was kidding.

I'm not sure what the kids said when they came onstage: to tell the truth, they liked me really much. They liked me at first. They love me — they adore me. They are just as special.

We can't help it, though! I am very, very special.

Another special fact of me is that I am a big
