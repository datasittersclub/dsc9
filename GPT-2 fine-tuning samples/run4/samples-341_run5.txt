, and he's not really known for his jokes.

“Duh, I don’t know what,” he said, looking at Kristy. He was really, really confused.

“Uh,” I said. “I have a special call at your house today.”

“Well, Kristy, I’m sorry about driving you and your family all the way from Stoneybrook to town. But I’ve got a feeling I had a lot of work to do that afternoon.”

“Uh-huh,” said Kristy, turning to Stacey on the porch.

“Well, it’s only a quarter mile back from here …” I said. “Any business?”

“Well …”

So it was a really slow start, Kristy. But it really paid off. It didn’t take much time for Mr. DeWitt to fill in.

“I just heard that there was some kind of something to those black leather gloves that were on here today,” I said excitedly, as if it were the first thing that came to my mind.

“Hmmm … maybe, I’ll stop by to check.” Kristy called out that line.

“Yikes, my friend.”

“I think you’re cute!” She said, pulling open the front door. “Now let me get into the car.”

She took off her pants and took a deep breath.

“What did you get?” I asked as Kristy led me into the cabin. “Tobacco? I mean, the way I dress is really important to my skin. I eat health food. … Maybe someday I'll wear it. I mean, … I hate to say it, but you know what? I think the smell of those leather-and-garlic-brown gloves is pretty cool.”

She ran her hands up her dark brown hair and into her seat. “What’s so cool? Can’t you tell? I’m such a big junk food addict, I can probably eat a whole lot of candy while you smoke out there.”

I gave her a quick glance, but she didn’t look up. “I don’t know about you,” she replied with a shrug. “But I mean, really, candy is really important to my skin.”

“I could eat it, Kristy,” I said, feeling very smug about how ridiculous that sounded. “I mean, really, candy is kind of cool.”

“The way I dress is really important to my skin too,” said Kristy quickly. She put her hands on her hips and leaned into her seat.

“It’s so cool, Kristy,” I said. “I can never again try to wear the same black leather-and-garlic-brown glove.”

Kristy had been looking at the car a million times, which is what makes her job so very cool. I was staring at the front wheels of her car, wondering if a regular-sized SUV (like my beloved, adorable, awesome, super-fanservice, The Show) would work.

“Yeah, probably,” said Dawn. “I mean, not too far, but not too far enough.”

“Maybe,” interrupted Kristy.

“Nope. I’m not worried about that, Kristy. You should see Claudia. She is great.”

“I'll look for you,” I called. Then I pulled the car over the curb and raced home.

“Claudia, this really is a great vacation,” I told her. “It’s just that the weather is getting really cold here in Stoneybrook right now. And you know, I just can’t do a lot of anything except drive to the movies, to buy my favorite new music, and to do baby-sitting.”

“You just have to drive at least four or five long carriageways to every town on earth,” said Kristy. “I mean, you can do lots of work. Plus, you know the city is kind of cool, and you can get tons of new work.”

I was not happy with her for asking that, because I felt she was teasing me too much.

“I’m not kidding,” said Kristy defensively,
