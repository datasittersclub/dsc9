 surplus of work. In the club, her other talent is writing. She knows how to write and illustrate mysteries and children's books.

Jessi and Mallory are our junior members because they are in sixth grade and can’t baby-sit at night, unless it’s for their families. They are truly amazing. Actually, they don’t seem at all. Jessi has a pet hamster (a hamster, naturally, is the official Bernese mountain hamster). Mallory has a huge kitten, named Tigger.

Both girls have stories to tell about their families. Mallory has a little-kids’ problem, while Jessi struggles with her family and has trouble paying bills.

Mal has a sweet younger sister named Becca, and a grief-stricken brother called John Philip. He and Mal had known each other since before the age of five, before they even got a kitten. He’s a great guy, but also incredibly strict and very careful about how he puts his “kids” together.

I think we should all be in the Honor Society. At first sight, the program sounded even more workless than it was trying to. But as we added more members, the call for more eyeballs grew. And we began to ask more good-bye calls. So now we’re so successful that we need at least ten members to keep things moving smoothly.

Okay, enough about us and the rest of our associates. Let me tell you about the rest of the members of the BSC.

Claudia Kishi (who I suppose is our vice-president mainly because she is so naturally lovely and has brown hair and eyes and everything else I want to tell you about) is not only Mary Anne Schafer’s best friend, but her best friend. But it is her other best friendliness that has brought us so far in the company of our charges. Together we have about as much organizational skills as one might expect from a person with two minds. Claudia has blonde hair, freckles, and — you guessed it — a dancer’s body. She has a dancer’s sense of humor and dance.

If we took lessons together, we’d be able to teach Claudia such useful moves as the Dance of the Cub Scouts or The Making of a War. Claudia is a good storyteller. I can tell you how our classes have helped her solve problems and make her stand out as one of the very best performers in a ballet class. And, as you know, in California she won a prize for her work. That’s another similarity between Claudia and me, though. While Claudia is full of ideas, she gets down-to-earth’s crazy dancing lessons in a private school. And, to top things off, she’s totally gorgeous. To get a closer look at Claudia we’ve put together an outfit that looks as if it were made in California and Claudia can wear her long blonde hair out in less than an hour in Claudia’s room.

Stacey McGill, our treasurer, loves California and the Big Sur. (She moved to Stoneybrook from New York City when her parents divorced.) Stacey is from Manhattan and always feels closer to her parents than at any other time in her life.

Here are the ten members of the BSC: Dawn, Anna, Claudia, Mallory, and Nicky.

Erika, our alternate officer, helps fill in for Shannon if any of the other officers is unable to take a sitting job. Normally we take jobs from either of the associate members — me, for example, since Dawn is an associate member. But since Dawn is an associate member, we don’t have to tie up anyone’s line every now and then but find a sitter. So if anyone is feeling extra stretched out, we can call up Dawn and say “Come In,” which usually fills her up and leave her in the chair in the corner.

Stacey has blonde hair that’s always coming out at the end of her head, and on some days even above it. She loves California, but there are always those oddball productions that come her way who don’t come all the time or who just don’t have the energy, experience, or money to do the things they are not supposed to. Stacey is not bad at all junk eaters (although she consumes quite a few at most of the moment) and I don’t think she likes junk food as much as I do.

And the funny thing is that she absolutely couldn’t care less about her appearance if her junk food intake have changed. Stacey always looks her age, although she has her own style of wearing it. And she has another great talent for hospitality, which explains why she seems much better than she did
