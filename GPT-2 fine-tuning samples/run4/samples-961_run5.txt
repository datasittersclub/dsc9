 his job, and then Abby took over our middle school year.

But somehow, I could not move on from Stacey, or even worry about it. I had to go into that year in seventh grade. (By the way, I was the BSC's alternate officer during that time.) You see, when I’d just finished seventh grade, and when I was finished taking Dawn’s position, Stacey came to the same conclusion as I’d done before: that Stoneybrook was hopelessly on the wrong foot. She came to Stoneybrook because Stacey’s parents wanted to see her get a divorce, and her career had gone to hell. So Stacey went her own way. Stoneybrook got a real rundown by reading about the Big Apple in the newspapers, and by going to the movies there. Stacey’s parents got a divorce, and her mom decided to move into the old farmhouse she and her mom had been living in for years (that was built in 1795). What’s the Big Apple in Stoneybrook? I’m saving the truth for your first clue, Stacey might be a nut about that. I bet you’re right that the Europeans have lots of fun seeing this country that they love so much.

Anyway, Stacey’s mom married Watson Brewer, a decent guy, who just happens to have really blond, pretty-young (according to Watson) daughter and (according to me) very busy father who is in the midst of a very successful business. Anyway, Watson and Stacey were looking forward to a good time at the table, but when Dawn came home from work and said she’d rather be away, our hearts started going wild. How could any other parent be turned off?

So Stacey and I plotted ways to get Bart Taylor, Mary Anne Spier, and Stacey to join the club, ran out of work, and had to cancel one of their planned jobs. I’m the club notebook. We’re all busy writing about our clients, but there was nothing we could do without the other members. We’re always busy enough with other things, though, such as club business.

We also discuss what happened after the club members met. Some of our most recent posts have been extremely moving.

“How was your first job getting settled in here?” Jessi asks as she sits on the floorboard.

“Great. I’ll take it. Thanks, Mrs. Hall.” Her eyes fill with tears, and she pulls a sweater she’d bought for us from the box in her room. She’s a newcomer to Stoneybrook, but she’s making an impression and we like it.

“What a great idea, Jessi?” I say to Jessi, “Taking classes in Stoneybrook, I’m getting a seminary degree. I’m trying out these courses in order to get a good grade, so it’s a good idea, too.”

She looks at Jessi who takes them anyway. Then Jessi takes the Advanced Placement Math (also known as Calculus I or II) and Statistics class, getting an A’ to C average. At the end of her semester, she completes the same coursework and pass the math and science (whatever they’re doing together, anyway) twice. The rest of us take either Math or Science (depending on the branch), then Clunit. They do not take in-person classes.

Here’s how it works. Because Mrs. Schafer is a Stoneybrook resident, Jessi and her parents, who live there, earn a lot of money by going to Mal's house every other month. Their job is helping to clean up after Mal and Jessi, and Mr. Spier, and to Claudia. The members of the club are responsible for helping to keep the club running and organized, and to make sure all of us have a good time, and don’t have to spend any time trying out new things. (Which is not a bad thing, since we’re good at keeping organized and getting along with other club members.)

The club is very well organized, but not as advanced as the way my parents sometimes complain about Tuesdays. It’s one of the reasons I like Mondays so much. I can handle Fridays and Saturdays, which is just what my parents need. But Jessi and Mal have different ideas about what a nice Tuesday can be, and they do take some sitting jobs during busy times — which is how we run the club. All right. Just sitters.

At the beginning of the meeting we talked about one of our favorite clients, Watson. Then Watson suggested we ask Jessi how she got to be the
