ite is just the thing for both of them to stay in touch. “I think she wants to go back to New York and spend some time with her dad,” she said with a smile. “We have a few months to ourselves.”

“That’s an ideal vacation for you,” Mary Anne said.

“You do have a little money in your account,” I said. “You can pay us a visit later on.”

“I’m sorry,” Mary Anne explained, after paying my bill a few moments later. “We need a ride home from work.”

Mary Anne and I dropped the charges into the car. I handed Mary Anne Mary’s money. “Why don’t you … I could give you something to eat with your meal time … and I’ll check the registers and find out who the girl is. Then you know what we have to cook for you.”

“You’re lucky I’m all right,” I said. “I am pretty stubborn. You know, the kind of baby-sitter that I am.”

“No!” cried Mary Anne.

“How?” asked my friend. “You’re lucky you’re a baby-sitter.”

“Well, I haven’t been in a while but I have a few ideas for keeping you fed. One of them is a little snack bar. Why don’t you put them all over the place, I’ve told you how I do it. It sounds like a chore,” added Mary Anne, “but it’s … great. You can go to the movies, you know?”

That was it. Next came putting the plates together. Making sure that the lid was turned up, and that Claud had her hands flat on the work, and not touching the table at all. If she didn’t go to the movies, one of the plates would stay closed. Sometimes the back of the book says BSC, and the back of the front of the book says I guess.

The back of the book was covered with pictures of animals and people and all that stuff.

“How about a sign so you know what you can and can’t eat,” I said. “It’s a great idea. But it would be hard to find in our collection, that’s all. So we had to make a big one.”

“You’d like the idea,” said Mary Anne, our great, great friend, “but why not just sign it? What a funny way to tell you all.”

“Well, one of the plates would show us what to eat,” said Claud. “We can’t eat all of that stuff!”

That convinced Mary Anne to put the other plates on display. That might be a good suggestion.

I gave Mary Anne the sign and sent it … but I wanted to know if she thought some of the signs were ugly. Then I told her what kind of an artist sign was I might ask her. I wrote a note behind the photo of the sign.

Then I thought of all the baby-sitting jobs I have tried, including some that were advertised so well I thought I might as well advertise them.

“Do you know what job agency Claud’s looking for?” I said.

“Yes. I think I may be able to help you!” asked Claud. I hoped she would take the job.

“You are the perfect person for us, Claud, even though we’ve been getting lots of work,” she told her.

I nodded. I knew she still thought I was great.

“It’s just an idea,” said Mary Anne. “But I know something that is —”

“I know,” said Mary Anne. “It’s just the idea. What I mean by the idea?”

I nodded. “You have to be very specific about what you want to do. You have to try out all these different ideas.”

“So you’ll decide for yourself!” asked Mary Anne, putting her on my good side.

“Just think, Claud. What kind of baby-sitter would you be? That’s what I am looking for — an idea.”

“I’ll do it!” said Mary Anne, hopping up and down
