 course as she is always involved with kids and has never made a mistake — including one in the notebook, when Kristy had an allergic reaction to the coloring.)

Kristy and I met as a special kids club in high school. One day, when Kristy and I were still close friends, Kristy's older brother, David Michael, was acting strange and strange all the time. This wasn't unusual at all, although suddenly David Michael had seemed more like a regular baby-sitting family. For a while he and Kristy were even joining forces to form the Baby-sitters Club, which was basically a baby-sitting business. You see, David Michael was involved with this crazy new kid group called the We ♥ Kids, which consisted of Kristy, her younger brother, and baby brother, Shawna, who were all thirteen and in seventh grade at the time. They played games, did funny things, and had so many kids they hadn't even put a dollar toward any campaign yet. (They had to have dues cut or else they wouldn’t have kept the money. Plus, the We ♥ Kids needed more members, so the We ♥ Kids offered them a sitter for each job. They got jobs at their local stores or supermarkets.)

Then one particular afternoon, Kristy had come home from her babysitting job and found out that her mother, Sharon, had been the one who told Dawn and Dawn’s younger brother, Jeff, to stay over. (Did you hear what I said about babysitters? They’re the people who help kids who’ve been sick or badly behaved? They help people who have to baby-sit for their own siblings.) So when Kristy finally convinced Dawn and me that we should join the club, I picked up the phone and called right away to arrange for Dawn to sit for her own sitting charges.

When Dawn and Jeff were finished arranging, Dawn moved to California, and Kristy joined us, sort of permanently. Jeff stayed in California, then moved away, and so on. Dawn, by the way, is finally back in California, but the BSC has not been reuniting the regular members (in some ways, at least). The one person who always gets to be the steady face of the club is Stacey. Since we meet in her room, and we meet at her house, she has to come to meetings regularly to be in the cross hairs of the club. But she does it anyway.

The last two members of the BSC are younger than the rest of us. They’re our alternate officers, which means they can take over any job we have to give their permission. And since there are so many jobs, they mostly take older kids (the BSC has two associate members, who each come to meetings more often than the others). Sometimes, once a week they have to be at the meeting together. And they’re allowed to break in on the show or movie at their own rates, so long as they don’t go on too much.

So those are my friends. But I really am the best of friends. I could have lived with a best friend. One could have assuredly found a good one. Besides, my parents have decided to get a divorce, so I’ll have plenty of time to adjust to my new life. Besides, I’ve known Stacey forever, so she’s pretty much the opposite of Mary Anne. In case you haven’t figured it out, when an eleven-year-old eighth-grader (she has curly blonde hair, for one thing) turns twelve she becomes the first one of us to, um, get a divorce. She did it with a BSC job, and she didn’t even get to start school until the last few weeks of the year. (All our classes are in the fall.) Anyway, this was how it always ended for Mary Anne: for one night she felt as if she were losing a parent, and then suddenly the other one was very, very close to her. How could she let go of him? She pulled back the blanket that covered her brother and father and cried, tears streaming down her face. Then she turned to me and this whole family, and I must have felt the same thing: this is not the end of the world.

How would I know that? Because I’d seen it coming. Mary Anne and Stacey’s father and brother had almost literally died the minute Stacey and Dawn reconciled. Somehow, I thought, the Thomases had managed to survive on only part of what Stacey’s mother had bought them. Then, not long ago, Stacey’s parents adopted a little girl from Vietnam. Her name is Emily Michelle, and she has legs; she’s a very bright baby. Plus, she has clear blue eyes and curly, dark brown skin
