======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 she is, or maybe she is … still being raised by an adopted Vietnamese girl named Emily Michelle.

Abby moved into the house my family had been living in when Jessi first moved here. Abby doesn't usually come to meetings, but she and Jessi are very close. Even though Dawn is an infant, Jessi and Abby have very different lives right now. We've decided to call them "alternative artists." Abby wants to be an "illustrator of children's books." She's already won a prize for her artwork.

Since Jessi and Abby are eleven and in the sixth grade, their day off isn't mandatory at our meetings. But Jessi, who's African American and who lives in Kristy's neighborhood, has learned to take a break from things. (Her hair is always pulled into a beautiful jet-black cascade, in line with the colors of her eye, overcast day. Her eyes are so full of energy that she'd rather be studying ballet than reading a book.)

Jessi and her twin sister, Becca, grew up on Long Island and only moved to Stoneybrook when their mom married Watson Brewer, a real whiz at telling them about their family situation. Jessi and her mom had come to Stoneybrook for summer vacation and were soon adopted by their dad.

Since then, Mary Anne has been coming back to Stoneybrook, but she did become a naturalized U.S. citizen and had to leave the country before her second birthday, and her brother, David Michael, who had become an only child shortly after David Michael was born in Massachusetts.

Then there was this news: that Dawn had died. It sounded like a big reason for her leaving — something that was still too painful.<|endoftext|>
"How's everyone?," I said, reaching for my digital clock, "and I think Mom and Dad are going to ask David Michael if he's feeling really weird?"

"I'm fine, Mom," said Karen. "I just hate when anyone says that about us."

I nodded. "They'll want to find out what's bothering Kristy, too."

"They'll ask you some questions," said Claudia, who was sitting next to us. "Can you fill us in on what?"

"Kristy is feeling really weird, Claudia," I explained. I'd seen Claudia's expression on the night she said her mother was feeling really down, and she seemed to have a secret lover, which probably explains why she's the Queen of Silly Put-Downs.

There was a pause. Then the clock said 5:35. "Anna," I said, pulling the phone from my pocket. "Hello, Baby-sitters Club? Is something wrong?"

"What kind of a job?" called Karen.

"I'll check to see if we're in the club, but as my phone's so busy right now, I have to ask my parents to let me call my sister, Mary Anne."

We listened as Karen called my number. Then she said, "Okay, I'll call Mrs. Rodowsky back at five-thirty on the dot next." She hung up the phone, turned to Mary Anne, and said, "That'll take five minutes."

"She'll let you call when you're home." Mary Anne hung up the phone and looked at me. She took the lock off of the clock, put it down, and said, "Everyone in here — lock, please."

Then we dialed one more time.

"Next Monday, when Kristy's at the hospital?" said an urgent voice, which I could tell was Mary Anne's mother.

"Next Monday, when Kristy's home?" I said.

"Yes?" said Kristy, who has two older brothers in high school, Sam and Todd, who live at the community college. "I will. My sister's home."

I nodded.

"Then, I'll tell Mom, Claud."

"Great," said Kristy. "Now begin your visit with Mary Anne. You'll need all the time Mary Anne and Shannon." "They're only going to five on Mondays," I added, pointing to a day on which the barn is open to the public. "I know there are lots of people out there, but I think it's going to take some time for them to settle in."

"Mary Anne's house is usually cashed in," said Claudia. "Plus, she also used to live at the Rodowskys' house. She has some money in the bank."

"Thanks," said Mary Anne. "I wonder what the big deal is."

"I know it's just five a week," I said, "but don't tell. It's just something I figured out last week."

"What did you
