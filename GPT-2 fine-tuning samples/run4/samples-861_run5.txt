 one said “Mary Anne Spier?”

“Yeah?” I said. “I don’t know what she does. She sounds like a high school sweetheart.”

“I know. And I wonder when she plans to come to this one. She’s really down to earth.”

“Yeah!” Jeff’s grin faded into a smile. We stopped talking about Mary Anne and Dawn. As soon as I finished speaking about relaxing, Sam told me to count to five, then continued on. “There’s another one!” he said to the club’s clock, making a face. As he hung up the phone, I turned to the clock and saw that it was five-thirty. It was 5:29pm on a Friday, and most of us had left Dawn’s bedroom just as the clock turned to five-thirty.

So, that’s our Friday schedule. The seven of us raced off the bus and into the waiting room. We waited, hoping the waitress would give us a quick hello and an appointment with Claudia and Stacey. Unfortunately, she hung up the phone in the process.

“Hello, Claudia, 228-232-6419 —” she spoke briskly but firmly. She opened the door of the waiting room and sat on Claudia’s bed waiting for us.

It’s true. Claudia is our vice-president. She usually resets at the end of the month, to give the best part of her birthday to Stacey.

But what did the bellman say? I’d never seen such a neat, balanced figure before. On her back was a pile of tissues, in one arm were strawberries, the other arm were clove-thewed bananas.

I had seen this beautiful thing covered in carvings and in bright orange colored pencil case. You couldn’t tell it was this great for art. But in Claud’s case, it looked better. It looked even better when taken in relation to other art subjects. For example, do you notice the contrast between the pigtails?'s length at their tips? It isn’t that long, it just looks great on them. Not only is Claud beautiful, but she has this really great brain, something no other artist has, and she’s good at all subjects.

How did Claud come to be so good at math? Well, she was watching another art class and just had to put together some numbers. She was making a zillion numbers and was then repeating the same ones over and over. She was amazed at just how creative she was.

Claudia’s parents are strict. They forbid junk food. They also forbid all contact with the sun. So Claudia has to dress in things: jeans, a turtleneck, and running shoes (it’s not allowed on her, but Claud insists on it, even though it’s uncomfortable (and takes more willpower than Stacey and me to resist), so Claudia keeps a lot of things a zooey), and — worst of all — activity trackers: Yodels, gum-sorting books, and so on. She writes everything down in her room and hides it with her friends. The club headquarters is in her room, too.

She’s also our secretary. Her main duty is the supply of baby-sitters for the club. She keeps track of our clients and is in charge of the record book. (There are seven of us, three in all of us!) Each of us has a title and duties. We don’t make each other sign up for what used to be a handful of regular meeting times. She writes about our clients’ problems in the official BSC notebook and that day she was answering the phone at Franklin Building. We would have plenty of baby-sitting jobs in the future.

We would hardly have room for Claud and Stacey, though. We could afford to let Dawn and Shannon use our space.

Stacey was sitting next to Mary Anne Spier. You should see her — she looks … great. She’s short, like Stacey, and have brown hair and brown eyes. She dresses in a different way compared to Stacey, but the similarities are brief. For one thing, Stacey is an only child. She grew up with an only child, her great-aunt, and two other only-siblings (David Michael’s three brothers go to Stoneybrook Middle School, while Sam and Charlie’s only parent comes from Long Island, which is near the city). Then too, Stacey’s parents got divorced and Mrs. Spier decided to move back to New York City.

Stacey was on great terms with
