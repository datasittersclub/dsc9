�’s in charge, but they don’t always have the time to do all that.

That’s because our charges go out of their way to look for jobs. For example, Dawn can’t eat junk food, but sometimes she sits on Claudia’s lap and watches Margo’s homework, and Kristy takes care of the rest. But there will be times on holidays when the rest of the charges will be there. So on a regular basis Dawn and Marylia work hard to find sitting jobs. Marylia, by the way, happens to be vice-president (because our club was a part-time business after all), so she keeps track of everyone’s schedule.

Marylia is our associate member, which means she gets to sit for anyone who’s free. I think it’s great for Marylia to have a reliable friend who can take over her job — that’s why she’s our first associate, after me. We refer to the position by that name because Marylia helps us out a lot when we have too many friends around, but we all know how to get things done.

Okay, now you’ve seen the girls.

“Oh, hi,” I said. “Can I help you today?”

“Sure, thank you,” I replied. “I could use some rest.”

As I turned to leave, I saw Jessi and Dawn sitting in the director’s chair, while Emily Michelle, Kristy, Stacey McGill, and Shannon “sat in Claudia’s director’s chair.

“Good.”

“Good.”

I started off in my usual place. I sat down on the director’s side of the couch, letting Jessi, Stacey, and I handle business.

“Hi, everybody.”

Mary Anne and I both started the meeting in my usual place, but on this day, I wanted everyone to know that it was a special day.

As the clock turned from 5:30 to 6:00, I announced the meeting.

“Hello.” (That was Jessi Thomas, our club’s vice-president.)

I grabbed a bag of Oreos off the ground in my left pocket, ran up to Jessi, and sat down.

“Jessi … I know … you are busy … but there are two new girls at school. Let's begin.”

Jessi turned to me and said, “Hi, do you care what I think of you?”

“Me?” I asked.

Her face fell.

“Jessi?”

I looked. Jessi is the oldest girl in my eighth grade class. Her parents are divorced, but she’s had a pretty decent life since birth. For a long time, she stayed with the Spierans. Then, when Dad suddenly moved back to Stoneybrook, she’d married his ex-wife, Sharon.

Then, this summer, Sharon left.

The Spiers have lots in common — Jessi’s being an only child, Mary Anne growing up, and a pretty strict, worldly family. They have two older sons, Sam and David Michael. And they both adore reading.

I was surprised that Mary Anne hadn’t taken over their house. She had, too.

Mrs. Barrett grew up in a small house on Burnt Hill Road in Newerland Park. (We call Mrs. Spierland homesick.) Mary Anne is not crazy about that. She doesn’t even like her parents. She just wants to be organized, independent, cool, etc. She doesn’t care that Mrs. Spier is divorced, which is what she used to be. Plus she likes to be a responsible parent. She’d like her parents to return to their previous lives, where she did what was right. She also wants to spend her time together with Mary Anne.

Here’s how it works. When you reach Dawn and me, we begin taking her phone calls. Then, after we have talked a little (and the phone is quiet for a while), we decide whether to baby-sit (we do sit). That way, Dawn knows how excited she is when someone calls. We then tie up her lines to wait for someone else.

Then we tie up the phone — and then the whole line gets shut down. We have to wait a few more minutes to find someone who will call. That’s a big problem when you’re dealing with more than one number. You don’t want to make the phone
