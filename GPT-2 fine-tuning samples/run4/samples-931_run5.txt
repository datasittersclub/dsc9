 after sitting still all day, but she was a BSC member too. That day she’d been idly watching a sketch with the words “This Is How We Make It.” I couldn’t help giggling. “Oops.” She was giving me a quizzical look, then she said, “This isn’t how we make it. It’s almost too goofy.”

I was almost as excited as she was, but the BSC was calling to order. There was no prize money involved.

“What is it?” Claudia asked casually.

“A meeting of the We ♥ Kids Club, Kristy Thomas and the new Baby-sitters Club, this afternoon.”

“Okay,” Kristy replied. “Any new business?”

We were excited, but we weren’t quite sure what to make of Kristy. As Baby-sitters Club president between meetings you’d expect her to be at every meeting. Usually, she lets things run in her direction, which is a nice way of dealing with new problems. But lately, she’s been a little more bossy than usual.

“What is it, Mary Anne?” Kristy asked, before lifting her up from the carpet. “A meeting of the We ♥ Kids Club.”

Mary Anne peered over her shoulder with a puzzled look on her face. Then, as if it weren’t weird enough, she leaned back in the director’s chair and announced, “This meeting of the We ♥ Kids Club will be over soon.”

“What?” I’d honestly thought Kristy knew better than to ask.

Kristy was now holding up the We ♥ Kids Club record book, in which she once again had stashed her We ♥ Kids Club dues. Even I knew that the fact that Kristy had sat for me and the other baby-sitters the whole time seemed odd. I was the honorary member once again, a job which paid dues and which Kristy generously gave me. And once again, I was the honorary member, so no one noticed.

It wasn’t that I wasn’t excited about the We ♥ Kids Club. It was that all these other Baby-sitters had come to our meeting to see what was happening.

I think I forgot to mention that the We ♥ Kids Club is really cool. I think the name is sort of like a universal name: We ♥ Kids Club. It means baby-sitting for kids you never have to see in a real pinch. Who’s Who, what they’re reading, how they dress, what’s happened in the house they’re living in. It was like … oh my gosh! This was cool.

I took a deep breath and pulled the club notebook from my pocket. As I lay there on the floor, I felt very, very cool. And — and not only because of how I dressed — I felt like I belonged.<|endoftext|>
By five-thirty, when it was time for our Monday BSC meeting, I just knew Mary Anne would have moved over. I knew Mary Anne already — in fact, right away — had decided she was happier living in Stoneybrook (or maybe somewhere else entirely). And Mary Anne and I have been friends since before we started the BSC.

You see, Mary Anne and I grew up near the beach, right on the Mexican border. We didn’t go there for nothing. We went to Stoneybrook Day School (where we both live) in pairs: Mary Anne and her first love, Lacey McGill. When we first met each other, we didn’t even know each other at first. But once we became friends, we became friends again, and we’re close friends now.

We even get along really well, even if we are only friends at times. Mary Anne and I are the only pairs who really get together each other, and we go toe-to-toe in person — just like Dawn and me — are not impossible. (Our parents don’t allow us to baby-sit at night, unless we’re at our own houses, which we don’t do much.)

“Let me think about a couple of nicknames for you guys later,” I announced, now that Stacey had closed my door.

“Hey!” the others replied. “Mary Anne, you!” Mary Anne, who was dressed as a pirate, was wearing an old black and white striped skirt, short stockings, and blue jeans with red, yellow, and green lightning
