 take. Our club dues are just for the food, though. (I'm the vice president, so that means I have to take those jobs with a large group of regulars.) We also cover Charlie Thomas's personal phone bill, since we use the club dues for two things — a club notebook filled with information we can use to sort through the club files, and a fund-raiser for Karen and Andrew, who help families with sitting problems.

As I mentioned, we also have some new business. Kristy has a musical talent we don't usually have a talent for. She studies to become a publican, and she really takes lessons at Bradford Middle School in nearby Stamford, which is the official school in Stoneybrook.

Just as her family is growing, so Kristy's family is growing. She has two older brothers, Charlie and Sam, plus one younger brother, David Michael. Her older brothers, David Michael and Tim, are genius kids, academically at least. Kristy's family grew up in Stoneybrook, but she hardly ever talks about them.

You'd never guess Kristy lived on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, which is on the edge of town, with her legs lettered in a cowboy hat and black slipper hat. That day, she was perched on top of a tree, waving her hands with both of her apron pliers.

"Hi, Dawn," she said, pointing to the branch that led from Claudia’s bed to the desk. Now I’m sure she was proud of herself. At the very least, she was excited about the coming days and weeks, mainly because she loves kids. Plus, she’s a good student, and I’ve seen her do great tests. (She’s very precocious.)

While we were talking about the tests, Dawn called Kristy down the hall, wanting to talk about Waldenstadner. Usually when her calls come in she’s pretty preoccupied with the homework, but this wasn’t the case with this particular subject. This was a really interesting subject for Kristy, and the best thing about it — we got lots of good work. It really helps keep our club on track.

"I hear there is a meeting of the Young Peasants’ Children’s Club coming up soon," said Claudia, rolling her eyes at Kristy. "I know Mary Anne would like to sit as a child. And Abby, too."

Abby Stevenson is our newest member, and she’s Abby Newton. We met her at the beginning of the year, when Mary Anne and Kristy, our associates, started asking Abby out around town. Abby is really friendly and easy to talk to, and she loves to sew and paint. Abby is also talented, having made a best-selling children’s book out of her. She loves books like Slumber Party and I’m Not Having That On. She loves to write and draw, and she still loves her three brothers, Charlie, who is fifteen, Sam, who’s fifteen, and Todd, who’s twenty-seven. She even bought this cute leopard print leotard, which she wears with her black short sleeve drawers. (She lives with me.) Abby is the most talented I have ever met.

One thing I’d like to have more of is the stereo. My room is cluttered with boxes that I listen to only when I have a phone call or two in between appointments. But I also have two mono ears (so do all my brothers and sisters, whether they have digital ears or not). Sometimes I wind up buying three or four set of identical earrings, on which my stereo pairs out with the ones my digital ears.

My stereo picture would show a boy in my class at SMS, with his arms folded toward me as if I were standing in their way. The pictures would show a boy with his ears spread open, leaning against the wall, looking like he was in a movie with a girl. In those pictures, I’d be sitting across from Claudia, wearing the boy’s clothes only, with my picture painted on my earrings. But with an invitation to dance with him, I went with his picture and with the guy I was sitting with, and he looked really hot at 70 degrees.

Anyway, in those pictures — and in my picture, too — I would be sitting cross-legged on the floor, wearing my boyish hat and glasses, and the girl in the picture sitting with his arms outstretched, my knees bent even, her feet bent backward. Maybe you’d like to hear my opinion about the fashion that is dressing up Halloween in my room! (Well, maybe not the mall.) I don’t think my picture would show you a trend that’s new to the landscape, unless you
