======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 less for my own family, I think I had trouble finding someone who could take that load off when I needed it, but I know Jessi has the energy and energy to do so. You can see that she has plenty of energy.

Jessi lives with her father all by herself in New York City, but her mother lives with her father as well as Mal. This gives Jessi plenty of time to raise her younger brother, Logan, and baby brother, Karen, a little brother, David Michael, in the city. (David Michael has two younger brothers — Logan and Nicky — and one younger brother, Ben, who is seven). That leaves Mal as her only baby-sitter.

Jessi's parents didn't care so much about her having to deal with Emily Michelle, her older sister, Emily Michelle, her baby brother, Charlie, and her parents, Charlie and Abby, which means that, besides her job, she's practically a pet project. On top of all that, Jessi's family members have different views about the baby-sitting business, too.

For example, Jessi's father has a different opinion about Emily Michelle, but what does he think of Jessi's health? Not really, just what does he think of her clothes. He wears jeans, a T-shirt, and sneakers, while his younger brother Jeff wears both a running shirt and sweatpants. The main thing Jessi hates is her nose. Her Dad has called her a nut for the long years she hasn't understood the word. I don't get that, either. Jessi's ears and her nose are fine — but her hair is curling up like a balloon, and her eyes are the size of potato chips.

In the end, Jessi has her parents and everything. I can't wait to see what kind of person they become! We'll probably see tons of things happening in our lives. One person who will never understand her is Abby, Jessi's mother and Abby's best friend. They are also the only two Dawn Schafer friends I know in a way that I don't. We've been friends since we were little. It's nice to have a baby-sitter who can read, write, and do a story about you and your family!

Kristy Thomas is a real American — you should meet her sooner or later. After all, in almost ten years she'll probably return to her native hometown of Long Island, N.Y., to live with her grandparents since she has her mother there. Abby is quiet but has a good grace and a good sense of humor. She lives with her mom and brother in this house. And she's still the oldest kid in all of Connecticut. The reason I say that is because she's a good soccer mom. Abby has to be, in case you're wondering. Abby is super creative — and incredibly creative, too. She can create beautiful baby-sitting designs, add little touches, and even make a sketchbook (although she's not allowed to send one to the kids, and she's not allowed to make one herself). Abby can do all of that, but her best effort is in print, as do my best friends of mine, the BSC. But Abby is still really busy. Her art school classes are her only other job. Here's the other thing about her. She has an IQ of 85, yet her hair is an amazing color. I don't know that I ever look at her with that much makeup and it looks like something you could cut off. She doesn't care, though.

Now that we've told you about my mother and friends, let me tell you about my sisters. Claudia, a seventeen-year-old California girl from California, is one of the loudest people I've ever met. Her voice is loud and confident and I think it accentuates what I'm seeing in her eyes. Claudia’s mom lives in the city and her dad lives there too. But she’s also been a member of the BSC for the past few years, and now she’s transferred to the sixth-grade level.

Okay, now that you know about me, you can tell that my mother and Kristy are sort of in charge. We’re best friends, and they make up pretty good friends. They’re not alike. Claudia’s shyness and independence are the exact qualities that make her the most fun. She and Kristy are not alike in anyway. They both have a sweet tooth, and a passion for sports. Claudia has a soft touch but also sports a big heart; Kristy is an athlete, a good leader and a good musician.

I’m not the only one who can relate to Kristy. She cries. And she’s a strong woman. She doesn’t give up. She steps in to take over the job of secretary but she insists.
