 to help run the club. Mr. Kruslin was the one who had the perfect idea for changing our club to be better for the baby-sitting business. He thought it would take away the BSC from our parents and make one of us more available to baby-sit for other kids. He could find another secretary and would be able to let us take more jobs.

So what we have — nine new members and seven more clients — are a lot of things. The club has grown to be our biggest business. We now have a director, a secretary, two treasurer (Jamie says we spend almost all of our time in the club record book, because we have to keep track of all of our money), eight sitters (Kristy, Charlie, Logan, and me), and the chance to hire more baby-sitters. Plus, we now have an on-again, off-again associate member called Shannon.

We all take things seriously. We have good ideas for things we bring along on our rides to meetings. For example, I'd love to meet a new kid every Friday like Kristy and Charlie have, and then find a sitter who would be very popular for a sitting job.

I have two jobs. First, I'd like to work for another agency, so I could use this opportunity to audition for clients from time to time. A client already knows who I am, so I can call the person to see who is available (or not available) in the Wednesday sitting job. I don't think I'll ever have to audition again.

Claudia is our associate member. She's the person that we use on Saturday sitting jobs. She's easy, quiet, and a great listener with a sensitive way of speaking. Her mother died when Claudia was little, when her dad still went there, and when she was a baby. But Claud is a very responsible person, and very caring. (I mean, all nice people — very caring.)

Claudia is very sensitive. She even has a little bit of allergies. In fact, she and Claudia are opposites in several ways. They both have very different personalities, which makes for a hard-ass personality. But I think it's her way of handling family problems that makes the difference between them so much more important.

Dawn Schafer is our honorary member, which means she doesn't attend meetings unless it's for study with a BSC member. So far, that's been helpful enough, since Dawn lives in a house shewn from the floor so the members can't all live there together. But Mary Anne, our associate, still lives in the same bedroom with her and her two brothers on the other side.

Finally, Claudia Kishi, our honorary member, lives far away and is a genius at math. I wouldn't want to live with a genius like that.

So there you have it! That day my friends. We didn't start a job ad, or even fill a form. It was like sitting for an old boyfriend waiting for the phone to ring to ring. I don't know how Claudia has ever managed to remember to tell anyone else she's a genius and we don't need to, let alone their mother or dad or anyone else.

It's another member job, another challenge in her life. As the associate secretary, that job still counts as the most important one. When she takes over, we'll be on her toes.

Dawn is the only one of us who has a great idea, so she sits in the director's chair and checks the schedule. “I should see Mary Anne. She’s always at the BSC meetings. Just kidding …”

I can see her thinking about Mary Anne and the other sitters at her place. Mary Anne is the first one of us to take her to see her in person. She’s also Mary Anne’s best friend, and an absolute must see. As secretary, Mary Anne has the responsibility of telling all sitting jobs to baby-sitters. “How many people can we recruit?” she asks me. “That will depend on the business.”

Mary Anne is so good with kids that she’s practically the BSC's newest kid. But lately she’s had a hard time adjusting to life with her brothers, her father, and Jessi. And while he’s been through a lot, Mary Anne is just getting used to him, and she and her mom are not about to let up. When she talks, it’s with the same energy and intensity that made her so special.

Mary Anne is a talented dancer. And while I have to admit that she is more talented than most of the other BSC members, she isn’t the only great student. For example, Jessi isn’t very good with either hand
