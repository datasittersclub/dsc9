 help, too. I could see myself working on the menus and making menu changes, but I was still going fast.<|endoftext|>
I think I'm doing the math, huh? Well, I guess not, you know? Actually, there are two ways to calculate the number of children in a row — counting by the hundred or counting by the thousand. The first thing you have to understand about a statistic is that it doesn’t tell you anything. It just tells you how many people are in a home at once, and how many people will be in a very, very short amount of time. Then it’s just as easy to do an easy math problem and still have a much better idea of the size of the group as you begin to solve it. The second way to understand how a statistic works is by putting it to good use.

Take a basic math problem. Suppose there are three people; two boys and one girl. Now suppose the two boys are in a car; the girl is sitting in the front seat. How would the three people fit in the car? Simple. One would be in the car alone, the other would be with Mrs. Johanssen; the girl would have to walk several hundred yards to Claudia’s house, and so on. But another three people would be sitting in Claudia’s doorway, which is where the girls are meeting. Why is that? Because Claudia and her husband like to be with them. They are the ones who decide when and how many people will be at the meeting. Why? Because they feel that, in case their sitter doesn’t find out immediately, she or he can call the family.

Here are some other things you should know about a statistic: how many children will a housemate be? What happens if there are two or more people in the same household? Can you tell by the numbers in a statistic that two people in a housework job will be in a hundred and thirty-seven different households?

You’d find the answers to all these questions in my notebook, The Math of Bat Mitzvahs. That’s all I wrote that afternoon. You’d not even have to look it up.

Actually, I’ve written an even more advanced essay on that subject. Here’s some background. For example, here is what happens when you look at the Jewish calendar: there is one on every Monday, a calendar of our Jewish holidays and of course the official beginning and end dates of our baby-sitting jobs.

On Mondays, there will be four official members: Kristy Thomas, Mary Anne Spier, Nannie, and me, Claudia Kishi, and Stacey McGill.

Here’s what happened at Kristy’s desk (the day before): Claudia opened a drawer and noticed a bag of Doritos, a candy bar, and two boxes of chocolate. She pointed to one of the boxes, which was containing an old CD-ROM, and a box of softcover art prints from the 1960s. She passed the art prints on to Mary Anne and Stacey, who took them on. Suddenly, Claudia thought, "What a treat — to see new prints. That’s a sign of good fortune." They got the prints and placed them in the art cabinets. When they returned them, Mary Anne and Kristy were sitting in the Claudia Kishis’ living room. And on the walls of the Kishis’ bedroom.

And on the floor of Mary Anne’s bedroom, Kristy was in a room with Kristy’s desk, because Kristy’s desk is her own bedroom, which is why she has a secret passage going from one bedroom to the other. I remember seeing her do that sort of thing in college.

But I was still surprised. Because we live across the street from Claudia. I hadn’t expected that.

Claudia, which means “daughter” in Hebrew, means “daughter to the Jewish people, or to the people of the country, if that’s right. I mean, the people of a Jewish country. No, this isn’t a joke. It’s not, actually — a joke. Here, this is the truth: we grew up here in the Big Apple. We call it the “New Europe.” That’s because the British colonial rule was strictly enforced there. In short, it was pretty strict. But it was mostly aimed at sending a shiver up the spine of a person’s spine.

The idea for the “New European” idea came to Kristy on a Friday afternoon, when her mother was still away the night before. Her father had decided it was best if her mother lived with her father the next weekend.
