 keep our clients feel welcome is because they meet in our room. Our clients know they can reach us at Claudia in our phone line, at (877) 590-7231, or on one of our personal voicemail lines.

Claudia, our brains, is the queen of the rich. As vice-president, it’s her job to supply all of our clients with great, healthy snacks and to give them the comfort of home with us. Claudia is also an artist. Today she painted a huge mural on the walls of our room, and on one wall she painted a wild haired kid with shiny red hair and dancing shoes. On the other wall, she painted a woman dressed in a tropical-looking costume. I think this was pretty wild for just about everyone, except Claudia. But Claudia’s not a tropical-honey-buddy type. A tropical-honey-buddy type is anybody who can’t make it to a meeting without working, or is just not comfortable with work.

Claudia is absolutely the cutest girl in our school. She’s the only African-American in the entire sixth grade. She has a mom and stepfather, two older brothers named Charlie and David Michael, a younger brother named David Michael, and a younger brother named Michael. Her grandmother, Nannie, is a jet-setter who lives with the BSC and goes to school with. When I think of Claudia’s dream,’the dream starts to seem distant. But Claudia’s mind is active and thinking. She’s always thinking of something cool and doing it. She even makes dream catcher devices, which she calls a crayon. I think someday Claudia would like to paint her own walls with her crayons — all in one!

Now to the junior officers. Mal and Jessi are eleven and in the sixth grade, while the rest of us are thirteen and in the eighth grade. (The rest of us are in the twelfth grade.) Their parents are divorced and their dad still lives in California. Their idea of entertainment is going to a movie with them and seeing all of them together. Jessi and Mal wear red, and their favorite pastimes are dancing and eating junk food. (They actually take some Tootsie Pops on their lunch.)

So it is a good thing junior officers haven’t figured out how to hold a meeting in their room in the morning and not be reached from the floor by Claud’s flashlight. Mal and Jessi use their locker on Thursdays, and their locker is on the second floor, next to the bed, where they hide their cell phones and their cellphones are always turned on.

One problem. Other than that. No one is allowed to get their ears pierced, except their mothers, and no one does except ask Claud if he can keep hers opened, or even put a visor to one ear and wear a wire to the other. It’s kind of a pain getting pierced in the ear, especially on boys, but you always get the message, Mom, we’re not required to wear contacts, and I don’t. That, and Stacey and Claudia are not allowed to get their ears pierced. I guess they are just not interested. Besides, you know what? They have pierced ears, right?”

The next thing we knew, the phone was ringing and the club was in the middle of a meeting. The meeting had gone nearly a minute late, and the three of us were rolling around on the floor, arms folded. Claudia was holding the receiver and was writing in her book, which was taking up more space than she could handle.

“Heyyyyy, it’s Stacey!” she said. “Let me check the book and tell you when it’s ready.”

“All right and now!” I exclaimed. “We’ve got meetings in our system!”

“We’re in our system,” Claudia replied. “We’ve got a meeting.”

“Sure,” I replied. “Let me check.”

At the same time, the phone started ringing and the five of us laid back in our new position. Claudia was holding it up and pointing to something and putting her hand over the receiver. Then she started turning back and forth a little. “Boy,” she said, “it’s getting hard to keep up the keep up the keep up.”

I have to admit I didn’t see what was happening with the other girls in the club. What was I listening to? Well, I finally managed to talk one of the other girls to the truth — by listening to what Claudia was saying. But she sounded agitated
