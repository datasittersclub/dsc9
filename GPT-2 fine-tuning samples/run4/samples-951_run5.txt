 a lot of money. This was something she’d wanted to talk to me about for some time.

“Tell me about your business, Stacey.” I tapped out Archie.

“That’s all I have to say.” Stacey was already moving toward the front of my desk. “How did the sale go?”

“I have some interesting stuff in my tool box. My friend Claudia is in it. The thing is, I don’t think I’d been able to find it’ll bring it up all the time. You know, I have to start over. The tool box was one of my main ideas. It’s really important to me that people understand how the rich use tools and how the poor learn to use them effectively.”

“What are your ideas for getting around the tool box?” I asked.

Stacey nodded. “The museum, to make it more accessible to everybody. The Kid-Kits.”

I could feel myself blushing because I had been so busy with my job. “Great. I really like that.”

“Okay. So we’re going to do that.” She went back to her chair and I could see Archie and Mrs. Springer (owner of the BSC) were busy setting up booths for the kids. I was glad when they showed up for the job and also because I wanted them so badly. I hoped they would stick by me as I try to understand the business better.

“We do need a lot of help now,” I answered. “We’ve been working on those big files. We keep track of every little detail such as the color, size, shape, and content of the items in each kit, and of course, the money spent on advertising, on having a great time.”

“How about if a child or family member of a dead family member is feeling particularly awful and need help?”

I thought about all of them. Finally I said, “Well, uh, some of them are new to the BSC, but they’re terrific.”

“Okay. The kids can call us at their local hospital or practice. The adults can call us then to set up jobs.”

I nodded. I was eager to start the meeting with the children and with the activity. There was nothing I couldn’t do.

I imagined working on a map or creating a fancy poster for a local publishing company. Working on a neighborhood suddenly seemed like a natural fit.

I was psyched. I had just seen an art show. What a way to spend the evening. I couldn’t wait to shop at the thrift shops, or my school pajamas, or my phone bill, or my phone bill in the middle of a project at the office of a famous designer. I had a strong theory that the children would find the art show at the gallery exciting, and they’d be ready to fixated on it.

I stopped in the gallery just in time to see the murals on the walls. My heart sank.

My heart sank. I looked around the room and saw that there were children’s toys waiting for the BSC to introduce them. I picked up a box of Doritos last Wednesday afternoon and headed for my room. Nothing like catching a play group or a rainy day with a fun game. The children were there, and they were excited. I could see the members of the BSC in action. I always am when we do things our normal way. We sit and eat, and then we go on a boogie-the-ground way. That’s one reason we are so successful.

And why we are so successful. When the BSC was even a small part of our club, we were overwhelmed. Why weren’t we happy? Well, maybe that’s partly because of the many sitters we have now. Our clients are families where only one parent holds onto a job. We have seven members, five of whom are over 65 years old.

We also have two associate members of the BSC (those we can call on to help out) who don’t usually come to meetings. They’re people we can trust to our safety. They’re not official BSC members, but they help out whenever we’re too crowded. My friends and I used to be super-jealous of them. Now we’re glad our parents didn’t let us get our ears pierced, or our braces changed to show blood, or our glasses turned away from sun during school trips. We still want to be able to get contacts. But most of
