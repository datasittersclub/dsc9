======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 addict was also at Stoneybrook Middle School, and she wanted to become a health-food designer. But Jessi and I were too busy with the math problem to discuss it anymore. So, we decided to leave it at that.

In order to save extra time in the office, we all sat out there, except for Jessi and I, who were sitting on a bench next to the desk. I wanted to see Jessi's picture (where the puppy curled up behind her when she wasn't looking — her eyes were fixated on the puppy, not the dog!) and I wanted to see her picture as much as possible. We each sat on the first-grade bed and looked around as the rest of us sat. (Our school year ended on a bad note a few days ago.)

"How'd you like to go to the mall?" we asked each other, as if it were our next meeting.

We decided on a rainy day — a Monday, which isn't exactly a festival, but not too bad, since kids are not allowed to play in the warm weather. Not long after that, Stacey arrived. She pulled herself up on the bed and took a glance at the clock at our school. It was nine.

As soon as she opened her arms to Mrs. Ramsey, she turned her attention to Claudia.

"Hey, Stacey, are you ready to go?" he asked.

"That's a good one."

Claudia cleared her throat. "Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about? We talked to Kristy again, but she said you can go to the mall."

"Uh, yeah, I know I said!" Claudia smiled. "And I know it's just me and Stacey."

As the meeting continued, there was some more drama. Claudia and Stacey went their separate ways. Kristy spoke up and Stacey spoke up again, too. Kristy suggested that we just take a walk and find out what our neighbors think about Stoneybrook. Mary Anne said, "Well, I have two business ideas, if we can get Stacey there."

"You could try to find someplace else." Claud interrupted.

Mary Anne shrugged. "I haven't gotten a clue as to what Mary Anne and I are talking about, anyway."

"Maybe she'll let us have a snack tomorrow."

"I want a snack tomorrow." We all grumbled. Mary Anne said, "What if Mary Anne and I don't make this trip tomorrow night? We can do that."

"We've got a few choices, so we'll just have to sit for the day."

"If you're having a difficult time with us, don't worry about it." I said. I didn't want to make the mistake of rushing out like that. I meant it.

Mary Anne took her hands off the table and smiled at me. "Well, I'm going to have a snack tomorrow, so maybe I won't have to sit for the day." But I didn't want to let her go without a snack, so I said, "What if you don't make it to our meeting tomorrow, or I leave the car on the sidewalk and don't get to the mall? It's going to look great!"

Mary Anne blushed at the thought, but she didn't say anything because she was sitting on the same bench in the corner. She was leaning on the edge of my desk. And she didn't seem to mind her father being so overbearing.

"Okay, okay," Mary Anne said. "As long as you don't take the day to do things too early."

Stacey looked up from her watch and grinned. "I'll be out early, too. I'd be better if I didn't have to."

"But that's not about me right now." It was about her and my family that changed the day we returned to our old house.

My grandmother was always the first to come and take me to Stoneybrook Mall. Until then, Stacey was my best friend and I was the other.

"Stacey, did you know who my mom is?" I asked her. She said that her mom, Sharon, used to date one of my best friends, Jessica Ramsey, who is African-American, and she's always nice.

"You know who, Stacey, I do."

"Sharon?"

"No."

"And you know what? We go to this private school called Beavis and Butthead, and I go to one of our free events, Stoneybrook Day, and I meet the girls who go to school here."

"Oh, my."

"And I know they're wonderful, too, so I know they'll always be. I know them like a brother. We
