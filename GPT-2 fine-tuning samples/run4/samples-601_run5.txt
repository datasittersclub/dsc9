 a long train ride from New York City to St. Augustine, Florida.) This is only the first clue that Kristy isn’t shy when it comes to being a little girl. In fact, she’s the one I knew from kindergarten.

Kristy is outgoing, very quiet, and pretty tough on her. If the rest of us thought Kristy was shy, we would laugh. She doesn’t let herself get you anywhere. Kristy does talk a little, even if that’s just to tell us that you’re late or that one of your friends has a tough time dealing with it. Kristy’s got a good sense of humor and a great sense of body. It doesn’t matter if she’s very serious or very sentimental.

So that’s Kristy. See what we can tell you about her — or see what Kristy has to save her life?

I’ve known Kristy for a long time now because, well, she was her mother’s boyfriend while she was baby-sitting for Pete. So you’ve probably heard that my mom and Kristy’s dad (my mom’s father) were the original four friends of the BSC. I mean, the original four. We were the original four, right? Wrong. First of all, I think it doesn’t even take much to be part of a group of friends. Second, we were very, very much alike back then. And third, Kristy was the first one to have a boyfriend.

It didn’t take long for all of us to fall in love. Mary Anne was new for the group, and I was even with her after she turned thirteen. We all grew up together, and I just think of Kristy and her family as one big, happy family. The girls were Kristy’s three brothers — Charlie, Sam, and David Michael, that is. Now I’ve got two big boys, an eight-year-old girl named Karen, and two little ones named David Michael and David Michael plus Shannon, a puppy named Shannon (she’s Mary Anne’s boyfriend), and a baby, a cat, and two friends — plus a dog and two goldfish. And, of course, you’ve got Kristy’s Krushers Club, which is a club of girls who have to meet every other week to get ready to take jobs, and who’ll help out clients when they need sitters. What a club.

Okay, enough about me. Now let’s get back to Stacey McGill. She’s not a great student. She just has this unprofessional, unprofessional hair, and it’s really messed up. She’s the only girl in the club who’s even taken a job as a reserve sitter. I don’t blame her. It was her fault. But Stacey had better take care of her hair and her personality.

Okay, back to Claudia Kishi. That’s Stacey the Brewer. If I thought she couldn’t be more different, forget it. She is the Brewer’s junk food lover. She’s a total junk food addict. Claudia’s the most difficult girl in our meeting. She likes junk food as much as the rest of us. To her, it’s disgusting, just like it is to her. And she has to be super-strict about what she eats (and doesn’t even give a rat’s about that). That’s a lot of sugar in her system. Claudia’s a diabetic. When she eats certain foods, she has to give herself shots of insulin. I don’t think she’s ever let it go away. A diabetic is a systemically ill person in which the body could not process sugar, let alone control her blood sugar. I know Stacey does not have the same kind of diabetes.

In the beginning, Stacey seemed like no different from everyone else — outgoing, sensitive, sensitive. Then one day she turned out to be the opposite. She made her first decision, her best friend Claudia the Junk Food Queen — that she quit the BSC. Claudia and Stacey joined forces. She formed the club we still call the Club Claudia, which is our current mess. Claudia’s idea of a good sandwich is a crisp one. But Stacey can probably work that out someday. She’s a diabetic. She has to watch what she eats, but she also has to give herself shots of insulin to help her regulate her sugar levels. She still has diabetes, but Stacey’s doing it in another, more controlled way.

The BSC has two associate members, Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne
