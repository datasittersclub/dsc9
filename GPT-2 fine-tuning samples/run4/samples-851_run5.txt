, it was an old derby in the shape of a cross between a basketball and a soccer ball. Kristy's oldest brothers, Sam and Charlie, were crazy about it, and soon they were starting to bring their younger brother, David Michael, to practices. (He's five.) Then Kristy's dad walked out on the family and they were pretty much out of their old house. Then they met Mary Anne Spier, who introduced herself as an only child who moved into the house. She and Kristy's mom began seeing each other, and soon they had an even bigger family together. Then, when Mary Anne was in seventh grade, she and her mom began scheming to buy a new neighborhood and now they finally got married.

Kristy, naturally, is the BSC president.

Like most of the members of the club, she moved here when she was in grade school, just like the other club members. When she was closer to home, though, her family took a step back and faced tougher odds. For one thing, she and her mom went through a period of total spiritual over-simplity, and also some other sad thing.

But Kristy handles things pretty well now, and her tears have no doubting her honesty.

In fact, I do think about her a lot. Or maybe I should put that differently.

Now that I’ve told you a little about my family and about Mary Anne and me, let me tell you about my sister.

Mary Anne and her parents moved here after Stoneybrook Middle School, one of the best places in Stoneybrook for girls, closed. They bought the house they always lived at and moved in. For a house that was going to be a new home, like our old house has been, it’s a very welcome change.

So it’s a great oasis.

But let me tell you about the rest of our family — my brothers, Jessi and I, Claudia and Stacey, and Tigger, the ever-changing baby, and the four of us. We are the youngest members of the club. We aren’t too old for the BSC, but we are pretty young for our age. We’re the type of sitters who will stand up to older men and women who expect to be treated like children.

The problem is, we’re just not that good in school. We tend to get really lopsided scores in all those subjects, and that’s aggravated some of those men and boys, especially Jessi and me.

Jessi and I were especially lucky in math when we were in seventh grade; our families did allow us to get our ears pierced and (thank goodness!) get our hair cut short, but our parents aren’t exactly happy about this. (If you want to give me a hard time about this, I’ll explain it later.) Anyway, since we’re the eight-year-olds, they just can’t help it. They have tons of rules, but we always seem to get ahead.

Also, our families tend to be pretty different, which doesn’t bode well for our club. In fact, the Ramsey family was about to get a divorce. (Although Jessi and I weren’t thrilled about that until they found out their parents disapproved of their love of ballet.) Anyway, when Kristy’s mother wanted to get back together with another parent, things got a whole lot easier for the McGills. The Thomases moved in with the Ramseys, and since Jessi’s parents are divorced, she and Carol moved into the Thomas/Brewers’ huge farmhouse. There, Kristy usually lives — happily — next door to Mary Anne Spier, but this was all about to change.

Kristy is our Junk Food Fat Cat. Like Claudia and me, she has a serious eating disorder. I don’t think she eats sweets at all, and maybe that’s why she hates the idea of being declared a diabetic. As far as I can tell, she doesn’t. But, as Kristy often says, “Guess what!” She is diabetic, meaning her body doesn’t work too nicely (which doesn’t bother her at all, that’s for sure), but she has to give herself doses of insulin every day. Can you imagine taking one tiny pill a day? Zero. She has to be on insulin, even though diabetes is something that’sgetes her in the stomach. She has to go into a sleepover, eat something out of a bag of chips, and then wiggle around in that bag for a few more moments while she’s sleeping. Oh, and when she wakes up, she has to wear something to the next bed — stuff like swe
