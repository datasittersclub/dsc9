 themselves. (Yes, I said a certain Krushers fan who drives my BSC bus.)

Stacey has a new friend. Stacey Ramsey, our club's treasurer who takes care of the phone bill. But other than that she just happens to be our alternate officer now. That means she's responsible for collecting any dues that come in during our meetings. (We pay for alternate officers if we have any extra money left over.) Stacey also has to pay dues every Monday. That means she has to give a lot of money to the club — which, when we're working at night, she does pretty well.

Stacey has brown hair and freckles but she's not short at all. She's the shortest girl in our class — and the only girl in the whole sixth grade. She's also not smart, and her brown hair and glasses are pretty messed up. But her ideas are interesting.

The other girls in our club are my best friend, Jessi. She's a gifted athlete who loves to run, especially jumpers. Like me, she has braces and glasses (although I don't have to, of course). And like me, she's a big fan of ice cream, which isn't too shabby. She has no kids yet, but her aunt Janine has plans. In fact, Janine's the only other club member who has a steady boyfriend. Jessi's a dancer. She's a famous health food addict who's a good student, and always in good stead.

Jessi, though, has lots of talent. She has the longest legs of any girl I know, and she's graceful and athletic enough to get pretty far from her large brown eyes — even when she has her braces. Sometimes she wears glasses (the club uniform), but those don't apply to her, so she doesn't have to. She even grew up wearing contacts, which are kind of cool looking, but look like braces.

Our record book is not big, by anyone's standards. We use it for all of our schedules (boy, does my brother Jeff write us regularly) and the club record book is a good record of everything we do at our house. We also keep a club notebook in which we write up every jobs we go on, and we schedule our sitters across our jobs. The notebook is good for keeping track of all our sitting jobs. There are seven members of the BSC, and most of them are associate members (they don't get to go to Stoneybrook Middle School, but they do join the club when they can). They don’t come to meetings, but they know how to get involved in the club.

Since we are a small club with only one member, the record book becomes less of a zoo and more of a real life. In the past year, we have become an actual club, though. We’ve taken on junior officers temporarily, since we still have several weeks to go before we graduate to our junior officers job. We are all so busy with baby-sitting that we just can’t leave the house.

The BSC also has three associate members — Mal and Jessi. We call them junior officers, because they’re not ready to sit for their own families yet. Mal and Jessi like to write books and paint, so they get to concentrate on that. Mal, on the other hand, likes to write. She’d like to see her writing career to be over by the time she gets to seventh grade, but that won’t happen for at least a year.

Anyway, I’ve mentioned how important it is to take good care of yourself and stick to your diet. It’s also why some of my friends and I often complain that we’re too young for baby-sitting. We can’t really tell, though, since it could be pretty serious. We’re used to sitting in the middle of everyone else’s house every morning. So it’s not as if it’s a secret that we’re not ready to be bunks.

I know that the BSC (and the movie) is coming to Broadway not far from Stoneybrook. We hope so. We are the original Stoneybrook Baby-sitters Club and we keep the secret up until last. We didn’t want to upset anyone. In fact, we were hoping the BSC would make a mistake. We needed a big hit to keep the club going: an extra member to keep things going smoothly. The more we raised the funds, the more we decided to make an addition.

The main idea was to have a club in which our clients would be able to call one number (which would also be just one phone call away) and arrange a sitting job. We also wanted to get our charges to be comfortable taking late-night jobs.
