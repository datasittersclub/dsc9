! That night, she had just sat there in bed, shaking her head.

“I've just started my second book,” she explained. And that was before I’d gotten the Baby-sitters Club job.

“That’s because we need help with two important books — science and poetry.” I could swear Mary Anne was going to get really angry.

“So what’s in the book?” Stacey asked.

“It’s a study in children’s literature.” Stacey was frowning.

“Oh,” Kristy said. “I haven’t read one yet — and I think that’s bad enough, since the subjects are so advanced.”

“Well, it’s kind of … well … I don’t know too much about that stuff,” I said, turning away from Mary Anne. “Maybe she should read it instead. For people like me … I mean, I don’t want to read anything that isn’t advanced — but it looks great.”

“Oh, ‘magnificent?” Kristy said.

“What about that — that was not advanced?” Stacey objected. “If that were to fall outside, you would have to be in the air or on top of a building and be in control of your breath.”

“Aaaah!” Stacey gasped.

“You could jump into the air and pull yourself out of the ground,” Kristy began, rising to her knees and leaning back in the director’s chair. In a flash, Kristy’s face looked as green as night.

“Oh, but what about that?” Mary Anne asked.

“Well, no,” Kristy replied. “I don’t think you can. Not in a million years. My theory is that you were swept into this air not long ago by the winds of your imagination.”

“My theory?” Claudia asked.

“No way!” Stacey replied. “I am not a physicist, and neither am I the director of your book. But I do have a theory that … you should go see a meteorologist. It’s going to be awful. That’s why I’d like Dr. Watson.”

“No way!” everyone shrieked.

“Okay,” Claudia said, and the baby-sitting book flew clear over the audience. Kristy looked at Mary Anne. “She doesn’t need that book. She can go to a doctor. She’s already there. She needs to go check out a bunch of little babies. I could go look in their mouths a mile. I don’t know how you can stop people. What did she do? She swept me into the air like a hurricane.”

“He was like that,” Claudia told Stacey, “when you were all swept back into the air and you did not let yourself be swept away. He must have felt it.”

“I felt something too,” Stacey admitted.

“Dawn did too,” Claudia said.

“But he let you be,” Stacey said again.

Stacey was right. I was not. I’d just been the first one of the four kids to be swept, and I’ve been swept two other times, too. I should have known that. But I didn’t know enough to remember, either.

The only thing I’d forgotten is that Mary Anne, our club secretary, had just returned from visiting her father on his estate in New York. It wasn’t so surprising that she had arrived just before Mary Anne arrived. The first thing Mary Anne noticed after Mary Anne’s arrival was that she was really dressed very much like Mary Anne. She had these really big brown tops and a very white legging that looked like a model’s. Her blonde, curly hair was swept back with braids, she was perched on a big rock that looked like a giant lighthouse, her ankles were swept back, her brown skirts were swept back. Even her shoes were painted red and had beads on them on each toe (one of her favorite colors, I think, from the beach!). There were no knee socks or ankle boots. She was wearing a plain black coat and a white shirt with a white stripe, tied with a pink collar that she pulled down. The fabric was woven like a woven silk ribbon, so
