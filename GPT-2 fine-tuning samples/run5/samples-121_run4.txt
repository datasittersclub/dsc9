 Mall in the club? It's a huge idea.

“I don’t think it’s possible to get a job with such a huge list of clients.” Kristy said over a cup of hot tea. “We need to talk to the director of the business school for a job.<|endoftext|>
Kristy said she had read the article in a big, red headline.

She looked surprised at the thought. Was she the only one who guessed such a thing?

“Actually, I don’t know,” I said.

Kristy, at this rate, would never believe the word "incredible." I’m sure she wouldn’t. She’ll, I guess, be president of the BSC.

As president of the club, I am not only the only one with a BSC record book. I have three associate members (all associate members), and one vice-president of the club, Emily Michelle, the associate. I have a lot of friends I don’t talk to. The rest of us just hang out with Kristy, especially Jessi and Mallory. They’re my best friend.

Jessi is my best friend. She goes out the back sometimes, and she likes sports, too. She likes to dance, so the BSC has a special dance program for her. Jessi loves to read, and she’s also the oldest in the club. The BSC has strict rules regarding books with a picture on it.

Another member of the club is Mallory Pike, who is the second oldest in the club. She is the oldest girl in the club. She just became the vice-president because of a problem with her math spelling. She said it couldn’t be solved until Kristy had made sure it wasn’t by mistake. So everyone was just sitting around her, trying to solve the spelling problem.

One of the things we use in meetings is a phone book. Usually it’s one of the more challenging things in the club. But we always use it anyway in meetings because it can be overwhelming, especially if your age is one of our problems.

We pay Kristy’s family a lot of money, since we’re on call for meetings. You do pay her a lot of money because you’re Kristy’s best friend, too, and because we have a baby sitter (I never knew her until I met her). I have a baby sitter, Claud, and in the past two years we went from being the Baby-sitters Club of Kristy’s family to being the club of only three baby sitters. We also have a few regular clients, and we keep our expenses in a record book, but, hey, it’s just an added benefit when you’re Kristy.

“I want to make contact and offer you a job,” said Kristy, as her voice sounded like a record book.

I didn’t think I would. I was just thinking of my mother’s phone number.

“I want to speak to a baby-sitter of yours,” Kristy added before I could finish saying good-bye.

I could sense in her voice the urge to say good-bye. It seemed like a great thing to do — to offer her a job. I could tell she was looking forward to it.

“Thanks, Mary Anne,” I replied.

She nodded. “Thanks again. You must be crazy!”

“Thanks for giving me an idea of what I wanted to talk to you about —”

“Well, then, I hope you liked this baby-sitting idea.”

Claudia leaned back in the book her desk was in, looking thoughtful and impressed.

“Hello, Ms. Kishi?” Claud asked as she held up the clipboard, “of Claudia Kishi, our regular BSC secretary. “I have a special meeting scheduled for this Monday, and it's time for me to talk to you.”

I glanced at the schedule and checked the BSC record book. “The meeting will be held, Tuesday, from 7-8th. This meeting takes place, just outside of my office.”

“What time is Monday, Claud?” asked Claudia. “What time is Wednesday?”

Claudia turned and pointed to the clock. “I’m going to need your help. And my brother’s going to be there.<|endoftext|>
“Let me tell you to go out and talk with everybody!” (C
