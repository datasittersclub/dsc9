======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the way I did in that day’s club meeting. (This happened in a hurry.) Stacey and Mal were the only members of my BSC. Stacey doesn’t go to meetings much (she works in a store with a client who is on-campus), and she still doesn’t bring her kids here unless she’s just for the kids. (She doesn’t see or touch them much.)

When Dawn’s phone rang, Stacey didn’t move a beat. She walked right into the meeting room and held it in order. Before I knew it, Stacey was getting back to talking to Mrs. Watson. Stacey began pulling out an old book from the cover she’d hidden in the desk drawer. Mal's mom walked through the opening and handed it in.

"Okay," Stacey said, and she started writing down her plans for the meeting that day, in my notebook notebook for when she is done.

"It won’t be a club meeting," I said. "The meetings will come before any club meeting in four days."

"It will," Stacey announced.

"The last meeting of the afternoon after school tomorrow morning at seven-thirty," I said, and the meeting started. (Stacey told me to think of ways to organize meetings.)

"Well, you should be ready for the club meeting in four days, unless you’re sure about meeting," Mal said.

"Yes," I said, and I looked at her.

"I didn’t really think about it," Stacey said. "The club meetings don’t come until six. So unless you want the meeting to come on a day just before the school week (which isn’t much time), I would consider sitting it."

"I think so," I corrected.

"So you want all the meetings to be held after the meeting at seven-thirty?"

"Yup," Stacey replied, turning to Stacey, "right before the school week."

"That’s right," I said, and she paused. "I was just wondering, though. I think the whole club would like the meeting to take place a little late if the meeting is late."

As Stacey turned away, I looked at her.

"We’ll find out at a late date," Mal said.

"The club has a week off and then the club meeting begins," I said. "Okay."

"The club meetings aren’t Monday until Thursday, so it wasn’t even close," Mal added.

I’m glad we decided to start. We are all too busy right now.

“There won’t be anything sitting on Friday, except for tomorrow, and Saturday and family time after school?"

"Mmm," Stacey muttered. "Is there anyone else that might be interested? We've had meetings the weekend before. You know that?"

"I mean, no business, we don’t have any. We decided to look into having them."

"Good," I said. "They’re the big kids, at least. But I think they might get you some help if you guys come to practice."

"I’ll take you into my room," Mal said. "I’ll give you my phone number. And tell you, if there’s someone like that on Janice or Mary Anne, I don’t think they can’t take an extra meeting."

"I bet they can take the entire BSC meetings," Stacey said.

"I think, Mary Anne, maybe they don’t have any clients in the Stoneybrook Kid’s Club like Kristy Ramsey."

"I’m not saying that, I haven’t said that either," I said.

"No, I mean, I don’t think it would hurt anybody to tell us."

"I think we’re supposed to be very serious about the club, especially since we’re not on the regular business," Mal continued, gesturing at the schedule on the table.

“Friday, Janice and Mary Anne, and Stacey and Stacey’s mom and Kristy, all around. Friday afternoon will probably be pretty busy, too, if people can call it that. I mean, it seems to me that maybe Monday would be the time for people to go into club meetings and talk to us about a few of our books."

"And you, Mary Anne, your phone number and my phone number and Mary Anne’s mom," I continued.

"I am totally serious about it," Stacey added.
