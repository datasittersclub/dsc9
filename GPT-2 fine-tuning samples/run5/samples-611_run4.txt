 kind he really is. I've known him all my life and he usually falls in line behind me when I'm on my way to a movie or to a meeting, and sometimes he even takes the bus when I'm not. He's a great kid, and a lot of good responsibility.

Next are BSC members. We don't have many regular members, but Kristy has seven. They all belong to one of the bigger baby-sitters clubs, called the BSC. Kristy and her family moved into a house on the other side of Stoneybrook, and even though she and her mom are very different, they seem to have a good family. And I think Claudia’s grandmother Mimi used to live with them as well.

You see, when Mimi died, Kristy lived for a long time with her grandmother. So what did she do after she arrived in Stoneybrook? She took care of some of her other pets: a gray kitten named Tigger, a two-and-a-half-year-old rat named Pike, and a half-eaten egg named Foal. (It’s not until the last chapter that we see the full impact Mimi had on Kristy’s life.) But it was in the pets she gave up that we’ve come to appreciate her best. Kristy was also the first of us to have a steady boyfriend. His name is Logan Bruno and he’s seventeen years old, and he’s the oldest of eight kids. Kristy has a reputation for being strict, and we don’t fault her with being strict. We fault her for not being patient enough. But at least she went about her normal life as planned.

How does Kristy deal with a boyfriend? She tries hard. At first they broke up, but she’s never, ever made a mistake. He’s a great guy and someone who knows the house perfectly. Plus, at first he made us uncomfortable, but we finally began to understand that it couldn’t be any worse.

And then it was okay. Kristy was accepting of her differences, and in some ways, accepting of us too. I mean it.

Logan is still so nice. When we first met him, he was sitting on the floor in gray khakis, a uniform-style. He looked good in that, just like the other members of the BSC. But just as we were getting warmer over the holiday, the phone rang.

I decided to take down the package so we could send it back to Stacey. I figured that if I received it, I would be the first to do it. I didn’t need Logan, though. And I don’t think Stacey would be surprised if we split the package equally, because when we got around to sending the letter, Shannon broke down and found me okay. (I told her about this in a previous article. She’ll be the last. Not her usual, I think.)

I received the letter in one sitting and received it in the other. Stacey listened to it and explained, while Logan said he had no idea what he looked like. (If you ever go to a movie with Mallory, you’ll see that she’s incredibly sensitive. There’s nothing she can’t do to calm the feelings of another movie star. In fact, I think I’ve never met a best friend more sensitive.)

This was going to be the last time I received the letter. I knew it would be hard to keep away the other ones, since Shannon was already speechless. As soon as we received the letter, I let out a big yawn and buried my face in the pillow, looking at the three (three, if you believe me) letters I’d send that I’d received.

When I got back to my room, Stacey was waiting for me. She folded the paper into a zit and tore open a package of M&M’s and Twinkies.

Stacey gave Stacey one of the Twinkies in return for a hand at the M&M’s that day. (She is a total junk food addict.) We knew right away. We clicked, clicked, clicked. It took almost a week to work our way through those packages. We received a list of allergist–recommended ingredients as well as names, phone numbers, basic needs, and other important information. And then the packages were delivered. I was glad about that. I really had to be careful where and with which children I was visiting.

Stacey handed the M&M’s to Mallory, who was sitting next to me on the bed. Then she slid them into a sealed envelope, which she carefully folded. As soon as she was done, the front
