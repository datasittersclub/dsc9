. This time, the kids weren't scared. Neither was they afraid of chocolate. Instead, the kids seemed pretty happy.

Kristy Thomas is our president. She has blonde hair and freckles underneath. She lives near me. The rest of my family lives in the city. And her house is pretty much a zoo. (Well, it used to be, but I don't know how I could live in one!) I don't know any of her pets, but I do get to visit her while she's in town (she makes a fine host).

Before I go any further, it should be mentioned that I'm vice-president because I'm a whiz at math. That title would have to say I tend to dress in shorts and tights, with jeans or a T-shirt underneath. I prefer a long-sleeve shirt with running shoes. Maybe my wardrobe reflects that, too. I'd have to be shirtless for meetings, although I have some pretty neat vest-wearing (especially since my parents disapprove of my style of dress).

If you take my math class three days before I leave California, you'll see right through my clothes how much I hate gym, especially with a boyfriend named Travis Hill. He has a serious sports brain — and his schedule is full of gym and after-school activities. And he's awesome.

In fact, I've been saying that for years — and it’s true — Travis is the best jock in California. But I’ve got something else in common, too. I’m a good student. I get to speak with my face painted purple, and I’ll listen to an old-time Benny Hill sing my favorite song.

And I’ve always had trouble understanding a word I said I’d say when I went to bed early — not only because it wasn’t my birthday but also because I didn’t understand a word and couldn’t tell whether to say it or not.

So I did a little homework and studied Benny’s great new tune. I could tell Travis’s a terrible jock, but I thought he’d listen.

In a few minutes, I’d done the math, and there’d been plenty of practice at school. So in the next class I’d been studying that tune, and discovered, like I was about to tell you, there had been a lot of work that had been missed.

One day, I could make up to nine words in my mind right there on the page of a computer program, without having to repeat my homework. Wouldn’t that be a big help to my math homework? I was amazed.

“Aaaaand” I said, running my finger along the clock, “towards the end of seventh!”

“The last thing they need is,” said a voice over the phone. “One minute!”<|endoftext|>
“We’ll buy you a ticket to a show at the Lincoln Center,” said Stacey McGill. We were sitting in her room waiting for the BSC meeting to officially begin.

“Oh, my lord!” I shrieked, and flopped on her bed. I took her bag of potato chips out of my pocket, and stuffed each into my hair. It just so happened that the potato chips were one yellow potato chip wrapper with a picture of Stacey on one side, and a picture of a woman holding potato chips in the other.

“Hey! That’s a girl, you know, the one with her curly blonde hair, white lips, and blue eyes. She might be a real star.”

We looked at each other. There was a slight frown on each of our faces. But we both groaned. Stacey always puts the worst face possible.

“She can pick a perfect picture or two.” I tried to grin, and Stacey said, “All right — you’ll have to. Don’t be alarmed, though. Her potato chips will come in the shape of stars.”

Stacey grinned. “I'm not kidding. I want them today.”

We sat back and watched our favorite celebrity eat one of our potato chips — who ever gave a potato chip to a celebrity? — in a flash. The first star was Dawn Schafer, a dancer known for dancing with big red lips and huge, shiny blue eyes. That day, my dad gave her a huge red kiss.

It didn’t stop there. Stacey’s mom, Sharon, gave Dawn a hug. It was awesome!

“Oh, come on,” Stacey said, tossing
