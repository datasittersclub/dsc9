 the way to my apartment, for one thing. I was worried about how to pay the phone bill.<|endoftext|>
As we sat at my mother's house in the quiet neighborhood near Bradford Court, we watched the clock change from 5:28 to 5:30. Dad was in the process of calling everyone back to New York. It was late, but by then we were pretty tired of this weird little project we'd been having with our parents.

Still, I knew Dad would probably call us home one more time. We were not in a hurry.

“Where’s he usually? It’s all the way home.”

We stood there, our heads bowed in confusion. Then Dad answered Dad’s phone and said he needed a sitter. Dad, who had called Mom, called Mom back. Dad took out a large manila envelope and began counting the people we sit for on rainy days. “Where’s he usually?”

“He’s usually all right,” I said. But there was something else going on in this whole house.

“Oh,” Dad said, “He says he’s in Europe,”” sopping at Dad. “I don’t agree with everything that he says.”

Dad checked the envelope twice and picked up a manila envelope. “What’s he doing in the meeting?” he asked.

“Well, he’s going to take a look at the book Mr. and Mrs. Papadakis are publishing,” said Dad calmly.

Mary Anne didn’t wave, but her body language made me wonder why she didn’t let him see books by L.A. author Nancy Drew before they hit bookstores. She did, but she hadn’t seen them in person. Besides, Mary Anne doesn’t mind getting scolded, but don’t we all?

“I know him,” explained Mary Anne, “but in Europe?”

“Yes, but in Claudia’s private library.”

“Claudia’s best friend, too.”

Then we asked my mother, who sat in my room, what was wrong with letting the Papadakises read her books, and what could have been done about it.

“I don’t mind,” I told her. “But it’s not something I need to talk about anymore.”

“So what’s the point anymore?” asked Dad. We spent five minutes talking. It didn’t help that he was trying to be very cordial.

No problem, though.

We began to talk about my friend. “Well,” asked Dad, “you are the best friend I’ve ever had,” but he didn’t say anything about me. He was just looking at the back of my room a lot.

Somehow my mother survived Dad’s look and said, “I guess we should start talking about it. I guess it was all a misunderstanding. I guess —”

“But she didn’t say anything,” began Dad. “She said —”

“Yes, Mrs. Papadakises mentioned it to her and said —”

All of a sudden, the phone ran out of the bank. Dad called my mother and sat down to talk about some of our problems. I had to leave the front door open, or I wouldn’t have been able to sit by myself for Claudia and my friends.

It was about six o’clock when Stacey called my mom to tell her that she was going to contact Claudia. I sat at the table in the front living room, my dad and Claudia on either side of me. I felt like going to the library. Stacey was acting really nice since she’d call Mrs. Papadakises and tell her we would be free at six. I was a little nervous but relaxed. At that time, I was still a teenager and Stacey hadn’t given me permission yet to talk.

I had a great idea. I was going to come over here with my father. Why not have a sitter with the Papadakises every Friday afternoon on Wednesday? No problem.

“What are you talking about?” Mrs. Papadakiseski asked. “Why don’t you come over for Friday?”

“I know you’re going to be able to, but I don’t
