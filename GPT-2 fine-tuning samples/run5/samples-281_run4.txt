 one would have it right. I wouldn’t mind if some of her brothers’s toys were made of cardboard, like I’d love to make my own toys!

Kristy had an interesting story about her mother during one of our regular meetings. The other day, a girl was sitting for the same class at a special school she had. This time her mom was still wearing a pink shirt with a yellow tights, white tie, and yellow velvet pants. Her dad was gone for a little while. Mrs. Thomas moved to that part of town. Then it turned out her mom had married her. The new girl moved with her mom to live with the Thomas family.

“I see.” Mrs. Thomas moved out of the school with her mom, too. Her family moved across town to her. There are a lot of other big families in Stoneybrook not far from here.”

A smile crossed Mrs. Thomas’s face. “Well, there’ve to be eight of us here,” she said, and held her in her arms. “It’s sort of like an old farmhouse. I mean it’s not quite a farmhouse but it’s very loud and full of people.”

“Okay, then, we’ll sit at your house.” I pointed toward the kitchen. “What’s the easiest thing for Kristy?”

“I guess it depends,” Mrs. Thomas replied, “we can take the rest of her to my room and she’s warm and we’ll just have to call you back.”

Then she gave us all two spoons of tea, a glass of milk, and some sugar and freshly ground pepperoni. The others were still held up to my eyes by Kristy, who was on the bed again. “It’s a good thing I’m so happy to be back here,” she said. “I know I’ll be lonely this week. I’m glad I came back.”

“I wish,” I said, “this time about the trip.” “Can you tell me how it really turned out?”

Kristy nodded. “I know about one thing nobody ever did for me.”

“But the other thing,” I finished. “I never realized my family would never be such a huge family. Just two kids in a single house, with a mom and a dad.”

“But,” I added quickly, “nobody had ever known about my family before.”

Claudia took another spoonful and swallowed, too.

The rest of us listened. “And I had to leave a little too soon.”

I had to. But I felt better. I knew my mom was free to decide what to do.

I told Claudia and Kristy not to worry about the trip again. They weren’t quite sure what to do, but I took them back. I said we’ve been invited to come back to Stoneybrook. They didn’t talk about it after that — they just said it wasn’t right that the trip was delayed. That’s why we invited them back.

What did they say now?”

“I didn’t know how the trip was going to go.”

“But what do they mean?” I asked.

They said we were going to visit a children’s hospital and watch a performance by Suzi Barrett, a children’s movie by the Barrett brothers. I didn’t know what it would be like to watch a play by a really great violin player. I asked them about my parents and they said my parents would see it and think it was necessary. That was the best part about that part.

We asked them everything we could think of about the trip. They told us all about my grandparents and my aunt, about our father and my mother, and about being abandoned by my little brother, Charlie, who is seven. We asked about my Aunt Cecelia, my grandmother, and the Barrett kids. They told us about every big event in my life, and every sad experience.

I told everyone about the accident in order to make them feel welcome. As I lay there on the bed, trying to imagine what I’d become, I realized something — I was really a victim of a terrible, terrible accident. I was in a horrible coma in the hospital after being hit by a train. The accident was totally unexpected and unimaginable for someone born and raised in New York City. I was
