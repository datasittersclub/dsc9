 money. If you have ever wanted a real job — especially after you'd married your first — you could imagine this was all going to blow up. I'd already decided to live in New York. I had already moved into a very cool apartment — which, in turn, meant I was ready to go to work for someone else. (That's what it is. This is a New York City neighborhood.) I sat across from John H. Sullivan, a writer for The New York Times. Mr. Sullivan was sitting next to him on his way to see his doctor-bob appointments. When I asked him if he knew anyone who would have any jobs, he said he had no idea. I asked him what, after a few years, he would do. "I'll sit down with my friends," he said. I told him about the two new jobs. "I got a big fat raise, but I can't find one," he said. I told him what I was getting into when I told him about the job.

The next day, though, things were a lot different. As soon as Sullivan gave up hope of staying at one of New York's best restaurants, he said he'd give up, too — he'd become very depressed and couldn't keep up. I could only tell by his look at his friends, which was sad. I'd heard that he'd moved a lot from New York City in his eight-month-old baby-sitting life, but that was too bad: he'd moved to California five years earlier. He loved California. He'd been so good at basketball that he earned the nickname "Elmer." But life in California is more challenging, and Mr. Sullivan had become a real estate agent. I was already seeing him for the first time. Even though he'd moved a bunch of stuff around during his eight months in California, he was still very happy in California.

I said, "You better wait a minute then. It could be all right. Here I am after a day off," and Mr. Sullivan started calling me and telling me that he'd moved some toys around to keep us entertained.

Before long, the job was done! The New York Times had gotten on very well. Mrs. Nott and her boyfriend are out in the country now, and Mrs. Nott, who died in 2010, is a famous TV host and writer who has appeared on many TV shows. (Her book The New York Times Year of the Times: Life, Times and the News is out now.) That made her even more beloved, since she lives up, and she has so much in common with Mr. Sullivan with her boyfriend, Richard.

Anyway, there it is. Mr. Sullivan got married. Then I got married. And Mr. Sullivan got an Oscar. All in all, the ceremony was a lot of fun. (I also saw my two best friends, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, take the best picture of Mr. Brown I could find — a photo of Mr. Brown sitting on his lap in the restaurant in California. Then I met David Brant, and I fell in love.)

The ceremony was the first of many. As it turns out, Mr. Sullivan and Mrs. Brown had never heard of each other until they moved to New York City in July of 1982. Then, after a few months of marriage, David and Eliza and I both decided that we would move into this apartment. Eliza is really, really sweet, and Emily is the kind of girl who just can't stand being around other people anymore.

So we got together. That's when we met and married, and Mr. Sullivan and Mrs. Brown started dating. (It got off to a slow start, though.)

So where did this all go wrong? Mr. Sullivan and Mrs. Brown went so far as to get into so many things they couldn't even write down what was going on. They'd already started the "We'll be in a room to listen if you ask" business as usual. But they also had a new book-totaling baby. I guess that's what you need — anything they write down.

The next day we got the call at 9:30 — it was Kristy and I in the lobby with two guys. As I looked between us, Mrs. Brown, Kristy and the other kids were making the phone call. "Kristy, Kristy and I have another baby!" They were shouting, and Kristy said, "Kristy! Kristy got her haircut. Do you think it's her?" I said, laughing. "Kristy," they all added up, "that's what I want to hear — she has to wait to be checked in." So Kristy takes the phone home.

I look around at the kids. I mean, you should listen to Kristy if you don't know when Kristy is in her room — except for when she wakes
