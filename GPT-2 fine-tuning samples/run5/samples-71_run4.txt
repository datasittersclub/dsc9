, so it shouldn't matter. I don

t care much about the clothes, so why not try something nice? (I haven

referred to the outfit as "sock, sweater, or baseball cap".)

I didn’t care if the colors belonged to a certain kind of fashion accessory, especially I was still going to wear my outfit as soon as I’d’get to school and, um, I couldn’t afford a sweatshirt. I wanted to wear it at school, but because of my hair, I didn’t have the time to do it. (So, if you’re going to school this summer, wear it at school.)

So we started planning the perfect date. (Okay, I’ll be honest with you. I was really disappointed when I heard that the BSC would be meeting the time — and I was thinking about making a big mistake about it, anyway.)

I’ve had my ups and downs over the last week, but on the Wednesday we were going to be meeting up, I had a really great idea:

I’d have some fun with some friends. I would like to show some of the BSC members my club calendar, as well as how we’re going to keep up with every new challenge we get. I would also like to introduce some of the members to one of my favorite books, my favorite fashion statement, and my favorite art project: the Mary Anne’s Day poem.

The club calendar will show what we’ve been up to, plus I’d like to invite each member to an author’’s workshop (she’s my junior official!) I would like to talk about some of my favorites, and I would like to write a series of short stories about a popular children’ book from my sister Dawn and my mother, Mary Anne Thomas.

So we did an awful job. We had no clue how to organize a meeting. Why? We were so busy we didn’t have time to organize it all. Why not just call my secretary?

“I think I need to go to the library or something. I’ve learned that the school calendar's so strict that I’m afraid I’d have to go to a place where the schedules are so strict that I should miss school, too.”

I think I’m not going to miss a meeting of our club.

I mean, the club calendar is what would make our meeting so strict, even though it’s a very important resource for the BSC and the school system, and I guess we all have the same reason.

The club calendar, and Mary Anne’s Day, are two things I need to do when I’re at work. I’ve only been out of the city for nine days. And Mary Anne is not going to be out for just that.

At least, not until after I’m full. That’s a lot of phone time, but it’s not as bad as she could be.

And don’t get me started if you’re not familiar with my life (I’m a math major, a guy), but I’m going to end this part of my life with this announcement:

I’m moving to California on a rainy Monday, and it’s going to be a rainy Monday.”

I told myself that this was going to be an awful announcement, and I had to be careful. But now that I know what it could be, I guess it’s been a real joke!

I was a little nervous about all of this, but it was one of the best things about meeting Mary Anne’s Day that day. It’s one of the happiest things about meeting Mary Anne. It really has been.

What’s it like in California?

I’ll say, it’ll be a different kind of life in a few days. I’ll never be a woman of any kind since I’m already very much in love with my boyfriend, Sam. That is, until now, I’ve been very different from one day to the next. I’ve never been an active person in a really long time, let alone a person who has been in love with a guy for some time.

I don’t think I would be alone. But I’m not in California, and even though I’ve been away from friends, family, and stuff like that (mostly because of my parents), I still don’t like being away. Also not being able to watch television, which is what I’re into. I love sports
