�s the one who said, "Who'd like to work on a new feature?" and the rest are like that. I always do, especially if I'm having a big baby-sitting project in the works.

Kristy's other best friend in the BSC is Mary Anne Spier. They're very different in that few people think they look alike. Neither of them has any of the very similar looks and she has long dark hair and a casual wardrobe style I don't think Kristy looks at. Mary Anne looks great, although her hair just doesn't look the way she wants it to. She's originally from New York City and still goes there on several weekends a year. Mary Anne and Kristy have known each others names for a long time, but no longer. In fact, they look a lot alike and have become close friends. Mary Anne always wears her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail and brown eyes. (She's Japanese-American.) But neither of them really knows Mary Anne's mother and father, even though they do know each other. Kristy never misses an opportunity to tell their mom, "Mom, you know what I think? I'm going to have a baby of your own. Isn't that neat? You know, a lot of things about my family that I really like." (Kristy has her doubts. She's in love with a really nice guy. He's really rich.)

Kristy's the BSC's treasurer, which means she collects dues every Monday. On Mondays and Wednesdays she collects dues and pays our expenses, like our gas money and phone bill and Charlie and Alan Arnold diapers. When she's not sitting around our rooms answering phone calls, Kristy is a whirlwind: creative, funny, a junk-food fanatic, and a very full-fledged health food lover.

If I were to list all the things I would have to learn, Kristy would be it. (I mean, she would have to be at the cutting block, but I suppose most things are reserved for advanced students.) Kristy is an excellent baby-sitter. She knows exactly what I'm doing and when. She even knows when I'm supposed to be at the kitchen. The only time Kristy wouldn't be an excellent, full-grown-up baby-sitter is if she really loved kids, like when she was doing just that. Kristy would absolutely love baby-sitting for a Bernese mountain dog puppy named Shannon Kilbourne. Shannon's her big blue stud dog and Kristy's the one who took all the kids to her house to help put together the Saddle Club. Shannon and Kristy's dog, a fluffy brown puppy named RJ, do a lot of entertaining, too.

Kristy's most basic work: keeping track of our appointments. She doesn't like to put a lot of work into it, but she knows it's necessary. This is one of Kristy's main convictions that keeps her company. She is the only club member with at least one associate member who isn't a real associate. That means one of a kind blood relatives, a secretary, a cat-and-mouse game (Kristy's kitten, Tigger, who's a puppy) and many others. It's a good thing that Mary Anne has a good math teacher, since she's not a math whiz. That teacher is Claudia Kishi, who is one of the original members of the BSC. What a wild ride she's had. Her theories on math, and the way she thinks about people, are also very interesting and interesting, and I have to say that Claudia is brilliant at it. Claudia is really an artistic genius, with art projects that are artistic in the original fashion sense.

She lives near Mary Anne, and also near her dad (her mom's job). It took Kristy some time to adjust to her new life and life in Charlotte, so it's much easier for her. Claudia (who is Japanese-American, like Kristy) grew up very strictly a Japanese-American girl. She's not allowed to wear the same kind of clothes twice a week (or even to that), and she has to give herself injections of pot (a very strange experience for me), and stick to very conservative weight-lifting practices. Claudia doesn't think eating sugar is a big problem, although she also never makes the diet her personal project. She just follows a strict diet, and even though sugar is one of her strong points, it's not a lifelong thing. She's starved, which is something Kristy handles well.

Claudia’s a junk food fanatic, even if she doesn’t think junk food is a big deal. She also loves the idea of having a permanent hiding place, which is what Kristy and I are both crazy about in the first place. Claud has long, reddish-brown hair, brown eyes, and a constant expression of her health. Her body contains
