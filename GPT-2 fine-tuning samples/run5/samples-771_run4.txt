Luckily, she's very friendly, and when she can't be contacted, we call her.

I think Jessi and Mallory are going to be best friends forever. They're very close. And they're even more different than I already said. The two of them look alike, though. They're both small with brown eyes and curly dark brown hair. Jessi has medium-dark brown skin, while Mallory has dark brown. I don't know anyone else's personality like Jessi, but I do know that Jessi is pretty romantic. Her parents are divorced, and her dad lives in the city. She's friendly and outgoing, and she's always coming to BSC meetings to see the puppies.

I'm also going to tell you that not only do the members of the BSC have different interests and opinions, but they have to share as much as possible about their own families. Becca, for example, has a condition called diabetes. That means Becca doesn't get enough exercise, though she does gain a certain amount every year in terms of memory size. Jessi and Mallory do have a few things in common, though. They both love to read horse stories and mysteries, so they're perfectly happy to be hanging around with each other.

Jessi and Mallory are identical twins. Mall is African-American, and black. Jessi is talented, in a good way, academically. She's so athletic that she could be a track star. Plus, she's totally gorgeous, with jet-black hair and creamy skin. She has great-tongue-dark, almond-colored skin, and dark almond-shaped earlobes (not deep, but bubbly, either). Mall has a condition called brittle bone in her body. That's a kind of malignant disease that constantly interferes with the way she acts, so doctors can only give a mild, minor setback to a problem.

Mall's not in the BSC. She belongs to another club called the We ♥ Kids Club. She's in touch with us constantly, though, because she's our president — and not just because she thought of the idea, hatched it, or inspired it.

We are the most junior members of the BSC, although we're better prepared for our age. Take Mall when she stepped down as alternate officer, for instance. She's been great, too, our secretary. She handles everything else, including scheduling appointments and providing for the kids. In addition to being our resident secretary she also plays games and writes up our schedules.

Mal has curly red hair, glasses, and braces (the clear kind), and she's pretty short. She's an only child who grew up in Stoneybrook, but just happens to be an only child once — until she met her future husband, Dawn Schafer, who's seven. After they fell in love and got married, Dawn moved back to California to live with her dad. (Because of her mother, she has only one child now.) Oh, and she's a wild dresser. She wants to be an author-illustrator of children's books. Here's what Mall thinks about the Baby-sitters Club. First of all, they're all weird. Second, they're all very practical and practical. Isn't it interesting that people, like Mall, are so practical in practical ways? That a person can be practical and practical at the same time makes sense. They each have a practical side, and it certainly makes sense that parents want them to be practical and practical side.

"I can make a big difference in the lives of some kids," Mall says.

"I can."

Shannon Barrett-Thomas and Mary Anne Spier were the first in the club to join. They were the first two people to make Mall and join the club together, since they happen to be best friends, which was very funny because they are parents of identical twins. Then they started talking about what they wanted to do.

"When I talk about what we want to do — what would be great for them — I always think about Mall's incredible art. Can you imagine?" I ask. It seems to me that if the BSC were a chess team, Mall would be the president.

"She'll be a math whiz," Mary Anne says with a smile.

"What do you mean?" (Mary Anne doesn't like to use the word math in her sentences, but I think it's an acceptable term if you're going to be a BSC member. I could understand Mall's love of numbers; she just happens to have some big ideas for organizing people's lives, like the Kid-Kits, for instance.)

"What would happen if she were to take the Baby-sitters Club to the next level?" I ask, glancing at Shannon.

"Great," Mall says. "Now I have my picture taken
