The BSC has seven officers, and four alternate members. The seven main ones are Jessi and Mal. The rest of us are associate members, jobs we get when we're extra busy with jobs.

I'll never forget the first meeting of the Baby-sitters Club. It was Monday, June 5, 1991, in Stoneybrook Court. Claudia Kishi, Jessi Ramsey, Mallory Pike, and I were seated in Claudia's director's chair, my usual spot for the BSC meetings, next to Stacey McGill. I was checking my book, waiting for Kristy Thomas, who was in the room. Kristy was asking Jessi and Mal if they could join and she said no problem.

Jessi and Mal told us they needed more sitters and jobs to prepare for the Christmas Day meeting. Another surprise for Kristy was that Stacey had quit as an associate member. She'd been chosen to run the meeting and lead the meeting's extra work (one of her main duties) around to the end of the month instead of as an alternate member. Her position meant that she would attend meetings as often as she could, with the regular club members taking over Jessi's job. But Stacey had to leave her best friend, Mary Anne Spier, and join us, too. They have been a huge part of helping us out a lot lately. Stacey and Jessi left because they felt we weren't filling in the blanks correctly, or they didn't have the right people lined up. Luckily Stacey understands that sometimes the right people are the right people for the job, and that sometimes we have to let go of things sometimes, just because we feel better about it.

Mary Anne Spier, who is the secretary of the BSC, seemed a little distracted by Claudia's call. She'd hung up the phone when we answered the phone, and looked down at the envelope Mary Anne was writing. Even though Mary Anne doesn't like to be bothered with the details, I think she's learned from me the importance of being organized. It's not enough to just have this big pile of stuff. You have to have some structure to pull together different things. For example, you need to think up some new organizing idea for the club. Maybe the Baby-sitters Club was once a group that solved a problem. Kristy helped me develop an idea for the Baby-sitters Club, and I'm glad I did it. One day the Baby-sitters Club could exist in a real, lasting, lasting way, and not just at the meetings. Parents could call and set up meetings, and things could change.

The BSC may be old and new, but Kristy is the founder, the leader, and the mom of two great (but little-kid) businesses. One of the things she solves is organized foods, which are usually sugary, made with junk food (vine gas, refined sugar, corn syrup, all that), and made with natural ingredients (not chemical, but plant-derived). No more formula Snickers at the office, no more pretzels.

Kristy is the president of the BSC not only because her idea is huge (it's practically a charter, I think) but also because she is so involved with events in every way. She manages to spread the good news about the BSC all around. Also, she keeps coming up with ideas for the club. For example, the club notebook. That's another of Kristy's ideas; we each write in it every day and stay in touch with what's happening with our clients. We also keep the notebook in order so that we can stay up-to-date on what's happening with our charges. As club secretary I try to keep the most up-to-date information about the kids we sit for organized — and to keep the notebook up-to-date on what's going on with each of our charges.

I'm vice-president of the BSC because we use my room and my phone. I also host our meetings and take over whatever belongs to Claudia. I think that, having had to deal with some kind of overflow crisis (like Kristy), I can see why Kristy is the vice-president: I like being able to deal with people.

Kristy was the first of all us BSC members to have our own phone line. Her mom used to own all kinds of interesting businesses — publishing, clothing lines, jewelry lines, clothes clothes — but now she has a major address (Merrilland Mall, New Jersey). I think Kristy is on the immature side, but I always look forward to her jokes and big ideas.

Mary Anne Spier is our secretary. Although the club was originally her idea, she is the personification of the big ideas. After Dawn Schafer moved away, Mary Anne decided to take her duties in charge. Mary Anne assigns us sitters based on their individual
