 The other was Claudia's little brother, David Michael. Then her father, Watson, had to raise her all by himself. He was overprotective of Claudia's big brothers and sisters.

After Watson died, Mr. Thomas walked out and Claudia spent the next ten years raising her brother Michael. But that wasn't the end of her problems. As we all know, Watson had a lot of problems as well. He cut his hair, grew an eight-year-old sister in California, got divorced, and remarried. Mrs. Thomas had two younger siblings, a younger stepsister, and a divorced mom. (Mary Anne and her husband live in an old farmhouse with a secret passage in it.) Also, after the divorce, Mary Anne and Mr. Thomas moved into Watson's mansion! I don't know how they made any money off of the mansion, but it was a pretty nice place to live while the mansion was being really, really taken over by Watson.

Then there was Jessi, who had the Ramsey family on the move. In part, I'd think she did a good job as an alternate officer because she's such a natural leader. Jessi also gets to be the club's treasurer which has her rich deep inside because she's such a math whiz. Her brother Jeff is an ace student. (See how creative someone like that is?) I think it makes her feel good to be part of such a big family.

Jessi's twin sister, Becca, is an only child. Her real name is Maria, which isn't exactly English, but you would never guess her for making a great-looking name. Her curly blonde hair is usually styled in an old-fashioned style (although she wears her hair in braids lately) with her brown eyes (Jessi usually wears a pair of bright pink stirrup pants instead of a stirrup pants in normal clothes) and her long, silky blonde hair (Jessi often wears a pair of pink stirrup pants instead of an old-fashioned silk sash over her usual raincoats).

And then there were Jessi's twin sister, Anna, who came from an unhappy marriage and then recast herself as Claudia's closet boyfriend. She also happens to be Mary Anne's best friend and a genius who thinks that art is the supreme art. You would not be surprised to learn that she's a winner of Claudia's Art Day competition, a title that she picks up every single year.

One of the things I like best about Jessi is her determination to take charge. She's always coming up with new ideas for improving the club. For example, all of the girls I've talked to think the club should be run with a drawbridge, a fake sign in place of the telephone, and a fake elevator by the way. Guess what. They're right. The main thing that the club should be run from is advertising. We need to spread the word to the children that we sit for that we offer fliers and to children that we stop holding our jobs for non-affiliate groups.

I think it's funny that the BSC, which is mainly run by Kristy, would be a great place to start a baby-sitting business. They're not, unfortunately, a baby-sitting business, but they do advertise lots. In fact, they do so often enough, especially if the job is advertised, on TV, or even at a local inn. Kristy wants to make sure the BSC can serve all our clients well, and we do appreciate that.

The other thing that Kristy wants the BSC to work on is organization. To her, being organized seems like a chore, and I think she's probably a terrible organizer because she's great at it. In fact, no one bothers to ask her what she does, just that she's a great listener and always willing to help us out. Kristy's parents got divorced, and Kristy's dad still lives in the house Kristy used to live in, so he's still very much an important part of the neighborhood. Plus, he's so involved in school that he has to turn down all our extracurricular activities because he's so moved.

Even if Kristy thought that an impossible goal, organizing — even though it sounds impossible — actually appears to be a chore, I don't think it's a chore at all.

Kristy's great at organizing — she's a phenomenal organizer who makes sure we're always well organized. If Mom and I ever find ourselves in trouble, we talk to each other about it. We also talk to each other about what we're going to do. It's a good way to stay calm and come up with suggestions on how we can improve.

Which is one reason Kristy has to inspire me so much. And it is another reason she always inspires me.

Kristy is what you would call a businesswoman. No dependents
