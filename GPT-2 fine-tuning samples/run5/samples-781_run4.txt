brook) and Kristy’s mom. (I’ve already told you why Mrs. Pike is the Pike family's banker.)

Kristy makes all the club members feel good. She loves having new ideas for making things work better. Why not make the club more like the real BSC? She made it work better. One of her ideas was Kid-Kits. The Kid-Kits are little boxes filled with stickers, crayons, and other toys and supplies we take with us on jobs. We don’t bring them on all the time — we take them with us on jobs, for example — but the rest of us find them fun.

Kristy was right about being the loudmouth in the club. But it isn’t that Kristy’s a moron that way. It’s just that she isn’t particularly good at big ideas, and sometimes the club isn’t even organized like a professional business.

In fact, Kristy wasn’t in the BSC at all. It wasn’t until she met and married the great Mary Anne Spier that she realized how wrong she’d been. Kristy was the one who was right. And it has worked out just fine.

Kristy is the best friend I’ve ever known. Even though they look alike, Kristy is the shyest, sweetest person I’ve ever met. She’s also the one who is totally cool.

Kristy’s dad walked out on the family when Kristy was six. This wasn’t because he pulled up in front of Mom’s Factory Hall. It was simply because Kristy’s mom was unhappy with her job.

It seemed like such a small thing to make a tiny thing like that was.<|endoftext|>
It wasn’t as if the afternoon was not going to be kind to Kristy. It was as if it were just getting easier and easier for her. When I think of how much easier it has been for Kristy, I think of the beginning of the end.<|endoftext|>
Kristy finished reading some more science fiction when she was done with Claudia. She watched her parents scoot down the hallway to Claud’s room.

They’d probably need some help figuring things out.

“Hi, Dawn!” said Kristy, bathing Dawn in a dramatic scene. She glanced over at Claudia. “Did you say you’d get to pick up your science book? … Yeah, I see a notebook.” I looked at Kristy. “Oh, Mary Anne.”

“What?” asked Kristy, panting. “You’re upset, you know. Did I?”

“No,” said Kristy sternly.

“Did I?”

Just then Claudia reached behind her pillow and pulled out a huge notebook.

“Do you think I forgot to tell you that we’re going to be seeing this great man next week?” she asked.

“Sure!” Kristy said. Then she began walking down the hall. “Okay, all right.”

“See you Thursday, then!” Claudia rushed out from behind the pillows. Kristy watched her, waiting for her. When she got here, she was wearing every uniform from shirt to pants.

She’d scrounge up the latest book she’d scrounged up the moment she stepped into the room. The one she was looking for, that’s the one.

The book Claudia was looking for was the one her mom has wanted since forever. It’s in the back of her headband. I’m telling you what it is, Mal is dying to get it.

It has to be in a black magic book. It’s in the back of Kristy’s head — along the top. But the book is huge. She cannot stand it and wants to get it out loud and clear.

She’s also got an old horror movie in the back.

I’m glad Kristy’s parents let her get her head straightened. They’re used to getting it done.

Kristy sat forward, her hands on her hips. “Sorry, Dawn,” she said. “I’m not in the movie anymore, though. Okay, okay, okay…. Okay. Okay.”

Claudia picked it up and began studying it.

“Oh, no. Not yet. What about soon? You’ll find out,
