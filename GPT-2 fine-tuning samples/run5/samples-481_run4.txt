======== SAMPLE 1 ========
s. We call her Kristy, and she goes to Stoneybrook Middle School. It’s a small school with only one full time official, but she’s the only black student in the whole school. She has a brother named Buddy, and she’s got seven younger brothers and sisters! So she’s smart and tough around tough people.

Her mom is a real homemaker. That means she keeps a huge supply of supplies and a small supply of clothes (mostly clothes made by the big five outfits). Her stepfather is Watson Brewer, an investment banker who happens to be a millionaire. Kristy’s mom used to live in the mansion, and she and Kristy’s younger brother Charlie used to live with Watson and Abby. Abby is pretty quiet and shy, and Kristy’s mom has an amazing talent for sports.

Now that we’re sure you know all about Kristy’s family life, let me tell you about how it works. The Abby and Kristy family lives in the house Mrs. Thomas acquired when she bought it in seventh grade, so Kristy’s stepfather Charlie Thomas must have figured out something about what was going on at the mansion one day in the 1960’s. He invited Kristy, the BSC’s other best friend, to join. Abby also moved to the house she still had a few years later, after her mom and Charlie had moved out. Abby’s a member of the BSC, so she and Kristy used to choristers. But Mrs. Thomas didn’t want to spend too much time with Abby because she’s petite and long-legged; Abby is petite, and Kristy is short (like me). So Abby and Kristy’s friend Claudia adopted Abby and Kristy’s other little sister, Janine, who are of average height and with brown eyes and brown hair. Claud’s twin, Mimi, is Japanese-American and has a perfect body and a cute sense of style.

The girls used to have a lot of baby-sitting jobs, actually, since Abby’s mom has been trying hard to convince her to leave the house. (Abby is beautiful and sweet and …) but after Abby began shopping around, the house started to seem overrun with kids. That affected everyone’s house. It could mean that Claudia’s new brother, who used to be away on a jujube, became a jerk and Abby moved back to live with her father. It could mean that Abby’s Aunt Cecelia moved out here to join the BSC. It’s possible that the situation affected one member of the BSC.

The problem is that there’s always someone at the meeting to baby-sit for the kids. Sometimes Abby has to baby-sit. But she always works hard to help take care of the kids. And she gets to sit in a lot of jobs sometimes.

Abby is a terrific baby-sitter. No one should have to convince her to go to another school, or anything, other than practice sitting. But Abby knows that she should at least try to work toward an associate member status if any one of the positions is to be filled. That’s why she’s being accepted as a free agent.

Now that you’ve learned a little bit about Abby, you should know how she came to be a member of the BSC. If you’re wondering why Abby was the club’s alternate officer, she was recently accepted to become a full member. That’s right, Jessi and Mallory joined the club, while the last treasurer, Claudia Kishi, joined the club just to take care of the money.

The idea for the BSC came to her one night while watching her mom try to find a job. She decided to form the BSC, and it took some experimenting. (Remember that Jessi has a boyfriend? She’s the club’s other best friend! Who wouldn’t?)

But the idea worked. The club quickly grew to include a really cool set of officers: Shannon Kilbourne, Abby’s twin sister, Anna, and an associate member, Shannon Kilbourne, who never seems to miss a meeting. Abby is outgoing, easy-going, and fun to be with.

There were also some problems that the club wasn’t handling fairly. The treasurer, Dawn Schafer, has a special, deep, dark secret that she keeps. That secret is tied up in some deeper plot, but I promise now that you’ve watched our meeting (I’m the vice-president), it has been very well planned.

First things first: thank you for stopping by our regular meetings. I really like that.<
