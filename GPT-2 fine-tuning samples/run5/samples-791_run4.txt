. B) I “m in awe of Stacey McGill, who’s the world’s best ballet student.”

“I’m in awe of Stacey’s talent in rehearsal,” Kristy was telling us. (Kristy is the perfect club president for two reasons.)

(I don’t believe Kristy says that every meeting. I do.)

Kristy was sitting cross-legged on the bed between us. Mary Anne was reclining on the floor, and Jessi and Mallory were resting their heads in the pillow.

“Look what they made this year at their graduation!” Kristy announced. “You’re going to be an honorary member.”

That was the whole truth of the “graduation” thing, which was hard on me just thinking about it. But I managed to remember to tell it to everyone. “What did you learn last year?”

“You’re going to be an honorary member.”

“Oh, I forgot the honors.” (Kristy is the perfect club president because she has so much good ideas.)

“What about this year?” asked Claudia.

“I’ll have to learn about the White House.” (Claudia has a really awesome memory. She’s always dreamed up events for the White House Kid-Kits.)

“Oh, I guess I don’t know about that.”

“Well, about that,” I said, “you don’t have to. It was just ceremony.”

“So,” interrupted Mary Anne, “did you learn anything about the Civil War?”

That was when the phone rang.

“I’ll get it. It doesn’t begin,” answered a soft voice. A moment later, a male voice, too, as if someone had just called from some strange game or religious ritual. “I’m late, I’m not in too much pain,” he began.

Just in time, the phone rang a second time. “Yes! Yes!”

It was Mary Anne. She took the receiver. “Hello. Baby-sitters Club … yes, this is Mary Anne. Mrs. Barrett had a stroke last summer. She is ninety-nine and very much working toward going on vacation. I thought that was okay for a while, but things were sort of in the casserole. But this afternoon — on this — she was supposed to come back to work. I’m working all the time and I better watch her. She may drive us up the wall in the kitchen.”

That last call came two minutes after what had been Mrs. Barrett’s scheduled starting time. “Jessi and I are free,” she said.

Jessi Ramsey ran to the bed over Abby’s photo. “Thanks,” she said.

Mary Anne sat forward in her director’s chair, gazing at the clock. She looked at the fresh green. “Calm down, everyone. Five-thirty on the clock.”

“Calm down, Abby Stevenson,” Jessi said.

Kristy lifted the alarm. She glanced at the digital clock. “All right. As you can be assured, the BSC is about to get underway.”

“Project Work?” Mallory said.

“Project Work,” Claudia said.

Claudia frowned. “Where did it say ‘Project Work?” From this whole discussion had turned into a game of project how-and-when — and how to tell Dawn how you’d do things, when and how to whom, how to when to when to whom — all the way from Project to Project.”

Kristy swallowed, and she and Mary Anne exchanged a look. “Darn, Claud,” Mary Anne said quickly, “you say’ the time. I say ‘too conservative.’”

“Yeah,” Claudia replied with a shrug. “Too conservative.”

“We can get together again,” Mal volunteered, waving her hand.

Kristy looked as if she were about to drop a brick.

Dawn smiled as she sat forward, her long “sober mouthpiece” gracefully poised between Claudia’s palm and the top of Claudia’s head. “We do get along really well when we do all this well-organized
