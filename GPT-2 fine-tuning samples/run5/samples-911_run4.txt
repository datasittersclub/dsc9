's big sister, she’s the oldest in her family. Plus the two of them live on top floor of her bedroom because she has her own room. Kids wear all kinds of things and everyone likes it. (Mal and I used to live inside her closet, now we get to sit at her desk.)

The BSC secretary is Mary Anne Spier, my best friend and the only one of us who has a steady boyfriend. His name is Logan Bruno (that’s Mary Anne’s boyfriend from last year), and he’s very nice. Logan is really funny, a wonderful draw, and he can talk really quickly. He’s very sensitive, really interested in you and your feelings. I like him. He and I have been friends since before we knew what we really felt: we shared the same blood, we made friends together, we even looked through our dad’s blood in the movies. (We’d have to be glasses-phobe-phobics.)

Now I can tell you that Mary Anne, Claud, Stacey, and I are pretty much guaranteed to win when we’re really excited about something. We love to baby-sit, even though the things haven’t always been easy for us. The story has it that Mom got married again, didn’t she? And then the guy she married didn’t marry her mother? Mr. Spier fell madly in love and divorced her. So she lives alone with her father, except for her two older brothers, Charlie and Sam. Then there’s David Michael. He’s an only child, her mother refused to have him raised on her own. (Heritage Day is here, anyway.) She did get an adopted kid, though.

Mallory Pike and Jessica Ramsey also lived next door to each other and lived most of her life with her mother. But after awhile, Mallory moved to Stoneybrook and joined the BSC.

I’ve told you that Jessi and Mallory were born in the same year — Mallory was two and a half. Then Mal walked out on Jessi and slid into the second row seat and Jessi Ramsey slid into the third.

Being the oldest baby in your family, you naturally have more room to room than that. The BSC keeps two main baby-sitting jobs: Jessi would do any sitting that came her way; Abby would do any homework; and Mallory would do any extra sitting. Mal has three brothers, four sisters, and four cool twin girls, including Tiffany. So she could take almost any job on the BSC.

How can I tell you about the BSC? I can read about the members of the Kid-Kits. The Kid-Kits are boxes we have filled with books, toys, games, and stickers. We add them to the club record book one at a time. Then we decorate our rooms and take down our BSC memorabilia, stickers, and games. We pay dues in cash. The dues are important. We use the money to pay Charlie to drive Kristy to and from meetings, and to fixate on one particular game after another. And once again, it’s up to the club to keep the BSC on top of things.

Our secretary, Mary Anne Spier, answers phone calls at our meetings, and she keeps on most of our club business. She is extremely organized and very precise. Not only in the way she makes sure we keep each other up-to-date about our clients, but in the way she keeps on-the-job information about us, as well. Mary Anne is constantly updating us on how our clients are using the BSC, what’s in it, and how much they pay in cash.

Mary Anne is naturally very good at keeping track of things and we call her when she needs to announce our top BSC appointments. Mal and Jessi have known each other since before they knew each other’d ever see each other. They are each the oldest kids in their families, yet each has a little sister and a brother. Plus, they’re absolute best friends.

They’re also best friends. Each other’s both sweet and quick-tempered. Even when they have a lot in common they can be a handful.

The closest Mary Anne can come to being bossy is Stacey McGill, who is the oldest of eight kids. When she first moved to Stoneybrook (which is eight kids!) Stacey had a very overbearing father. He cut really short when she was in seventh grade, when he just walked out on her family. Then he met my mom and just walked me out. I’ve already told you that Stacey started dressing differently than everyone else in her family, that she has had to move out of her neighborhood
