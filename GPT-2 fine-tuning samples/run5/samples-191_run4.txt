s in California. But, like my dad, he lives in New York City.

“Dawn,” I whispered to Kristy, who was on the phone waiting to speak with the other associate members of our club. “I’ve been speaking to Dawn all afternoon. She says that she’s going to go to a conference with some of our charges tomorrow.”

Kristy grinned at me. “Is there anything else she needs?”

I was right in my spot. I turned on my phone. “We have a new client this day,” I told Kristy with a laugh.

 “Oh, hi” I called Kristy out. I didn’t say hi to her. Instead, I offered her an old, faded, battered movie poster with a caption, “Inspecting the Big Sound Railroad.”

Claudia and Stacey, too, were laughing on the phone.

“You’re serious,” I whispered to Kristy. “I know you’re serious about the Big Sound.”

“Well,” I said, “I thought you said you’d be doing a workshop.<|endoftext|>
“Hello, Baby-Sitters Club,” Kristy replied without saying a word before she turned to call me back. “Kristy’s been a real help to me!”

Kristy was sitting by the door, her long blonde hair, her blue eyes, and her long blonde hair. Her curly dark hair was pulled forward with a long, long stroke, and she was leaning against the wall, staring up at the ceiling.

I knew Kristy was nervous this time and she was, as usual, taking my suggestions. I hoped it would be fun.

“You know all this,” Kristy whispered to me, “I’m going to miss my BSC’s meeting.”

Kristy and Stacey have been together in the BSC for about seven years and share one major thing: They look the way they look. They both have short, black hair (Stacey has long, blonde hair, while Kristy is short), and have a distinct look in them. In fact, you should probably check out Vanessa. Vanessa is Kristy’s friend and the reason she’s in the BSC. She has blonde hair and a big BSC family. Of course, Stacey has been with the BSC since she was a baby and she’s always up for meetings when I’m in the process of doing so.

However, Stacey has also been at meetings a long time. And it has been for a long time, even earlier than the BSC. I mean, I’ve read through our records and it’s obvious we’re all getting along, but Stacey was actually very bossy about my schedule. You should spend some time talking to her.

When Stacey moved her family back to her own house in Palo City, we were looking for a new BSC member who would be available for the night job that afternoon (unless we’d have an emergency, which is probably not the case in Palo City).

Kristy and I decided to turn to Claudia and Stacey, both at our rates, even though Claudia is our alternate officer. She is a natural for the BSC. Claudia’s an associate member, which means she can be anything and join in when we have an emergency: when we don’t have time to baby-sit for our charges; when we don’t have a room available for the kids we take care of; when we don’t have a phone number when we need a sitter for our own jobs.

Since I love to baby-sit, the BSC must be a club in itself!

Stacey and I were sitting as usual, so we had time to talk. But we couldn’t wait to have a baby-sitting meeting to start, right? That was when Kristy called.

“Hey, Claudia, I got a call.”

Just when we were about to get on the phone, we heard a voice say, “We have new clients for tonight.”

There was a quick little sound and we started moving.

Kristy was so cute! “Whoa!” she cried.

The girl was Claudia, a girl only Kristy knows well. (Her real name is Janine!) She has a long, blonde hair and a nice, neat skin and she has curly red hair, too, (the color of ice and the color of death.)
