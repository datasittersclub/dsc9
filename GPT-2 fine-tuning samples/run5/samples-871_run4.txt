, to tell you the story. Here's how it happened.

Kristy and I were sitting in my front yard at about five-thirty. Claudia was starting to sweat. Her long, black, beige-green leggings were swept under the bed and clattered to the floor. Her sneakers were cracked open, under a brim, and over a sweat shirt.

Abby moved to the next floor just as Claud finished dressing. "Hey, Kristy, are you all ready for this? I'm going to knock on your door first."

Ahem. "Stacey, wake up," Stacey urged. "You can't wait."

Claudia nodded and Abby rushed into the room just as Stacey finished dressing. Stacey, who was in a rush to get dressed for her job as the BSC's secretary, jumped out of her bed.

Kristy and I turned to look at Claudia, who was spreading her legs wide open wide open to reveal a pair of open slippers.

"What?" Kristy cried.

"You want to kiss me?" Claudia asked in a dream.

"Whoa!" Kristy mumbled. "I didn't say that was going to be a good idea. Just thinking about how tired everything is makes me really tired."

"All right," Claudia replied. "I'll make you an offer."

We both went upstairs to our own rooms. Stacey picked up her mitt, which was wrapped in a cozy white blanket. She lay down on the bed next to Kristy. "What are you thinking of me offering?" she asked.

"I'd like to help you with some of these," Kristy replied. "My brothers and sister are in the process of adopting a child. They're wonderful, but they're so young and so unfamiliar with these kinds of things."

"You're not old enough to think of things as they are," Claudia pleaded.

"Of course not," Stacey replied. "You older!"

It was then that we began to talk. For hours, we spoke about the various projects Kristy and I have been doing. We'd worked on Claudia's sleeve, thinking about how she and Anna and everyone else in the BSC was trying to be "more grown-up." We were having a BSC meeting, after all.

"Hey, guys," Kristy finally said, "have you been reading the BSC's other big fliers? There's going to be a BSC flier this week! It says: 'Become a Baby-sitters Club, Kristy, join Anna, Ethan, and Byron!'" Kristy was lying on the bed, holding her hair to her head with the same feeling she had when she first found this flier. Anna had joined the BSC when she was six, and Byron hadn't. When he was seven, Kristy's dad remarried — to a nice married guy named Watson Brewer — and Kristy's mom found a new stepmother for their family.

That's how the BSC works. A person signs up to become a new family member every Monday, and that person takes the job, making sure to provide a steady supply of baby-sitters for the coming weeks and months. Kristy (being a leader) really coach the BSC on everything from baby-sitting to phone banking.

Kristy and I are lucky to have Kristy, the coach, and Dawn, the sitter. We're best friends, and even though we sound a bit alike, in every way — we are both quick to speak up and quick to speak down — we have a lot in common. The similarities end there. Dawn is quiet and sensitive. She's the most romantic character in The Amazing Spider-Man. Also, she has two younger sisters, Tiffany and Maria, so her parents work for the Brewers, who also happen to be in Stoneybrook.

Dawn has long, curly red hair, blue eyes, and a passion for animals. She's also an independent spirit. She cries easily. Dawn's dad died in a car accident when she was nine years old — not long after Dawn's older brother Jeff. (After the accident, Dawn and Mary Anne's mom adopted Emily Michelle, a two-year-old puppy.) You can practically hear the tears rolling down her face as she cries.

Dawn is our alternate officer. She fills in for any officer who isn't able to make it to a meeting. I'd nominate her for the Honor Roll.

Just in a very big moment, last week, Dawn showed up at her brother's house to see if anyone was free. Not long after that, she did. Mary Anne and I were astride Dawn and her family. Boy, was that show-day. There, stuck up among the muck, was Dawn. She was
