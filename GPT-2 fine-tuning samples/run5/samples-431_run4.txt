, he knows it’s true," says Jessica Ramsey, who coaches a softball team for little kids. “All I could say is ‘Good night everybody,’ ’and good night to all.”

“Good night everybody,’ she says. “Bye!”

At the barber's, we started the meeting to ourselves. As I have said, everybody had one last stop at our table. Jessica had been crying. Kristy had gotten really emotional. Claudia had been crying too. And everyone else had fallen into a daze and a dweeze.

Kristy hadn’t just turned from one face to the other, he had turned from some other person. That’s the one word I think is absolutely perfect for the job of secretary of the BSC. She keeps us organized, puts our schedules in order, and keeps it up to date. She’s very organized, and her very commitment to being the keeper of the BSC record book and all of her club record book — including the club notebook, in which we each write up every sitting job we go on — makes her a dynamite. If I were running the club, I would have to be — wait for it — a lot of fun and make it do some good things for the club. A lot of nervousness and a feeling of duty to keep the record book up-to-date.

But I do what Kristy does best, and with good reason. I grew up in Connecticut, and I know it’s really hard on my mother. It was only in seventh grade that I befriended Mary Anne and her dad, who had moved across country after her parents refused to see their daughter. (Well, we did get a good kiss today.) After the move, Mary Anne became friends with Emily Michelle, a Vietnamese toddler whom Kristy and I knew very well, and which then, when they were teenagers, became an instant best friend.

After my parents got back together, Mary Anne mentioned that she and Kristy had been invited to join the BSC again, but when they first showed up, they seemed overwhelmed.

After a while, they said no. They knew they needed more officers, and they figured they’d have another member soon, but no one could take everyone on. So it was finally a deal brokered — Kristy and Mary Anne would join the BSC.

“Here I am, taking over!” exclaimed Dawn. “I’ll run the business, Kristy, you and me!”

“That’s great, huh?” said Mallory. “I really appreciate taking the job.”

I laughed, and they both cracked up. If anyone had ever made that dream come true, it’s me. I’m a big, mean nut, and I like being around people who can’t take someone like me on. Not that I’m dumb, mind. One day I’m just bored. The next I’ll be a rock star. I might even start my own company.

My dad did start the company, though, and we all have jobs to do for him. But he likes me, and his new-found love of sports, sports “business,” he said decisively. “I really like you guys, but I still have a ways to go. I mean, it isn’t all sunshine and rain and rainbows or snow on the face of the Earth because there are still plenty of rainy days, and you and I are still at your service, Mary Anne.”

After the conversation about my parents, the phone rang.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club,” said Kristy. “Hi, you guys!” Then, just as she finished talking to Kristy and her three brothers, Mary Anne snatched the digital record book from her desk and began pulling out schedules and phone numbers. As if she was remembering correctly, she checked the book, saw that the job was about to start, and called Kristy’s number.

Soon, there was a crash and the phone rang — and I was sobs of fright. I had to stop and think. How did I do it? I turned around to look when the phone rang.<|endoftext|>
“Hi! Baby-sitters Club!” The only one in the BSC who isn’t Mary Anne Spier rings. The club’s great idea, really. The BSC was formed to provide baby-sitters with a steady pair of best friends who can get the job done. It was a great idea, and Mary Anne has to admit she did a terrific job of it. She and I are totally on
