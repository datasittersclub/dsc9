======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 born’s soccer club. I was looking forward to seeing Abby and Mallory after Abby got out of her temporary foster family, and Mallory had just taken Abby’s BSC class about dating and dating and the Babes’ family. She was really feeling a little lonely.

“Oh,” said Abby. “You and Jessi are the only two of us to have a home.<|endoftext|>
"Buddy," Claudia Kishi told him and a man sitting at her desk were seated beside her.

"Um, no!" said Claudia. "The other three boys are in my room."

Jessi, the other two, and I sit for our club at our meetings, too. Jessi and I are junior officers, and our parents — our Aunt Ceylon, for a second — know me better than we know anyone else. So that means it’s easy for us to talk to each other.

I don’t even know if Jessi knows me (although, believe it or not, I have a BSC record book). I can sit in the same chair the other officers were sitting, though. It’s kind of neat. Jessi and I are our junior officers because we both have to be under two years old: Jessi, who’s a tomboy, is the oldest, and I, who is the youngest. We have different talents, since Jessi has a mind of her own … and I have a special talent for making friends (as well as making them feel welcome).

Since I am our secretary, I have to keep track of all our schedules. I have to be up-to-date on what’s going on with the club members, as well as keep up-to-date on our club activities. While I am on hand, I have a phone call with each member so that parents and sitters know to whom to call.

Here’s how the record book works. I have two associates, Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne, who live in my room. They are our temporary sitters, so they can take jobs when they become available, while I have to give the job to the other associate. Sometimes they don’t come to meetings, but we do keep track of how they are doing. Sometimes we get asked questions about our jobs. We even keep track of who’s available for jobs, which is a good thing because it stops the club from being a complete wreck.

After we have been clubbing for a while, we line up our sitting spots and call them up. We call the jobs to eleven numbers. If no one is available for a job, or if someone gets stuck, there’s usually someone else to call. But they’ll always be there, so no one knows we’re having problems. We call a call back to tell everyone who has been seated what the job is.

Then the meetings are over — except that Kristy, who is our secretary, is at the door, reading a newspaper or advertising her Kid-Kits. Then Jessi and I write in our club notebook. With the notebook — the journal when we’re at meetings — we take responsibility for writing the jobs.

When we’re finished writing the books, Kristy gives us a signed letter of recommendation, and we have to fill out a few official club jobs. That’s because we do a lot of writing in the notebook — covering names, addresses, pictures of our charges, information about our jobs and special events. The notebook is a good starting point for having rules and scheduling for all the jobs.

Some of our meetings are also very busy; in the last couple of weeks we had a fight over what to do in the kitchen with the leftover pasta. But Kristy seems to have more fun than anyone else in our club.

Kristy is funny and charming. She’s very self-assured, with brown hair and brown eyes. Her mom died a long time ago, and her family is full of people who missed her. Kristy is from a small town, but she is very close with everyone in the family.

Kristy is very smart, though not very athletic. She’s not in the least bit diabetic, and she does have trouble controlling her weight. She still wears glasses because she has to. Kristy’s parents’ house is right across the street from Claudia’s, so she can get around by herself.

Kristy isn’t always creative with her materials, and she doesn’t always try to be perfect. She has to dress great, always have a really good look, and always be on time. If it’s raining, she won’t have to do a lot of outfits. She wants to show off
