s. You know, as I said, I've had a stroke, too." She gazed at Stacey. Then she said, "So what if Stacey's going to be older? I can't expect to be there for her. And I couldn't tell you until after the induction, so I had to ask Stacey's parents. And I guess we'll never know for Stacey's parents."

Stacey's our treasurer, but before she could ask her parents to give her more money, Claudia asked everyone else to join in. That, in turn, prompted our two junior officers, Mallory Pike and Jessica Ramsey, to join. But the rest of us were busy, and so were Kristy and Stacey. Stacey made her first ever BSC Pay Day gift: a notebook. (It was hard to make up for some friends forgetting to mention that I’m eleven and in the spine group — no wonder Kristy has such a hard time with it.) She’d drawn a picture of each of us, then explained how we’d collected the money and spent it helping Claudia with her art. This made me think of Mallory, who’s really good at math, and worried. I helped her make one of the big bucks.

When that happened, it was easy for me to pick up a new passion for art. I’m not exactly a student at SMS, although my grades have not improved so much since seventh grade. Instead, I dabble in a handful of Art Mode classes on Mondays and Wednesdays. My goal in life — to be the BSC’s alternate officer, which meant I was able to take over the duties for fallen regular members — was achieved.

My great ambition was realized, too, but I still feel as if I’d failed miserably if I’d been less than stellar at everything else. I decided that I’d better go back to drawing, which would have been more challenging if I hadn’t fallen behind. (I guess that’s where the BSC all wrong with me.) That summer I had finished Out of This World, The Last Supper (a romantic comedy I was going to tell you about), and four chapters in A Wrinkle in Time. Then I had finished One Big Dance, Chapter Three, with ChastityMary, Chapter Six, with Mal and Daddy, with Jessi. Then I had read a comic named Shakespeare by Robert E. Howard called The Great Gilly Whore. And then I had gotten into a career as a writer and illustrator at school, with the help of Mrs. Thomas, at first but soon after that. I always looked forward to after-school activities. And I finally decided that I’d finish One Dance with the Rodowskis and go to college. My grades have improved but I don’t think I have a future in ballet. Maybe I’ll get one someday. And I could go to ballet for fun. (I’m still serious)

One last thing about me — my friends. As I mentioned, I’ve started to learn how to make the best of my mediocre school year. At first I was sort of disappointed. Except that I was still learning and I wasn’t mad at my teacher. She was right. But you know what? I’m still not happy with what I’m doing. I just feel like everything I’ve done (or not done) has prompted people to want to see me get better. Right? Well, not exactly. Parents like kids who they can trust to see things from their own perspective. They like kids who like to see things from one's own perspective. Right? Wrong. I think that when you’ve had a baby, and you understand that not everybody’s life is perfect, you tend to see life from one perspective — right through your own mother and father. Right through your own birth mother and father. Right through your own brothers and sisters and sisters. Right through the beginning of summer — just to the north, past all the ice and snow and the dogs. Right up to the spring — before the trees have even fallen. Right through the summer after school — before the sun has set. But right through to the fall. Right through through to the beginning of spring. Right through to summer. Right through to your next best friend (or, more precisely, your stepsister)? Right now, Emily Michelle is the only one of us who actually knows what’s going on in school. She attends an all-girl, all-day school and she’s doing extremely well these days. (Besides being the only member of the BSC to have a steady boyfriend, I’m the only other BSC member who actually likes what she sees.) We also hold tons of junior BSC meetings. That’s why, when
