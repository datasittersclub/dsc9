======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 was a good thing that David Michael was in Stoneybrook, because he was pretty busy at that time, and the reason he missed his brother was that Mom and Charlie hated each other in the beginning. But then Charlie, who was two at that time, grew closer to David Michael, and David Michael was really happy.<|endoftext|>
It's about time to talk about the BSC in more detail. I'll start with a few thoughts.

The BSC is one of three major baby-sitting outfits in existence. Each of us is a member of the other. Which is great, since we're all great baby-sitters. It's nice to be part of something bigger. The other two are â€¦ my dad (who was the father in my other case) and my mom.

My dad and I are exactly the same. My mother is a pretty advanced stage (not only in her science but also in her art), while Dad is a really nice guy. He grew up in New York City but grew out of his own home in Stoneybrook. He was originally from Stoneybrook but his dad moved back to Manhattan for good while we were at it. Anyway, my dad was really nice to me and I really wanted to be his friend. I had no idea it would become such a big thing all the time. But now I know for sure. No one but me, ever in my life has been a more special, special kind of person. I was privileged to have a sister two months ago and to have a brother ten years ago. Mom and Watson (one of my favorite baby-sitters, remember?) have been really supportive about being sisters since she met Watson. They also adopted a Vietnamese girl who is now in high school. She is a real, live genius and I know full well that the whole world is going to adore her. But I would have a lot of fun if I were to marry Watson and have her with me forever.

Speaking of my new best friend, I must say that my sister had something special to be there for me and my family. That is, she was always looking after herself. She'd been going through a very tough time since Watson left, when she lost her mom. She had to struggle a lot with her younger sister Dawn, and she'd also needed a steady boyfriend for her to be able to do this.

Here was a girl who was always having problems and not being treated just as she had been. Her life had been pretty normal since that time. First of all, it was normal for her mom to marry Watson, after all! Then it was even okay for Dawn to come back to Connecticut. Mr. and Mrs. Brewer had been supportive of everything she went through, and now Dawn looked as happy and healthy as she could without him. It was all good. I can never forget that moment when Mom and Watson were all so friendly. The Brewer divorce was one of the happiest times of Watson and Karen, our two oldest kids. It was also the beginning of the end for Dawn, and for Mary Anne, our honorary member.

Well, today it looked like Dawn had had something to look forward to since her parents got divorced one day. She looked at her digital clock and was about to dance to It's a Wonderful Life during a dance rehearsal. She pulled her hair back to reveal a bright yellow bikini (it had been a white one), and she ran her finger down Mrs. Spier's blonde-blonde hair in a circle.

I was about to leave the BSC when I heard the phone ring. It was the last call of the day as the meeting was almost over and the phone was ringing almost as often as not.

Mom checked the numbers of the five children and told her we were leaving Mrs. Schafer alone with David Michael. Then she called Mom and told him we were leaving Mrs. Schafer alone with Karen, Dawn, and Andrew. But when the meeting was over, I could tell my friends in the club were moving slowly. (Which was especially true since all that time Mrs. Schafer had been with each of us.)

Maybe that was because I hadn't thought about the BSC for quite a while. After all, it's a group of dedicated baby-sitters who really care about their own well-being.

I was so busy thinking about my friends and the BSC that I couldn't think of anything else. It was a busy day for most of it except for driving. Which may be why I'm the club secretary. Mary Anne loves to drive, and I love to drive. (Actually, Mary Anne used to be the only one who could take me to meetings, since she always had to drive all the time anyway.) Mary Ann has to obey the rules when she drives because the rules are different for every car. I've been driving your favorite sports car for years, the Terrible Tow Truck. And you know
