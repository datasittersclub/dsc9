 there. She had spent the last year moving across town to the southern end of town. Her parents thought she might be older or taller than Logan's when she moved over to Long Island (one mom had said that Logan and her father had dated, she couldn't believe it).

She was already moving to New York City from California. When she finally found an apartment in NYC, she wanted to live there with her family for some time, but she needed a job soon so she went to Stoneybrook Community College. At first it took her a little getting used to, but now she's happy to stay.

Kristy takes her classes very much to heart and really works hard to keep up as much as possible. As secretary of the BSC, she keeps track of how many members' jobs she's on, with an added record book that makes it easy to write up clients we don't know.

"I think we'll be able to replace her if I go away, or we all move, you know," Kristy told me last week, as the conversation turned to a case with a new client coming up.

"Yeah!" exclaimed Claud.

"The client with the problem?" I asked.

"Oh, hello, Claud!" exclaimed Mal.

When she walked over she opened the case and showed me, grinning, and said, "The client with the problem has moved back to Long Island. I have a business meeting tomorrow afternoon, but there's lots of people out there who need to be home before that happens."

That made me laugh a little.

I called Kristy up over the phone. "Hello, baby," I said.

"Hi, Claud, and I'm just glad you're here, aren't you?"

"Yes, baby," she answered. "I have a job to call tomorrow afternoon and I'm sure they'll all be there. They'd love to hear what you need. We don't have the whole job in New York, do we?"

"Mmm. And who knows, probably that afternoon."

I looked around at Claud's room. I wasn't sure she could find the place that day. "Hey, you all just got a new girlfriend and family, too," I said.

"Hi, Claud," replied Mal. "I can come back to your place."

"That will," I replied. “I can call you back later." We were sitting on the floor and Claudia hopped up on the bed. "Come on in, let's try to get some rest."

"Thanks," said Mal cheerfully.

"Let's go," I suggested.

"That's good!" said Mal excitedly. She took a deep breath, and then she ran out. “I'll let you know when you're home," she said. She made a small speech before she left.

“Good, I'll be back in a minute." “Thank you," said Mal, running for her car and pulling into her driveway.

“How did you know?” asked Vanessa, her voice soft and dry, and almost wistful.

“Well, I guess I was in the right house in Mal's neighborhood when I saw her take a few last phone calls from New York and then get word of the new girlfriend.”

“Oh, great!” said Mal. There really was no need to explain, just give a good reason for the call, and the phone rang a second time.

Well, Kristy made the call well. ’Hi,” she said happily as she crossed the street toward Claudia's house. “Hey, Claud,” Claudia hung up. “Can I call you after tomorrow?”

"Nah, you're not available," complained Kristy. “Thanks for calling, but I don't think I can call you back.”

“Oh, good,” said Nannie. “I'm so glad you're here right after tomorrow.”

“Thanks,” said Claud; and we all waited an instant.

“Well, I mean, I think the appointment was good,” said Nannie. “What are you? You're the treasurer.”

“I'm the treasurer!” Claud replied. “What could have been better?”

“The treasurer is a real job.”

I stood up from my seat to take my seat back.

“A real job!”

We all started to chant "We all need a job!"

“It's a job,” said Kristy with a snappy smile.

“Oh? I'm sure it is!” a
