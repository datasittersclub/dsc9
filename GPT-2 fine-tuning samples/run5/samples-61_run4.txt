 thing was on, and I thought we'd catch up. I was looking at the clock, but we didn't seem to notice any difference.

Mom! Oh, come on, it's a little late, Mom. It's early!

Our phone was ringing, and I knew she wouldn't be able to reach us, nor would her brother Michael, who needed a baby-sitter. It was just so late, and I couldn't imagine that I was making a huge mistake.

"Yay! Yay!" Kristy said. "It's the last time we're going to the hospital!"

"That's fine!" said Sharon, pulling a small bag out of her purse. "We'll get you all checked out by tomorrow evening."

"So, Mary Anne!" said Karen, clutching her twin brother Logan. "My name is Bruno, and I live on Long Island, so you better believe that I'm going to see you, too. I'm sure you'll get a little older at some point."

"Yeah, sure," said Kristy, looking relieved. "I think I can give you my phone number tomorrow afternoon, and then you can call any of my friends and your parents and ask them to call you back, too. I need to check in. Maybe we can call it in. We've got two more callers I need to see." (Karen wasn't there, but she should be, as long as she's there.)

"I'll call you back then!" Dawn cried. "I need a ride home for your two little brothers who are getting older. My father will be too sick to let you ride, and I'll be free to call you back."

I sighed, and rolled my eyes at Kristy's offer, too.

Dawn called me back, too. "Hi, Mama!" she said. "Shall you call me back and we can call you back? That'll only take a moment, I guess."

"Sure," I replied. I told her it wasn't enough talk, so I would have to be quiet with an important baby-sitter. (That way, Mom wouldn't have to worry too much about calling me back.)

"Can't be easy," I said in a whisper from the other end of the room. "I've missed you twice. And I miss you more. But I've had so much to think about that day. No-one is going to tell me I can't stay home, at least not right away. And I also mean no-one."

‘No-one” said, with an expression that sounded almost like a crinkle. It was as if she knew it, and she could tell you everything she had to say.

‘No-one. No-one. No-name mother.”

‘No-one.”

‘Nooooo. Not my,” said Sharon, sitting up straight.

‘You miss me, yes, but at least I will always be there for you. Now, please, call your friends and tell them to call my friends and tell them I'll call up a lot of new people. It could be a great thing when I was older, and Mom has been waiting me the whole week.

Dawn, meanwhile, called back again, and got a thumbs up. ‘Okay."

‘Yay!”

“Yeah.”

We got her attention, and she called back Bruno again, and we decided that calling up a lot of new people didn't hurt. Baby-sitters Club members, as we put it, are special people who are able to call a job during the week during which they feel like home. The Club takes out lots of dues and other charges, and members love giving back. That is, if you're on time, which is especially true when you live in one of the city's gorgeous neighborhoods and can't drive to and from your parent's. You have to be up there on the job if you would like to make it on time so you can get another plate of food to eat on time!

And I just started my BSC days; the rest I'll do in about a week.

‘The BSC’s baby-sitters club!” I called back.

‘I need a little help.”

As the phone rang in the room, Kristy looked out through the window, looking at the BSC and meeting of the Daydream Club, which she organized. She had invited the other day Mallory Pike, our club member and our club vice-president, to join. Stacey, who lived a few blocks away, had come too.

The other day we saw each other, and that day we hung
