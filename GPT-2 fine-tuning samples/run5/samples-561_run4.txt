 the club record book and I’m going to start doing that with the first job I get to fill out the club record book!

I think a lot of parents can identify with me. They know that I dress in little-girl clothes — and that I wear pink tights, sparkly nail polish earrings, and wild jewelry. When they see those things, they instantly think of the Kishis — and they absolutely adore me. They’re the best kind of parents … And they’re the ones who get the word up front so they know what the situation is.

“I’m going to be leaving this meeting,” I told them quickly. “Since you asked,” I pointed to their desk and then to the phone. “Here’s the address.”

“Hi,” Claudia said. “Are we at the Kishis’?”

“Yeah,” I replied happily. “This is the house we rented.”

You should know that the Kishis live here in Kristy’s neighborhood. The BSC and I have been friends since we were in diapers, during the days that Sharon Schafer used to live across the street from me. Sharon is absolutely fabulous, and she’s sooooo cute — she’s Japanese, with long, silky black hair and these velvety pinkish-brown eyes. One of the things we’re especially into is the Kid-Kits, which are boxes filled with cool old toys, coloring books, and things we baby-sit for. Kids love them, too. My dad always keeps the Kid Kits filled with stickers and crayons, which he sometimes makes himself, and other things, such as stickers and sticker books. Kristy thinks my Kid-Kits are her artistic talent, though. She and I are very sensitive, but a little loud, a lot outgoing, and not much interested in clothes, aside from the occasional outfit like a tank top and jeans.

“Hi, Claudia,” I said shyly from the other end of Claudia’s desk. “Come on in. We’re just starting this month, so sitters need time to clean up.”

Claudia glanced at the clock. “Three-thirty …”

“I have a report about a trip that Kristy and Mary Anne had on Wednesday night — so it’s a no-show — but I’ll check it out later.”

I glanced at the clock. “Five-thirty …” and then I glanced at the clock, too. “Six …”

“Mary Anne!” I cried. “What’s the difference?”

“You call that … a no-saying, Mary Anne?”

“Sure,” I replied. “I call the club. Are you sure?”

Mary Anne smiled at me. “Fine. Now call Kristy the president and she’ll take charge.”

“Oh, by the way,” I replied. “Let me ask you this —”

“What’s the difference between Thursday and Friday? Thursday’s at five—no one minds. Why don’t we call it Thursday?”

“Oh, I guess,” I replied, pretending to be taken aback. “I thought Thursday was five-thirty. Let’s change it up and call Friday at five-thirty.”

We made such an arrangement that we needed extra time to clean up. Our club meeting ended shortly after four. Our meetings are always held in Claudia’s bedroom. Her parents are strict about privacy and don’t let us (well, not yet let us let us get away with letting us make private phone calls) take out baby-sitters on sitting jobs.

Before I go into that, let me tell you a bit more about what my friends and I are and how we got here. First of all, this is my third year as president of the club, and I’m the only one in the club who has a steady job. So, I get to run things without me, or anyone else but Jessi and Mal. It makes for a nice group of people, even though they’re really nice people.

Jessi is the club’s other African-American, just like me, club president. I was shocked by how few jobs she had, but I still are. Jessi has chocolate-brown skin, is short (in front of the eyes) and with her brown
