======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Thomas's house, which is decorated with art pieces from the '60s, '70s, and '80s.

For one thing, Dawn lives on the other side of town where my BSC is located. That's because her father, who died suddenly in the first year of high school when Dawn was in sixth grade, moved here. His parents wanted a better life for their son. I'm one of them.

It must have been the hardest time for my Dad to convince me that he was the right person to take over the duties. (I admit it. I made a big mistake by trying to be responsible.)

Another reason is that my Dad was the one who took me to meetings at Dawn's. That's because he's a big talker (he's the most important talker in my family), one of whom hates being left off the record. (He's the only one who wants that.) Dawn's new boyfriend, Logan Bruno, is a terrific talker. He doesn't get along with Dawn; she hates him. But it's not just Dawn who hates him. She's been the one who has had a tough time lately.

There are two other reasons for me to like our club more than mine. One is that we use the club treasury more than other clients do. The other is that (unless you count dues) the members pay a little extra each month for meals and gas money during office hours.

The other reason for us to like Dawn is that she's just one of the handful of BSC members with an IQ above the state average of 5. The problem with the math is that it's hard to understand a BSC meeting, especially one as complicated as Claudia's. She's the only member with the intellectual and artistic ability to write a great, sophisticated book.

And the BSC is more than just a business. Like the rest of the BSC, it's a true success story to this day. Mr. and Mrs. Spier both live here on BSC property. I would not be surprised at all if the Spiers had become real pets. (Claudia, on the other hand, lives and works for a company called Baby-sitters Club and she and her siblings are full-time regular clients.)

The only problem is that the Spiers seem to have two minds: One in particular and one in a complicated and complicated business. The other in the club. It's complicated because she wants to be a writer of children's books and a best-selling author of children's books (she's been nominated for three BSC awards so far, including the BSC's best-seller list) and a math whiz (she's the first author of a children's books collection to open). The BSC is organized so that Claudia and I come to meetings all the time. (Claudia is the only member who comes to each meeting and is always available to answer a question.) We also use the treasury to cover transportation and books for the Kid-Kickers who go to other meetings.

Claudia's story will take you for another five minutes.

If you read along, you can imagine how little I would have to do without her. Now my brain must be the hardest and I can read it as easily as the next person. What a little love of children I have. I love reading Dawn and Emily Dickinson, but my brain doesn't like books and I don't like them much. For a while I felt a lot like Claudia. And so now I'm addicted to the BSCâ€”to reading, writing, and illustrating.

I love children's books; they're my favorite medium (as a matter of fact, they're my absolute favorites!) but I hate writing about children, because I know it's totally gross. That's why I've decided, at the end of my first meeting of the meeting, to get my brain out of my room.

One of the big reasons I started Baby-sitting for the BSC is because I like kids well enough to keep a notebook (with pictures and a pencil and a pen, so the notebook can be in my room when I'm not at the BSC). I love writing and illustrating and would totally like to keep one. (I do my best to keep it in the BSC, though, and you can see the notebook here.)

I think that if you don't read the entries in every child's notebook you won't like the information. There are also some entries that are very short. (We all dream that we'll write down a book for our children) If I have to write, I usually concentrate on the last few pages. (In all that time, I'd probably write a description of a mountain in one hand and a mountain in the other, a description of a mountain in another hand. I'd write a description of a mountain in the other hand, but it was a pretty
