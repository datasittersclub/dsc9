======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Ramsey is one of my biggest fans. Nowadays she’s a full-fledged member of the club — and she used to come to every meeting.

Claudia’s not exactly a sophisticated dresser, of course. She has a pretty face and big dark eyes (she’s Japanese-American with reddish-brown hair, and she carries herself like a dancer). But Claudia is a stunning artist and you can tell she’s in some ways artistic. She draws, she paints, she sculpts, she writes. Her style reflects her personal style: school but also her work. Claudia loves art and always will: she’s an excellent student and an excellent artist. Her grades in school are excellent (it’s a good thing she’s smart, so it doesn’t bother her) but her grades in the art department (that’s where the great teachers at school like to test their grades) are mediocre. You see, Claudia is the only member of the club who does all the baby-sitting she does because she is an artist who wants to do better stuff and wants to do it well. In other ways, Claudia is like Stacey McGill, the genius genius of the club.

No one likes to admit that Stacey McGill is not only an art genius (and a student of Kishi Art Academy in Stamford, which is in Stoneybrook’s trendy (thank goodness).) but she is also a fashion model. It’s funny: Stacey has long blonde hair and sparkling blue eyes as well as big brown eyes and no relation to the rest of us. She is a very talented musician and takes classes twice a week (if she’s able). But these days she doesn’t have any extra practice in the gym or on the football field. She likes to take up ballet (she had to have her back arched at one point in seventh grade) and does a lot of aerobic activity during the pre-surge period. I think that in some ways, she looks even better in her ballet and sculpt classes.

Claudia’s best friend is Stacey. But not only does Stacey live with her family, but with her two brothers, Sam and Charlie, whom Stacey’s dad fell in love with not long ago. And Stacey became very close to them after her move. When her dad married a woman named Janine Schafer, just before she turned thirteen, things fell into a chaos. First she met and married a guy named Robert, who happened to be an associate member of the BSC. But it turned out that Mrs. Schafer was originally from Stoneybrook, and her father had brought her here because her mother had divorced and her father had remarried. So Mrs. Schafer got over this tough experience and became pretty close to her former boyfriend, Robert Brewster. Then she and Claudia and her dad, when they realized they needed more sitters, moved into Stoneybrook’s huge, old farmhouse. (Claudia doesn’t need a big mansion anymore, despite the fact that she and Robert now share a room, a gym, and two-thirty electricity.)

So Stacey, who had moved with her family to a mansion next door to Dawn and Anna (and she isn’t shy about sharing valentines with her dusky friends), moved into this old barn on the other side of town. (It’s haunted. For years, Stacey and her mom and twin sister, Emily, tried to keep everything to ourselves.) Now it’s all over and everyone seems to be at their best: happy vacations to Disney World, summer vacations, health foods for Toddlers’ (I never eat junk food; I just know it’s better for my health).

Now to the second baby in the family: Kristy. She’s our club treasurer and we use her money to pay for new items at our supermarkets and for events for our Kid-Kits. (She makes sure we have plenty of Kid-Kits. Kid-Kit is one of them.) The items are not only new items for the kids, but they are also new to the kids’ families. Kristy and Claudia recently discovered some old collectibles in the old barn. So we need to find a brand-new set. Kid-Kits are boxes we have filled with our old puzzles, crayons, and markers. The kids love them — so much that we decorated them with our old toys and games. The ones who get them think they’re great gifts. And sometimes Kristy’s Krushers … a team coached by some old kids. (Kristy’s team is called the Baby-sitters Club. They play Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon sports, but the BSC is run by Kristy
