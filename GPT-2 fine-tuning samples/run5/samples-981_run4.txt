!) I have an old, faded dresser that my mom brought me if we were going to sit in Washington Park — really old stuff — and it had a ball. It looked nice — very classy. In fact, I had thought of putting it together on my own. But when Mom called me a baby for posing for the camera, instead of a kid, I became an adult once more.

The Baby-sitters Club and I are very close, even though some things in our names are actually us and one person, not a lot of people know about us (Mary Anne, for instance, is the club secretary, and so are my other best friends, friend number one and two).

I know I'm not the only one in our club having some really stupid luck. Maybe we're on our own now. In fact, we're so close, that no one except Mom or I can do anything about it. Even the most experienced baby-sitter in the club has to learn toiling by accident. That's what happened to us at first.

We began the club like any other. First we had to advertise. We always spread the word about the club to our closest friends and family. That was fine, until one day Mom needed a sitter for David Michael, who was having trouble with her dad. Who needed a sitter? There was nothing we could do, and Mom had to make four phone calls to our regular clients to find one.

The rest is history, my theory going. For a brief moment, the Baby-sitters Club was in business. But then, as always, things took a crazy, crazy turn.

At one point, Mom needed a steady sitter, and the Baby-sitters Club was in trouble. We started going after a rival, this mob boss named Winona Ryder, who was a rich kid from New York. She began making plans for a baby-sitting party, and my theory is that somehow she and the other men in the club got themselves together and devised the Kid-Kits. They included things like the boxes, the markers, the stickers, even paper shopping bags — all this good stuff.

One of the Kid-Kits was actually Winona's, a Lost Laundry that she and her family recently built in her room. It's a big box that has a lot of hidden contents: a detailed description of every drop of urine that a baby-sitter has to give up, a map of the city so that the kids can easily find their way there, and a fun game where the kids can come up with their own play experiences.

As my mom explained the Kid-Kits to us (which is always wonderful), it was clear she was thinking of everything. Including Kid-Kit stuff. The only thing she didn't mention is that her oldest brother was involved in a car accident when he wasn't there helping Mrs. Winslow anymore.

My mom would make such a list of charges and misses that she'd make it sound as though she were responsible for everything. It didn't surprise me, though, that she was so concerned about breaking in her room. We never mentioned that to her father before. He's a nice guy, and a good guy in general. You see, he's back from a month or so gone by now. He had shown up to the meeting for an interview, and you already knew that. So, while Mrs. Winslow was making phone calls, her daughter, Becca, was collecting dues. (Mr. and Mrs. Winslow didn't see each other often and had to rely on each other to keep the BSC running smoothly.)

In a very interesting way, Mrs. Winslow and Mr. Brewer are like twin sisters. They grew up together, and they stayed close. That's because Becca is only going strong because her dad got him to do it. That has nothing to do with Becca's sister, Janine, who is a true independent. Her family is big: Her mom, Becca, and her younger brother, Jeff, grew up with all these different families, but they have become so complicated that they needed each other to deal with growing up. Eventually, Becca's father just walked out after just a little while. That left Mr. and Mrs. Winslow to take care of Becca and her brothers.

It was a complicated thing to do, but the Brewer-Watson family came to Stoneybrook not long after the other club members had grown up and had started families again. They realized that having a parent at home was important, especially for a baby-sitting job. So they played matchmaker, and the rest is history. We live in the most integrated neighborhood in Stoneybrook, even though we're all different and different in some ways (like that Becca I pictured was me and her little sister, Nannie, who are our little sister and own my
