 a mansion.” (I mean, her parents are divorced!)

I tried to keep up a smile but I just couldn’t. I heard footsteps. I heard a knock at the door. It wasn’t Stacey anymore. Her face was covered with a blackness that looked like a cloud.

Claudia shook her head. “Uh, I heard something,” she said slowly, her mouth full. “Augh. I don’t know who.”

“This is Stacey McGill,” Abby said. “Abby's home from a meeting, and I’m supposed to come, so it’s only about five-thirty.”

“That’s fair, of course,” said Stacey. A smile spread across her face as she shook Abby’s hand, but it also formed a tiny bubble of bubbles as she turned back to Abby.

“What’s going on?” I cried, trying to figure out how to collect my thoughts.

Stacey gave me a reassuring smile. “I’ve been trying to think of a way to be with you for a while.”

“I’m trying?” I said softly.

“Abby’s home,” Abby reported softly. “The meeting should still be beginning.”

It was almost five-thirty. And here I thought I was going to run out of breath, but I almost got to my feet.<|endoftext|>
“No!” cried Kristy Thomas from the bedside.

“She was right!” me and my friends got up from the floor, and pulled ourselves up for the night. It was very nice of Kristy to do that.

“This meeting will come to order!” said Kristy.<|endoftext|>
Kristy Thomas has been taking the bus for a long time, since Jan Brewer left. (She doesn’t approve of Kristy.) She’s going through a phase where her mind is too full of activities and too busy with her friends to notice. (Kristy’s so dedicated to her job that she doesn’t have much time to do anything other than stare at the clock.)

I can’t believe this.

The last few chapters of The Wizard of Oz are all about Oz, which is why I’ve decided to keep it short. But it must be one of the great things about Kristy. She’s never let her feelings matter.

“This is a big deal,” Kristy told me. “It’s going to be the biggest news of all week.”

“This’s going to be your worst nightmare,” Claudia said grimly.

“I know,” Kristy replied coldly. “As you know — your entire house is going to be under the spell …”

Might as well be.

“What are you afraid of?” I asked.

Claudia shrugged. “Zak Frost, your house is going to be affected so much that no one can work,” she said firmly.

“It’s nothing,” I said. “I can’t believe it.”

“You’re lucky you’re lucky.” Claudia said reassuringly.

The only things Kristy’s house is going to be totally devastated for are the pets — Tigger, Tigger’s ears, Tigger’s pack of ghost stories. She’s convinced there’s even a million of them around here.

“I wouldn’t believe it!” Mallory Pike said.

Rrrry, I spat.

Claudia and I were sitting here and watching her house go up in flames. We’d love to have our eyes shut as the flames tore through the house. We’d be crying at the mouth!

One more thing you should know about Kristy! She’s a tomboy. Like I said, she’s a tomboy. She loves to have lots of fun.

Let me give you an example of a boy who’s a genius: Ahem — you’re right. A boy named Bart Taylor, Jr. has a big mouth and is a terrific athlete. He’s a baseball fan. He could run a baseball team.

Claudia’s brother Charlie is a professional baller. He can recite Beowulf
