 love. She loves to read, to write. And as if that weren't enough, there's no doubt that she also hates boys. Her older sister, Janine, used to date her brother, and he never dated again. Then she met Watson, who has grown to like Janine pretty much as much as Janine does. Anyway, Janine isn’t interested in boys anymore. It’s just that she likes to read and write. She’s always trying out her new book, which she keeps on hand.

Kristy isn’t the only one with a brain, either. She’s the only one with a big family. She took over the old BSC job that was taken by Dawn. That’s when her younger brother, Jeff, moved back to California. This time, Kristy’s father left the BSC and took the job of returning father. That’s where all of our associate members come in. They take jobs that fall somewhere in between the two of them.

Now, you know how I said we were the best in the world. Well, not the world, really. That being said, Kristy has lots of friends. She’s the only one in the club who doesn’t live on Long Island, which was the original place where the club was formed. Actually, Kristy has two other families from her old neighborhood (her dad has died in a car accident when she was nine) — one of which is a Vietnamese girl, the other of which is an actual genius named Watson Brewer. Kristy is totally gorgeous, with jet-black hair and almond-shaped eyes. So naturally beautiful that you could wear you shirt in the style of a high-schooler you saw around town.

Kristy used to be so intimidated by her family. Her parents had practically caved in when Kristy’s younger brother, David Michael, moved back to California with his dad. Kristy had to fight to keep her family together. At one point, she and her dad had to fight to get a job.

Now that you know the details, let me tell you about Kristy.

Kristy, who is African-American, started out as a baby. She grew up mostly in Stoneybrook, but then her life changed — and it didn’t always go according to plan. First, when her father was transferred back to New York from Stoneybrook, she met Dawn Schafer, Mary Anne’s boyfriend. They became close, and they soon became friends, too. Now they live in the Schafers’ new neighborhood. They don’t baby-sit at night anymore, though. So their neighbors got married again and, in all that time, they have two children together — Karen (who is now an eight-year-old girl), and Andrew (a boy from one of the youngest homes in Bradford). That’s good for the Schafers, but bad for Kristy.

It was hard for Kristy back then because she had grown up in Stoneybrook. But now she’s better integrated. She’s got more contacts than most of the rest of us, and people who love Stoneybrook are friends with her.

Another great thing about Kristy is her mom. They’ve known each other since they were nine. (Remember when I told you how Kristy and I grew up together? Well, Kristy and I are the oldest of the six kids our club adopted.) Plus, Dawn and Andrew are two of Kristy’s other best friends, Kristy Thomas and Abby Stevenson. Kristy also has an older sister and a baby brother, plus a Aunt Cecelia. And as we mentioned, Jessi is the club’s other best friend.

“I got a hint of what’s going on in a few minutes,” said Kristy. “I saw you and my dad talking about buying a million pairs of jeans tonight at a department store and seeing as you can tell, they didn’t wear enough—if they didn’t want to —to replace those on the street. Anyway, I thought, how does Mrs. Schafer get her money? Like, I’d like to buy a million pairs of jeans while I’m waiting for the department stores to open. Let’s see. I can get twenty pairs of jeans for forty-five cents. That’s about the price you pay for two pairs of jeans.”

“Good idea,” said Mary Anne.

“Oh, well. Do you have something else to tell us about yourself, Mary Anne?”

“Uh, this is Kristy. It’s the first of the summer, so this month Kristy’s
