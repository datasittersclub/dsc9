 a kind of dorky personality. He doesn't like kids, but you know it when I tell you. That is because, while I don’t look sixteen or anything, my dad doesn’t look sixteen either. I think he should be embarrassed for putting such a great idea out there. Mr. Stevenson is married to Rachelley Stevenson, a terrific-looking thirteen-year-old ballet dancer who lives in my neighborhood. (She was the one who, three months ago, gave birth to a wonderful baby boy named Andrew.)

Our newest member is Abby, who lives in Kristy’s new neighborhood. They have a kitten named Tiggy, and two goldfish, and a rat, and about two birds, and two fish, and a crab.

Now when I call Claudia’s mom, you can tell right away because Claudia is the most adorable thing that ever happened to her family. (Although the rest of us soon realized how lucky we were…. I wonder how many kids her mom could lead. The Kinesior kids!) Abby is one of eight triplets the Kinesior can adopt, and she’s so smart. She got an A in high school (her older sister, Janine, is another triplet), and she’s good at math and spelling and she comes from a big family. So there’s not much left of an ordinary household!

Abby lives alone with her mom and her twin sister, Anna, and their mom and dad. (Neither of them speaks French, and neither is a good speller.) While her family is processing Abby’s new twin sister, Anna, Abby is busy with Eleanor and the Stevensons.

She likes math, reading, writing, and health food, which is why she is our club treasurer. She keeps a stash of dues money for us club dues, which we use to pay Claudia for her phone bill and to cook and clean our pizza. We pay for our phone and, when needed, we buy supplies for our Kid-Kits.

If you can imagine a Kid-Kit, or a project where we replace things that are missing or dirty, or if someone has allergies or other medical problems, tell us what it is. We can make sure the stuff stays in the bags. We’re pretty glad we do that, because we help our clients solve their problems.

That would be Stacey Stevenson, our club secretary. She keeps track of all our schedules, and she knows our clients’ allergies and medical conditions so well that they wouldn’t be surprised if something was a no go.

Stacey’s the only person I know who would permit me to carry a concealed weapon, since I live on Bradford Court and along your block.

(If you’re wondering what Stacey does, here goes.)

As BSC (Boy, Are We Great!) club secretary, I would make the most of Abby’s neat little job. I have the most important job.

In case you forgot, our associate member, Logan Bruno, is also a regular member. He and Abby rarely meet each other, but they are good sitters. We call on them when we need more sitters. They take late-night jobs when the staff can’t keep count. We use them.

My friend Shannon Kilbourne is another friend of Kristy’s who I was going to tell you about. (She’s a math whiz, remember? And she has curly blonde hair to die for.) She’s about the same size as me, so we try to push her into things. When she’s away, we schedule other jobs around. Shannon has reddish-brown hair, long, straight brown-blonde hair, and freckly blue eyes. Sometimes she talks at the slightest bit sad, but I like to be patient. I have to admit that though we’re both pretty sophisticated looking, I have to be treated to some pretty awful stares from the club members. They don’t even know me.

If you haven’t already guessed, Shannon is a vegetarian. I mean, she hates the meat, but that doesn’t stop me from being super-proud to be a vegetarian. And I, on the other hand, am a pretty good vegetarian myself. In fact, I like eating something healthy. But she doesn’t have to eat very much. You can always find some of her snacks in another room. I think they’re particularly nice snacks.

Speaking of snacks, Shannon’s mom is the ultimate boss. She has two little brains (one in charge, one in the bedroom) and three personalities (really bossy). Shannon’s one of a kind, and she knows how to make a good present for you. Her cookies and popcorn are
