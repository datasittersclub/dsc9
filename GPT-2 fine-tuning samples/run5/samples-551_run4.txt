ases and allergies and things. (Her mom is strict about what’s on the menu; Jessi says it’s no big deal.)

You have to realize that Jessi is the only black baby-sitter in the club. Mal and Jessi do a pretty good job of it — at least, that’s what we like to call them. Mal loves to read, and when she visits her father she likes to read Nancy Drew books. Jessi also loves to read Nancy Drew books.

But what happens when Kristy and Dawn and Marnie and Claudia and everybody else get together? Well, we learn a little more about Mal (she’s reading a Nancy Drew novel) and Jessi (her boyfriend, Stacey McGill) when the club meetings are over, but I believe Mal and Jessi would understand that my prejudice toward them is partly responsible for the prejudice against them.

In particular, the prejudice against Mal and Jessi. Mal is African-American, and we’re pretty sure. We like our skin lightened, dark skin so much that we want our hair to be lightened and dyed a certain shade more often than we’d like our eyes to be so dark. (That leaves lighted, shiny skin, since it’s used for sport. Plus it’s not healthy for you to look shiny in the sun.)

Anyway, when Mal and Jessi became parents and married, and we got a good job at a new company in Stamford, we decided to figure out a way to help Mal and Jessi while we were in the city. We asked Mal and Jessi’s mom to become club officers (they’d been jobs, anyway), and they said yes. Well, not very well, since their father’s company transferred him back to New York, and by then some bad (but necessary) split appeared in Stamford and Mal had to leave them. So Jessi and Mal headed west again — to California.

Well, not for long. Not long ago, Stacey left the BSC, which is important. I hope she doesn’t ruin Mal’s life. I’m sure her father’s job is tougher than mine. For now Stacey is an associate member of the club. That means she doesn’t come to meetings, but I understand that she’s used to being in a special environment. That means she can’t jump into a baby-sitting job unless she’s totally booked.

What other responsibilities do we have for Mal and Jessi? Well, Stacey can’t baby-sit alone, although Mary Anne can sit on the floor. Stacey handles both jobs very, very professionally.

Meanwhile, Kristy is sitting in Mary Anne’s bed, her visor on her head, reading a science book. Kristy is always experimenting with her looks — she’s dressed in jeans, sneakers, a turtleneck, a sweater over a turtleneck. She’s got a style that’s very cool, even if it’s a little on the big side. She’s thin — almost too thin — and she wears her brown hair usually shoulder to shoulder. (She also has brown eyes and brown skin.) Even though I don’t like Kristy too much, I can see that her sense of style is much more sophisticated than Mal’s.

Kristy looks like a movie star like her in real life. She has long brown hair, creamy white skin, and big blue eyes. She comes from a huge, large, chaotic family. Her father is an executive editor for a big publishing company in New York. Her mom hardly ever visits the stores anymore, and now she’s working with the McGills to bring supplies to their overflow baby-sitting projects. Then her younger brother Sam was born. And when that happened, Kristy’s father left the family. No wonder Kristy has trouble with him all these years. She grew up on Long Island. Nowadays she lives in a style much more organized than Kristy’s. If I were to list all the things Kristy has changed, I’d be in the middle of a column. For instance, those extra thick red eyes on Claud’s brown hair, the habit of fixing it every day with mascara and pencils and stuff. Or her father’s job, which he’d gone into overprotective over the last year. I mean, you’ve probably already done that. Now I’ll add Claudia, Claud’s best friend, who had a very helpful, casual lunch at Claudia’s until she moved back to New York. Claudia is Kristy’s junk food lover (believe me, I adore her Chez R
