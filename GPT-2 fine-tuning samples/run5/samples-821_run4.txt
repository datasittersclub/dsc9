 do and make the job even more fun.

How do I top my best friend Jessi, who's my best friend? I pride myself on my organizational skills. She's the only member who doesn't hesitate to do what's right. (Personally, I'd kill for someone with those organizational skills, but I bet they don't.) Jessi's the only person in my club who goes to a private school. She's the only club member who wears a uniform — jumpers, tights, pullovers, whatever. Jessi's also the only member with a steady boyfriend. (If she did, I'd have to check with her to see if she had one on, but not today.) We don't pick up on the extra machoness by looking at her looks alone. Jessi is a serious, extra-serious dresser. She puts together the most stunning outfits in her closet. She claims to have divided the BSC gym bags from cupcakes.

Jessi and I look awfully alike. Both of us are on the smaller, more fashionable block of what are, by now, nearly thirteen grades. We're also best friends. We'd be wild for each other, too, since both of us are pretty short. But Jessi and I are much more like Mal — more worldly and pretty young. We're also somewhat of a shock to the other. We're not sure yet what kind of a person Jessi is. Maybe she's a tomboy who dances the violin. Or she could come from Europe and dance en pointe. We don't see much of either of them often, though, because their families and houses are very different.

Mal, on the other hand, is a naturalized U.S. citizen. That's because she was born in New Jersey. Her parents, however, thought the state would be too difficult for her. They decided it would be easier if she lived with her grandparents, though. Mal's family has three younger brothers and sisters, including a set of identical triplets. They live in Mal's neighborhood every other weekend and another with her aunt. Their house is across the street from ours.

Jessi and I are also pretty different. For one thing, we're both small and we're enormously impatient. We're always frustrated when we're not in school (I'm not, though). But it doesn't matter. We sit there, trying to do what's assigned. (If I'm absentminded, I'll run around with scissors.)

Mal's problem is not her parents' disapproval — it's that she's black. It's just that she grew up in a mostly white town in southern California, and you never hear about it. You might hear about it from one of your parents saying, "She didn't do anything wrong." That situation is just not true.

Anyway, if nothing is doing Mal's soul a favor, she lives a pretty normal life. She uses most of her room for entertaining. During her lifetime she has access to all kinds of interesting, creative, and unexpected treats. The first of these was food: a chocolate cupcake, a pretzel, a fudge-daddy bar, a chocolate-covered chocolates trifle. Mal acquired all these things when her dad couldn't find any. She doesn't remember him, but it must have made her sad.

By the time she was in seventh grade, her mother died. That was not a happy ending. Mrs. Schafer would have been terribly sad, but she listened to her daughter and devoted herself entirely to her job. I should say that at the time, Mrs. Schafer was much happier being a mother. I mean, she was rich and had taken care of her father, but her passion was art. She really understood the pain. I don't know why, though. That passion is what keeps the BSC together.

Mal doesn't let that sour attitude or high-pitched laughter slow her down.

We have a new member right now, Logan. I told you I was getting impatient!<|endoftext|>
“I’m sorry, your route looks like a map — Bart, England, just like the French do,” Kristy was telling Mary Anne. “And I couldn’t do it right now.”

“Oooh, great!” I said, pulling out a map. “Isn’t there something there somewhere? Do you know what it is?”

“It is almost impossible to reach,” Mary Anne said, rolling her eyes. “There’s a high road just outside Stoneybrook. Just outside of school. It’s only a half hour walk from my house.”

“I love it,” I said. “I really do.”

“It must be hard
