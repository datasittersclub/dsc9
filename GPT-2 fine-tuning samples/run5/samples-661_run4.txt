 top. What do I call her? “Watson’s daughter?” Jessi’s best friend, Mallory Pike, started to ask. “You’re talking nonsense.”

“Well, this is the truth,” said Jessi. “Somebody has gone there alone and all the children in my family think they’re crazy.”

“What?” asked Stacey McGill. “Who did it, or who did?”

“Who did it?” asked Claudia Kishi, smiling. She and Claudia are the same people who founded the Baby-sitters Club. Claudia’s more of an intellectual. She’s easygoing and doesn’t care much about anything, other than what’s happening with the families who are fighting over the “everyday bread’ (that’s what my great-grandfather was saying). In fact, the members of the SMS were probably in aaron musser’s store at the time, in the sixteenies.

“Yeah,” I said. “But aren’t they the most brilliant kids in the school history book?”

“Is that all you and Mary Anne and all your brothers and sisters are saying?”

“Yeah,” I said. “You’re talking about girls. Like Dawn and my brother Todd. They’re in eighth grade.”

“How did you know?”

“Yup,” I said. “All I’ve ever said is that the bus driver is a genius. He always knows things by looking at diagrams. He’s in seventh grade like all the rest of us!”

“Hey!” called Mal.

We turned away. Jessi had a flash of brilliance and ran off running. (Maybe that’s because she’s such a character. She has to hide her brilliant braces.) We weren’t interested.

“Dawn?” asked Mal. “Did you spot me?” In the hall, Jessi was propped against the wall, her hands covered with a tissue. “Hmmm?”

“No!” said Mal. “What’s that? A cell phone? I don’t want my dad to let me dial any numbers.”

“What’s that mean?” I demanded. That’s right. As our club president, I wanted to make sure that no one would ever get e-mail or rent or go to a movie with my mom or anything. Also, I wanted to tell you that I wouldn’t touch any of the club members’ food unless it was part of my honor society or something.”

“No!” shouted Jessi. (Remember Jessi’s mom? She used to be the head librarian at Stoneybrook Middle School, and she still does!)

“That’s total lying,” I said.

“Tell me about your school, Mary Anne,” said Mal.

I did. I knew about Mary Anne. The secretary of the school’s Honor Society.

Mary Anne’s great-aunt was also on her bed. It was Dawn’s idea to take one look at her mother and see how pale she was. All over Mary Anne’s room she’d make a model of yourself with leg warmers and glittering earrings.

But not for Dawn. She was all confused. Dawn was dressed in her usual attire: a bicoastal-print casual turtleneck, a white shirt, and a white, high-top cropped top. From ear to toe she wore a black chiffon top with pearl-studded earrings. On the outside appearance, she looked a little like a deer with her black hair, chocolate-colored skin, and thick black hair.

What a way to look at Dawn! How pretty she was! Dawn looked like a deer with her hair, for sure. But Dawn had clothes and everything!

Dawn was elected president of the BSC because the club was her idea, which she went on to complete later. Dawn has two older brothers, Jeff and Sam. She grew up in Stoneybrook, but she was pulled into the neighborhood because her dad used to raid the house and kill her brothers. When Jeff died, Mary Anne became a long-distance parent to him. Then she and Dawn became stepsisters. Dawn even went out to dinner with Jeff and Sam. Dawn gave her lots of publicity, which I
