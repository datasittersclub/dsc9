The phone rang three more times. “Hello, Baby-sitters Club.”<|endoftext|>
As I walked into Claudia Kishi’s bedroom one afternoon one year ago, I was still in the process of studying for a grade. The last piece of homework I had on was in the sixth grade, so I was still a total mess. My thoughts were with Claudia and to be honest with you, I was very sorry for her. I was the only one at that meeting who was sure that the rest of the club members would understand how badly I felt. That’s because Claudia is so brilliant. She’s such an individualist. She keeps herself organized, she talks in sentences like a real teacher, and she doesn’t let anyone down. I think she’s the only one who has a clue how a person can be successful, whether it’s her work after school, working as a secretary in a publishing house or as treasurer of a big, successful record-keeping club, or how she’s always listening to clients call at her convenience (she even manages to get to meet one every other week).

We meet in Claudia’s room every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon from five-thirty to six at four-thirty. It isn’t a big deal to some girls, but the fact that we have to be late for class (no one minds that, but I never hear about it) and to take pictures (that’s probably a bad thing for the club, though my friends don’t think it’s a good idea) proves it. At least, that was my idea. It worked.

Every week, Dawn gets to sit in for Stacey McGill, Mary Anne Spier, and Claudia Kishi. Then everyone else is free to take a seat. I was the only one free.

If you haven’t guessed, Dawn’s the BSC treasurer. Dawn’s always late and keeps track of how much we have saved, so we don’t have to worry about it. If a friend of the club asked us to contribute, I wouldn’t hesitate. It shows how dedicated I am about the club.

I think the best way to tell you about me is to tell you about my best friend, Mary Anne Spier. I’ll start with Dawn because her real name is Erika. (Don’t worry, I’ll be quiet.)

Dawn had to make her first donation in memory of Stacey, since she’s our treasurer and he’s our secretary. It was amazing to me that Dawn didn’t hesitate. For instance, she gave us our first dollar. Now when I think of it, that’s kind of special. (Plus, I don’t think I have ever made a dollar, but I do think it’s a lot. You know, I don’t have enough to go around.)

We didn’t have to spend any more money on Claud’s phone. Dawn paid for the phone and the expenses for Charlie, Kristy Thomas, and Sam. It was a total of “MUST SEE” (Mallory) dollars. Dawn’s the only one of us who doesn’t live here.

Before Dawn left, Kristy was sitting at the same table with Mary Anne. Then she said, “Let’s start with Dawn.” “Let’s begin with Mary Anne, before we decide where she’s going.”

Dawn is Mary Anne’s other best friend, because they really are close. In fact, Mary Anne and Dawn are best friends with the least amount of differences in people. Mary Anne likes to talk about clothes, schoolwork, and how much she’s getting paid and the amount of junk food she’s hiding. (Dawn is crazy about Richard Drew books.) Dawn also likes to talk about music, whether it’s her music, or her mother’s music, plus whether or not she is good at sports. (I like to write up all of Mary Anne’s sports games for Dawn!)

Mary Anne’s best friend is Jessi. They’re best friends. They’re both eleven. (Just kidding, of course.) We’re both in sixth grade at our old high school, Stoneybrook Middle School. Mary Anne and Claud really like each other. Mary Anne has the happiest touch, like Jessi, but Claud has the darkest hair. (She’s also a terrific baby-sitter.)
