 clock. I think she looks pretty cool.

Kristy giggled and put her foot down. "Hi, it's me, Mary Anne. I'd just like to make sure our class is ready for tomorrow."

"Well, I could wait, of course," said Claud, rolling her eyes. Her class wasn't very useful before the phone rang and we received a call that night from Mrs. Weiter who said her husband was needed for tomorrow's meeting.

"Mrs. Weiter," I said.

"She needs someone to take care of his homework," the man said. "I know someone."

At that moment, something in the situation hit me. I wasn't sure what Mrs. Weiter had said. I didn't need to look. It wasn't the kind of question that would interest me. I wasn't sure what she meant by "someone." Was it me, or was she saying, "Mrs. Weiter needs to know" exactly what I was looking for? I realized that was something I would want to ask Mr. Weiter â€” for a minute.

"Oh, I see," I whispered, nodding in his direction. "We'll do our homework tomorrow, after school and until you call in."

Mr. & Mrs. Weiter looked at each others eyes. "Do they?" asked Kristy.

I nodded.

"Then do they have to go to your house tomorrow tomorrow?" asked the man.

"Uh-huh," I said.

"Sure," insisted the mother. "But we'll find someone to take care of his homework."

We waited until the next phone call turned tohute to begin our meeting. We didn't get to tell Mrs. Weiter about the homework. We still didn't have any information about why Mr. Weiter was so worried about her. But Kristy had the phone in hand, and we knew she would be quick.

"I'll find out," I said, looking at Kristy as we went down to the main stairwell.

With a look of disgust, all the windows in the sixth-floor window that Kristy had been staring at hung open. I dropped my flashlight on top of the floorboards, aimed at the ceiling, and set my flashlight directly in front of Claudia and Mary Anne. None of us could hear her scream, but we all guessed how loud it was.<|endoftext|>
"Are you ready, Stacey?" I repeated my own name after sitting down next to Kristy. "You're ready now!"

My voice was full of confidence.

"What?" Kristy mumbled to herself.

"I need the phone back," I said as I peered down at the receiver in the kitchen.

Kristy looked as if she might have a needle in a haystack.

"Come on, everybody, I need your help." Kristy turned to Stacey. "And I need a back up now."

"And I need Stacey's phone number," Kristy continued, "I need your help now. I'll check it tomorrow."

Stacey pulled a bag of crisps out of her purse and looked thoughtful. "Stacey is here."

"She's a baby," I told her. I had a good idea how thoughtful Stacey was.

"Then do you think I'd be better off holding her phone in my hand, if I could just get one of our other clients over and help? If I could just call Stacey and tell her where to call, I wouldn't even think, 'Oh, Mrs. Ramsey, you've been extremely picky about Stacey. But if I could do it to Stacey, I'd definitely do it to Stacey. She's still a baby. I don't want her to be in such a hurry."

Stacey looked as if she might have a needle in a haystack. "But you're not making it all about Stacey. You're making it all about one person, Stacey, and I want you to be ready as soon as you get her."

"All right, Stacey will be. See? That's what you're talking about."

"Not until I get my phone back, Stacey," I said, smiling, "I want you to be prepared for this phone call."

Stacey said she was ready until the next call came in. She hung up.

"You've already told us Stacey is going to be in New York, are you all set to schedule her, or are the entire group a group?"

"We're both set," I replied. "And we both know how busy New York City is. But we're all just making this call anyway to make sure we can reach Stacey."

Kristy looked at Kristy.
