 after it got to her. When it was over, she hugged Kristy and whispered, "I love you and I want that phone number back."

Kristy is an artist, and one of my artistic talents, although she's an associate member of the Stoneybrook Creative School — it's not that she's not talented, it's that she always manages to bring out the best in her subjects.

Kristy loves books — especially those in the style of the classics. But for kids, books have not come naturally to her. She was raised as the only black child in a poor neighborhood. In the late sixties, a real sense of independence was taking over. She moved to a new neighborhood, in Stoneybrook. She still lives in the Stoneybrook neighborhood now.

Kristy is Vietnamese. Her accent seems to make her out to be more outgoing and quiet than the others. So she takes classes in a Vietnamese accent. Her parents and I have been very close for so long that we'll never forget what a true Vietnamese lover she was.

“What’s this? I’m sorry,” Kristy said with a smile.

Mary Anne's eyes widened. “What’s going on?”

“I just asked you. What’s happening?” said Claudia, looking at Claudia. “It’s about time.”

“Yeah,” said Anna. “I'm scared.”

Kristy, sitting in the kitchen, was thinking about Kristy. “I’m sorry,” she said, putting her hands over her ears and staring out the window.

“Don’t you know how hard it is?” asked a voice in the kitchen. “I mean,”

“What’s that?” murmured Kristy.

Kristy doesn’t know.

I sat across the kitchen from Claudia. I knew right away she was worried. But I wanted to see the baby before I ran out into one of the shops.

Stacey, who had arrived two minutes earlier, entered the room. She took the baby in her arms, kissed Kristy on the cheek and said, “Baby-sitting, Baby-sitter, is Kristy Watson. He doesn’t look like me at all.”

“I know,” said Kristy seriously. “I’d know about it, too.”

“Not my baby-sitter,” muttered Stacey. “No. I didn’t know what I was’st talking about back then.”

“But,” suggested Stacey, “that’s true.”

“I’m glad she discovered it. But,” continued Kristy, “it’s hard for me to handle.”

“Not so hard for Kristy,” murmured Shannon, “but hard for me.”

“Well,” muttered Shannon.

Kristy was not looking as serious as I had hoped. She looked at me as if I were a puppy in her ears. “I can handle it,” she said, giving Kristy another hug. We were still in the room, watching a movie, listening to a new book. I was in the living room. “Maybe I should sit down. I want to watch the new movie,” she finally told me. I didn’t groan that hard, but I think Kristy is a very nice person, if not a true puppy.

I knew Stacey’s room was a big problem. I had to hide my fears. I was in the basement. The stairs led to Kristy’s bedroom. (As I always tell stories about my first boyfriend, John, and my first baby-sitter — you know, Mary Anne of Orange. Mary Anne, Kristy’s mom, and Kristy’s stepfather, Jeff, had just moved into the house with Jeff, who was my brother and sister.) I was not supposed to enter Stacey’s room. Even though my room was under the bed, Kristy’s room was under the fridge. I knew that the place should have a new fridge, and I was supposed to hide the refrigerator, too. But I was scared.

Kristy had always had a boyfriend. That was it. She was pretty open-minded, maybe even open-minded about her own life. That just scared Kristy. And then Kristy’s boyfriend left.

Kristy’s boyfriend is Sam. He was a kid from
