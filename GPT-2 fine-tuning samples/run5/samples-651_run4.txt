 right at nine. So I had been going back and forth between my old home in New York and Palo City all week.

I hated it. Was it because I like things the way they are? No way,” I muttered.

“Well, what about Palo,” said Kristy. “Your house is out back in Palo City?”

“Yeah. My father’s going to move back to New York soon.” I was hoping the move wouldn’t be a divorce, but it wasn’t. When that happened, my father became so moved that he nearly lost his mind. He went to California to stay. And when I did, he left me in his old house. It was a total ruin.

“What a shame …” he said, looking around the room at the house and everyone he was leaving behind. “If I had lived in your house, you’d never have abandoned us. Even if you’d grown up and realized Dad didn’t love us, you’d have lived through this to the last time you saw us.”

“Wow!” I said weakly. “So sad.”

Kristy shook her head. “He’s not even dating my father. He’s not even dating my mother. He didn’t even date my stepsiblings, his own father. Not to mention my mother and my sisters.”

“Mom’s parents got divorced, and I lived with my mom, and I lived across the street from Claudia and Nicky …” I was trying to process what was going on. I couldn’t help it. I’d been feeling sort of sad and lonely all week; even better, the house we were going to stay in was being taken over by another parent. Now Mr. and Mrs. Kishi had decided to start a new household. And I’m so sad that my little brother is being controlled. He’s getting his first taste of hand-washing — by accident. I’ve never stopped to think about it.

“Well, my dad’s going to be back in New York next month,” we said breathlessly.

“Whoa!” cried Mary Anne.

“Oh!” I shrieked. “Oh! Great!”

Kristy rolled her eyes. “Claudia, you’re the only one who’d wanted him back.” (Kristy’s parents got divorced two years ago.) “They’re going to get divorced soon, too. And I’m not joking. I’ll get it. I’m not kidding.”

“You have to keep quiet, Claudia —”

“Yes, I’ll speak up if you want to be heard.”

“Okay.” (Kristy spoke in a calm, adult voice.) Then she shook her head. “No, my dad never wanted me to go back to New York. He wanted me to live here in the house across the street from Claudia’s by your house.” She turned away from the room. “Oh — okay. Let’s move.”

“My dad was really worried about my moving back to New York. Well, he wanted to stay here permanently, of course, but he was really scared when his wife got divorced. So the Kishi got him back together with their mom — and he’s going to be here permanently until something happens for the next few years.”

“I hope it’s going to be permanent,” said Kristy dryly.

“But —” spoke a quieter voice. “Am I really out of sorts? Are all the people in New York strange?”

“Oh, I guess so. People who live on different blocks are different,” I said, glancing at each other. “But I guess all New York is like this beautiful zoo where the animals are so different, and you have to be careful what you eat. And I guess that just wasn’t the case in England when my dad was here. There was a war going on in the 1700s against time, and it was ending badly. The Americans won,” she went on,”but England was still a happy land just a long time later.” (People in that country died soon after Kristy and I came to NYC.)

The house where we’d stayed was definitely a zoo, definitely a zoo. Actually, there was more to it than
