“Oh. My. God!” said Claudia, laughing. It was the sad, sad truth.<|endoftext|>
I'm very glad to be a member of the club, since it’s been one of my favorite things about coming to Stoneybrook. I’m glad to be part of the club because we’re successful and the neighborhood is better than it was a year ago. That is, at least, so far.

Before we move on, I want to point out a little detail for what “organizational unit” means. I’ll start with it.

First of all, we have a club.

The club is a pretty big idea. For the past four years, we’ve been on the business end, like Stoneybrook’s biggest business. (Clothing and food are our other huge business.) We don’t advertise, and we don’t have official club meetings, but our members have to be very, very careful about what they eat, especially if they’re new or if they have allergies or other special food habits. When we call Claudia right before we go on a job or at a service we’ve ordered, a lot of people say "oh, there’s a dog restaurant!" or "what’s it like? I’m totally turned off, if you want to know." But a lot of times, the people who do the booking say, "Oh, well, we can call you back soon if it’s just supper and dancing. And don’t worry, we’ll call you right back if none of that happens." That’s not always the case. Sometimes clients won’t even let us know that Kristy was a vegetarian before we offered her our food. Which is great. And we can wait for the restaurant to open again. But it takes more planning and patience than that. It’s a great job.

One other thing about the club. We maintain a record book, complete with our addresses and phone numbers and schedules, plus a good supply of necessary client information (such as names, addresses and children’s names, plus information about our clients’ history, such as the usual list of charges’). The record book was one of the ideas of Shannon, and it’s very important (okay, maybe even necessary) and necessary because it records details about the clients, especially their families. (For example, if someone has a problem with a person who might not be able to work, the record book would show up and help out.)

If I were a little kid, I’d have a very nice family now. (Well, not my own, of course, even though the person might call me the Junk Bucket.) But if I become a great parent, I’m in no better shape than I was a year ago. And that's really what makes us successful. We know that, in order to survive, we have to get out of our old ways and start over. Like Shannon, we think we can be pretty special but we also love people — like Shannon, I don’t think we get that.

For example, on Mondays or Wednesdays, I bring a pizza. There’s nothing wrong with pizza and having fun with it — it’s all the same. It’s not my usual thing to bring a pizza anyway, but we have to be creative with filling and different from the usual, and I think that sometimes the differences in taste just don’t hold up.

Next to me are Abby Thomas (whom you’ve already met), Jessica Ramsey, and Mallory Pike. They’re our junior officers, and they’re both responsible for “regular” (assignments) and “high performance” (challenge) jobs. For instance, they’re BSC officers, not junior officers. In terms of style, they look alike — short with a straight face and brown hair. They’re both pretty short. I guess we don’t have our own style, either, because their parents aren’t exactly the same. They used to be a couple of guys, but a few years ago their father decided he couldn’t take anymore kids and died.

“Oh, well. Well, fine. Now I’ll have a job to prove I can do it.” Abby was leaning over her desk, looking at her digital clock. “Monday afternoon, eight o’clock. My appointment will come around at five-thirty. Okay? Okay. Good. And then it will be five-thirty on the clock.”
