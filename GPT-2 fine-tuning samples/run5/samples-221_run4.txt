 with the other students, but I wasn't going to let myself let off a quick breath. What if Mrs. Pike hadn't been here that Friday?

She could've been a neighbor of mine. She lives part-time with her family and goes to college. She has a brother named Charlie who lives with them.

My neighbor, Claud, is our first-grade student, one of the original members of the BSC. (She and my brother are also our officers. But you see, our other officers are in a different class, and our regular clients don't attend meetings. We also have to check in with a lot of extra dues money that Claud raises each week. We also have to pay some of our dues and then attend the meetings.) Claud works (mostly as secretary) as hard as I do. The last few months in particular have been challenging. But I've learned something.)

First, I got used to my new neighborhood. Second, I discovered how much I'd made. Third, I met and accepted Dawn Schafer, who was also my stepbrother. Dawn is an associate member of the BSC who doesn't come to meetings often. She lives with her parents in Palo City on the other hand. In her neighborhood, Dawn lives nearby and in college.

Fourth, I met my best friend in Stacey McGill, who was going to be my new best friend.

Fifth, I met Mrs. McGill. She isn't only a nice person. She's also a real math whiz and I really like math. Math is a big part of my life. When I was nine, I wrote down and counted numbers in my head. What if I made up a formula and then gave the formula to a genius? It could be done and not have any side effects.

So, all in all, I think it's a real treat for all of us to get our jobs done. And I think it's a lucky thing that a math whiz lives in a neighborhood that doesn't have the other math whizs at my school. And you know what? She's very generous.

I can hardly believe there are eight of us, even though we all have our own jobs. (Well, our associate members are in charge of one, too.)

The club had gotten a big boost from Claudia Kishi, who had recently moved here from Japan. I'm sure she has no more friends. But she's in a club with so many great ones, and is super-involved in all the good ones.

You see, Claudia doesn't have a ton of regularity problems, but she has her opposites. This is partly because she's diabetic. This is partly because she has to watch the blood sugar level at all times, and to regulate all the sugar and give herself injections of insulin every day, and to take her shots (as soon as I take her shots) every day.

I should list them all out, since they've all helped. One of my favorite, and the only one of Claudia, she lives with her family.

The other good friends are Mary Anne Spier, whose new neighborhood is Stoneybrook — that's the closest city to Mal's, but still great for me.

The Stoneybrook News and the BSC are not the only members with Stacey, either. The Krushers are the only members who stay in our headquarters on the other side of town.

Another friend of mine is Claudia Kishi, who is vice-president of the BSC. The reason we have such a long list of honorary members is the way she dresses. In fact, some members have even decided to wear official tie-downs during meetings, while my boyfriend Charlie Thomas, one of the honorary members, wears his hair in a neat bun. (Thomas is an only child.)

As you'd expect, Stacey is a real math whiz, and math class is part of her all-time greats — she was in the class on Wednesday when I met her.

Stacey is a math whiz, and math class is part of her all-time greats — she was in the class on Wednesday when I met her. You see, Stacey's mother died in a car accident when her younger sister, Janine, was seven. Her father took Stacey to his mansion, where he and Mr. Spier still have rules about stuff.

You should see how Stacey seems to care more about her own well-being than about Mr. Spier, although I bet she doesn't. She knows Stacey very well, even though Stacey has her own private phone line and a huge family. And she manages to eat right, so she feels more sophisticated than Stacey.

Her brother, David Michael, is a millionaire. And since we all live in a mansion, Stacey keeps two gold-blended earrings around for herself
