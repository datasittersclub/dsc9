 of Anna. That’s where the idea for the club came from. We all thought, why not give a kid a methodical, but often not, a sitter like Kristy would be a snap.

The Baby-sitters Club was one of our first big steps. At first we advertised, with fliers, but people just turning on their neighbors and talking to other sitters spread our business. We meet three times a week, and people have either picked us up or dropped us off that we meet on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in their houses. Our clients just hang around and we keep our business running smoothly.

We keep the BSC on time and accurate and up-to-date. With a BSC record book, we know exactly who’s available — our clients, of course, is the reason the club works so well. The BSC also contains a club notebook, a notebook in which we write about every single sitter we baby-sit for, and a notebook in which we write about having a group of four or five kids sit at one time. One of us goes through the entire notebook, while the other two decide what to do.

I can’t tell you how often I’m amazed at how well the BSC works. It’s so simple and elegant. Why wouldn’t you ask the BSC secretary if you asked her position? Of course, it works that way, because the secretary always looks up her positions in the record book. She can figure out what’s happening at a given time, and assign it to a person. Kristy is a great secretary. Not only does she keep a master calendar, but she also has to check all the schedules — her own. For example, if a kid is going to be in trouble, she needs to know exactly who’s available. Then she’s in charge of providing that information, making appointments and then recording the money we earn.

Also, unlike at our regular meetings, when a parent calls us with a demanding job, Mom needs to know exactly when and for what time. That’s why she’s in charge of the treasury envelope. She keeps the contents of the envelope, along with the names of the responsible adult (the one who took the money), the rate we’ll charge (if we earn enough money, that is), and important information — the entire reason for getting the job.

One last thing about us. Our meeting hours are from five-thirty to six. That’s because we’re all BSC members, but you know what? Some of us are holiday baby-sitters, while the rest of us are holiday go-baks.

We also have a club notebook, in which we each write about every single job we go on. The notebook is like a journal, with notes about every single job we go on. This is a great way to keep track of what’s happening with our clients. It’s a great way to keep track of the lives of our very own, and of keeping track of who may be at a particular job.

It sounds simple, and it is, but it really is very, very simple.

We start with a description of the job and an idea of how the job works. Then we’re supposed to read the notebook once a week, so our clients know what’s happening on their plates. Then we’re supposed to write in it — and that’s it.

It’s a good thing we have a club record book, because we keep one handy and tidy, all the time. The record book contains all our notes, information about our clients, and a description of our schedules. In it, we also keep an up-to-date set of client names, addresses, and phone numbers, as well as one calendar with information on each job. It’s a huge work, but it’s a lot of work if your baby-sitting job is going to have to spend as much time doing our things as we do.

So the simple fact is that we use the record book to keep an eye on our clients. Simple fact is that we also use the record book to report back on our earnings, since we have a lot of baby-sitting calls to make. Simple fact also is that we pay dues to Kristy’s old job, which is to keep the club record book open for business.

And, last but not least, we’re all good friends, so we get along really well. That’s because we’re all really good friends (except when it comes to calling each other by her first names — she’s called me — Kristy’s friend Shannon).
