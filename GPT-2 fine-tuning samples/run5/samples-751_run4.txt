“Hoodies!” Kristy Thomas called out from the back of the room.

Emily Michelle flew into the room at Kristy’s command. Her long black hair swept over her shoulders and darted gracefully gracefully gracefully across Kristy’s back.

“Hi, Kishi!” Kristy called out next. “Who was that?”

“Who was that?” Shannon Kilbourne gasped. “She was sitting for a big party, and I was sitting for the Ramseys!” She limped into the room just in time to join Kristy, and before she could say “Hi, everybody!” A voice boomed in the room. A man? I should have known that he was Kristy’s supposed friend.

“Who’s that?” asked Kristy. She was sitting on the floor, along with all of the other members of the BSC, at Kristy’s feet. (I’d been watching closely, and as I was making sure everything was set up, Kristy lifted a book with a stroke. “This may be the book on Thomas.' "It’s kind of like Oscar Wilde in Wilde’s Park," I said. “The one on Kristy Thomas.)

“What’s the significance of that?” Kristy asked.

“The Papadakises,” answered Claud happily. “The one who’s going to sit for the Thomas/Brewer kids.”

“The Papadakises!” moaned Kristy.

It wasn’t as if the rest of the world was as interested in these two friends as I was.

I couldn’t help it. When the phone hung up, I went over to Kristy’s. “Hello?” I called again, this time to Claudia’s. Then I dialed. “Hello.” I found her number right away. (I’d written a check to acquire her permission to use her private number, since Claudia is not a personal number but a business associate member.)

“Hi!” I said. “Hello, Kristy … Emily Michelle!” I dropped my tune. (She’s a regular girl from Peoria, and I knew her well.)

Claudia looked up and gave a big smile to Kristy. “Uh — — —”

“What’s wrong, Mallory?” Kristy said, suddenly shaking her head. She opened her door but did not turn.

I jumped in. “Hi,” I said.

“What’s the big biggie?” she repeated, suddenly. “I’m here. Biggie. Candy-goods manufacturer.”

“Gross,” I said.

“I was just about ready to leave,” Mallory said. She took a deep breath. “Come on,” she said. “It would be easy —”

“Very easy, that is,” I replied.

“It is exactly as you told me.”

I stepped out of the living room and ran between Claudia and Mary Anne. I slammed the door behind me. “Do you think I could sleep in your bed tonight?” I offered the window to Mallory.

“Sure. Would you?” Mary Anne joked.

I yawned. “Night,” I said, and counted to six. “Leaving?”

“Sure. You don’t have to leave.”

“Okay,” I said. “You have to leave whenever you come home from work.”

I looked up and saw that I’d already taken a few swipes at Mary Anne. “Well, Kristy isn’t used to looking at boys, so I knew I had to leave.”

Mary Anne gave a horrified gasp. “You’ve known that, have you?”

With a dramatic sigh, Mary Anne descended the stairs. “What?”

“Your mother said leave every time’s proved useful,” I said to Kristy, who’d just come into the room.

“Oh, please.” She sat down in the director’s chair. “Can I ask one
