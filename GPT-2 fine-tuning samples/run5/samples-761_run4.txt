-SMS. We pay dues once a week, and we're responsible for supplying snacks, water, and basic stuff like that. Kristy’s the treasurer because we really care about money. We don’t draw dues from the poor kids who live near us, since we need them to fund Kristy’s Krushers.

Stacey is our resident math whiz and math whiz. At eight IQs and a half, she can put a football in a pile of clay (she also happens to think school is an art form), and then sculpt it into a silly game show figure. She also happens to be one of the founding members of the Baby-sitters Club (also known as the BSC). You might think that a thirteen-year-old math whiz like her would be intimidating, but she actually fits in perfectly with the other members of the BSC. She’s a talented artist who loves to paint, draw, sculpt, and make jewelry. And she has a mind full of strange ideas — for children!

Claudia Kishi is one of the founding members of the Baby-sitters Club. We meet three times a week, and many of our clients really like us, because we put them in touch with them regarding sitting jobs. Claudia’s a total junk food nut, mainly because she has to spend tons of time in bed, when her parents are not looking, plopping under her bed, and reading. She also has to plaster her nails, for hanging junk food, and give herself injections of DHA (Dawn's Milk Naturally) every day. Claudia was eating the junk food and injecting herself with it, and her friends and I kept bumping into each other all afternoon, because those days are over.

“Okay, Claud, we’re done,” Kristy announced as the members voted to begin.

“That’s all for today,” said Kristy.

“Who has the last piece of candy?” Mary Anne asked from the corner of her desk.

Kristy looked down with a bored expression on her face as she told us who had what.

“Snickers?” I said teasingly.

Kristy grinned and shook her head.

The last BSC member, Mal, came in next for a quick buck.

“Hi, you guys!” she said.

“Hello, Claudia,” I said. “Well, today I am the last to arrive in my regular room.” (Kristy can be a pain in the ass.) “My parents are letting me get in and out of here easily …”

“Right!” Mal volunteered.

“Great,” I said. I tried hard to sound cheerful.

“I’ll tell you exactly what we can expect,” Kristy informed us. “All right, everybody.” She laid out bags of candy on each of us’s chairs.

Mary Anne started reading. “This year, this year …”

There were six of us and four of us washers and cranks. They were gathered in Claudia’s room, with their father sitting in a director’s chair. I had ordered the chips, and David Michael started making sour cream and ice cream.

“Ready?” Kristy asked. When all the candy had been scooped out to one side on each side of her face, Kristy appeared at the director’s chair from her drawing. She took one of the snacks and swallowed. “This is the best present I’ve ever received.”

“What?” I asked.

“Neat,” said Kristy. “I think she needs a visor, I guess. I think she took it home last night. They’s so cool they’d never know who they left with.”

“Yeah, and the visor looks like a pharaoh,” said Claud.

“Exactly,” I admitted.

Stacey was checking her watch. “She will find them again tonight,” she announced, pulling a carton of chewing gum out from under her bed.

Claudia, Mary Anne, Dawn, and Kristy were all about to get a mouthful of the stuff when one particularly huge grin came over Stacey’s face.

It was this guy from The Usual Suspects. I’ve already mentioned several times that he’s very attractive and very funny. I like this guy because he acts like a real sleight-of-hand. He knows all about what his clientele wants and when
