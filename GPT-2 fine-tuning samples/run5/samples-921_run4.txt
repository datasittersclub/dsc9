 dim-creamy, and the smell of stale popcorn. He told me it was a great idea.

"Okay, I'll let you know right away," I said. I pulled out a box of M&M's, both of them wrapped up in plastic, and signed the cards they'd signed.

I felt so good about the package I was carrying, even though I didn't bring it to Claud's meeting. I was worried. I didn't want to make a last-ditch effort to hide snacks. But Claud wanted them on the pile of snacks, so I took them down and handed them to her. Then I picked up my Snickers bars, which I'd opened over the snacks, and ate without looking at any of the chocolate.

I wasn't exactly hungry, but I managed to eat two pints of M&M's, which I slid into my backpack. When I reached Claud, who was sitting in her seat, I found her hands full with the snacks.

Claudia is not a terribly hungry person, but her parents forbid her to eat things with artificial colors or textures — like chocolate — in it. That's why Claudia paints her food (mostly organic, and mostly healthy) that way. There are other things Claud can't eat, such as pretzels, or wheat germ-free bread.

My other concern was the junk food. I pulled out a couple of coupons from the bank of my favorite, short straight line at the wheel. I was still missing some peanuts, but I decided I wouldn't pay much attention to detail if I were going to watch a big primetime sports game. The snacks were also missing a few of my favorite candy, so I took a bite, too.

By five-fifteen all my parents had left. I leaped to my feet, grabbed my pack, and ran upstairs. The game was still going, the clock was ticking, and I needed to go home.

I dashed down the stairs. I slammed the door behind me. Maybe I could stay the night there. Maybe I could come to Stoneybrook, in the family's dollhouse. Maybe. But my plan didn't stack up. In fact, I was worried about the entire night. The more I ran, the more I pulled myself together and said how sorry I was. I didn't want anyone else scared to a fault. And that's exactly what I did. I thought of Kristy Thomas, my best friend, who died a slow, lonely death in another lifetime. I remember thinking it was as if my parents were making a million combined plans, yet somehow the end result was exactly the opposite. I felt totally lost.

I dashed to my room, slamming my door behind me. “Ooh! Gone! Gone!” I said, panting. I heard the footsteps. I heard Mom. I dashed into my room and ran. After what seemed like an endless amount of time, I found Susanoo, my oldest brother, and sat down on my bed. Then I heard my mom. I nearly choked. She must have realized I was crying because I opened my drawer and pulled out two Nancy Drew books I’d kept hidden.

“Here they are!” Susanoo cried into my room. “We’ve finally managed to put them out.”

I burst out laughing. “Not the Nancy Drew books!”

“That drives me wild!” Mom said. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. I have the whole trunk of them. I’ll give you two of them for the price of one Nancy Drew book. I’ll give you the rest for a fair price.”

I got off the bed and sat down on Susanoo’s left shoulder. “Well, the books are in my possession.”

“That’s true. But I need to get them back.”

“Not tomorrow, not three months from the time I come home —” Susanoo stopped. Then, with a dramatic gesture, she dropped the books on her lap. “What about you? Are you still looking for those books?”

“I’ll have Susanoo’s books for posterity,” Mom said sensibly.

“I’ll have cookies for you, too. My heart aches for the books.”

I closed my eyes. Susanoo was smiling at me. I dropped the books in my lap and leaned my arm up to stroke her sensitive head.

“See? I really like those cookies.”

“How about two TOT books?”

“Two mysteries?”

I looked deeply at Susanoo. She’d lolled her
