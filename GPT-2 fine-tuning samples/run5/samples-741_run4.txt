======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 pretty kind of funny way of talking about my life. I was so excited. Things have really been great for me lately, I think. Here's what my dad says about me: “Becca can change you’s mind,” or “I’ll take her out with a real treat.” That’s her way of saying Becca is not fun; that she’s not interested in boys, never has been, and doesn’t care what anyone else thinks.

And, boy, do parents care about their kids’ beliefs. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don’t. But I think it’s lucky that Dad is so cool. Maybe he’s just lonely and lonely doesn't feel right. He’s lonely just the way he's lonely, too.

The other thing I said was that Dad loves kids and thinks that everybody should be able to do whatever they want. That’s certainly a conservative position; not everyone can have a huge family. However, he does seem a little lenient toward a certain group of people. Not long ago, he got caught in a car wreck because he had three young kids (two younger, later, in their educations) in tow. He’s learned lessons from that situation, but I think he must have learned from his mistakes. He’s still in high school, but he’s grown a lot.

So, you’d see what I’ve made out to say — that my life is pretty romantic. You wouldn’t believe all the times I’ve cried at people I go out with, or when I cry at a sad TV commercial. And, of course, you wouldn’t see all the ugly details of my life. For example, I’m not a horrible person, but I am in love with Charlotte, my newlyweds' neighborhood, and the neighborhood I grew up in. I moved to Stoneybrook from Long Island, which is pretty close to the city.

And then I got married. And which wasn’t really so. I was on the couch with Dad, thinking about Becca all the time. I couldn’t believe what happened. I’d just gone through what Dad had called a traumatic adolescence. I mean, the kind of emotional turmoil that can drive a person in a madman’s way. I mean, anything is possible when you have one brain, I guess.

For a long time the girls in my school were my friends. They’re the most recent additions to our family. We moved to Stoneybrook from Long Island, which took its name from the Long Islanders, who had been the original Long Islander minority. We changed our name to reflect our new group of friends.

Now you’ll know them perfectly, if you’re wondering. They’re Mary Anne’s best friend (and another BSC member, Dawn!). She’s also the only BSC member to have two older brothers, Sam and Charlie, who are triplets. They’re also stepsisters.

They used to be close. Boy, were they close. In fact, Mary Anne and Dad had been friends since before they knew they’d met each other. Back then, Mary Anne used to ask me about Claud’s car — every now and then I’d creep back. I’d lose hope. I’d have to go to therapy.

Mary Anne had great ideas. (For some reason, just like Dawn always does, she is the world’s number one romantic. She was originally from California, but she decided to move back to it when her father’s company transferred him around.)

We’ve been in this situation where Mary Anne has to hide our valentine because she’s hiding the Valentine's card ones, too.

The valentine was Claudia’s idea. She’s super creative — she paints, sculpts, makes jewelry, draws, sells sewing kits, and more.

The drawing she’d given us was beautiful. It was of an African American dressed in the outfit that he or she had brought along when he first came to America. The kid was wearing a white tuxedo shirt with a wide plaid shirt and the tuxedo tuxedo shirt with white shirt underneath. It was this outfit that came to look familiar at a time when the color mix was pretty different. The tuxedo shirt looked cool, but you couldn’t help noticing the tuxedo shirt was pulled up to the waist and looking like he was in a tuxedo. That’s the kind of outfit a tuxedo is made of.
