======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 more great, so I went away to college. For a while my dad was miserable, but eventually he loosened up. He got married again, and we all moved into his mansion. It was a mansion, huh? Anyway, Richard and I got married, then Mom and Watson and I started seeing each other. That was really exciting....

We became friends and soon Richard and I were the only ones free to go out with Andrew and the Thomases. Soon after that, my brother went overboard, too. He became homesick and went back to boarding school. Then I realized this wouldn't last. Richard couldn't eat meat, or even sit on the floor, and I had to spend almost all my time with my brother. I didn't want to be a part of any of this, either.

I hate to make fun of Mary Anne and all her friends (or at least not too many people), but Stacey is the BSC's treasurer because she's a real math whiz. She's a real math whiz because she's in math class (although there's a little more at Stoneybrook Middle School) because it's her special talent to come up with brilliant, one-of-a-kind things to show the other parent when they need them and keep track of how much they spend. She's an amazing math whiz, and her dad is a major whiz.

You must be curious about Mary Anne, or you wouldn't know her as Mary Anne, if you knew her background. In fact, Mary Anne is one of the shortest girls in the BSC. She has brown hair and brown eyes.

What sort of person is Mary Anne? You would think I’d love to know, but I never will. Not because she isn’t. But because she is my friend and because I look like her.

Mary Anne is beautiful. I’m not kidding. At 5-foot-1 and with brown eyes and brown hair, she has the perfect height and she doesn’t seem to mind that her hair is shorter. Mary Anne also cries at school. If you ask her, the answer is no. She is very sweet and sensitive, and I think she was born to be a mother.

But there must be some other quality that makes Mary Anne different from the rest of us. For example, boy she is. She’s outgoing, she’s on point, and she’s funny. Plus, she’s funny with a capital A at her command. Mary Anne’s parents are divorced. Her mom visits them whenever she feels particularly alone. Plus, she’s pretty independent. Like Kristy, Mary Anne would not have perfect grades just to be around these people. She’s not average or anything. She’s just a lot of fun.

Mary Anne will have a funny accent if it's all right with her mother and her dad. Also, if it’s all right with her mother and not having a dad, maybe he should hire a landscaper — or maybe not. See how many people in Stoneybrook have had job offers similar to Mary Anne’s? Five times out of six. It was the job of the day!

When I think of Mary Anne it’s like a lightning bolt. She’s on so much the right way. And she’s creative and bold and wild. I dream of meeting her onstage, standing onstage, singing Be Smart to the tune of My Favorite Musketeers. The audience is so packed and her voice so calm, you don’t even notice her mouth half full. I’m dying for her when I see her onstage. She’s not a twerp or anything. She’s actually pretty funny. She’s on our side all the time. She loves sports and ballet and has a lot of practice at school.

And she’s smart as shit. She wants to be an editor for a magazine and a regular writer and illustrator of children’s books. She’s on the New York City radio and the Broadway radio. She wrote our lead-in characters in "The Black Stallion" when we were not invited. But Mary Anne has an incredible talent for storytelling. I think it shows in her voice and her artistic sense of humor. Oh, and her boyfriend, Logan Bruno, is a real sleight-of-hand, a member of the BSC.

When I think of Mary Anne’s family it’s hard to believe that her parents are divorced. Mrs. Pike and Mr. Spier are, well, their families aren’t. What are they going through? They’ve just gotten married, have two kids from their first marriage, and two young stepfamilies who aren’t living with them at all
