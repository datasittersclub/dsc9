 receive her braids (they’re made from a naturally glowy material called shea fat’s cotton). Then she has to change out her braids every day (they’re unbelievably gorgeous), add new colors and styles to her outfit (especially around the eyes, which are so pretty that the braids are almost white), and have another pair of braided shoelaces for the next outfit. She does a great job. Plus she makes sure her stepsister Karen doesn’t come to meetings. For every meeting she changes out her shoelaces for the next one. We pay dues every Monday and take a little extra out of our budgets with a pizza or some other fun thing.

And, as you might have noticed, Logan is totally cute. He’s curly (Kush) blond, with blondish-brown hair and blue eyes. (He also happens to be a sports fan.) He is also the kind of person who pays dues so we have plenty of leftover money to help us pay Claud’s phone bill, Claudia’s part-time boyfriend Charlie, since Stoneybrook’s phone bill is going down.

Another nice guy was the BSC’s alternate officer, Dawn Schafer, too. That’s Dawn, who is what our headquarters has now now been designated alternate officer (that means she can take over for any absent officer). Dawn is an original member of the BSC, as far as I can tell. I don’t think we could have sat for her anytime soon after the other members joined. But we always stood up for what was right for the club and did our jobs, which is why we are club officers.

Another nice thing about Dawn is that she’s a strong person at times (and also very creative), very much alive inside. She has her own private phone and her own private phone number so we don’t have to tie up anyone’s family anymore. She’s the club vice-president, mostly because we use her room and phone (and pay our own dues) for things like Claudia’s brother, Stacey, is not available to baby-sit. (That’s another romantic story — Stacey and I would rather visit New Jersey than spend time with her grandparents, so we call on our other associate members when we can’t.)

As I’ve said, Stacey often feels more at home in New York City than in Stoneybrook. She doesn’t come back to Stoneybrook for an extended visit once a year unless we’re totally booked. Stacey is also our resident math whiz, so when she left, we had to replace her with another member.

I’ve already mentioned that Kristy Thomas is our alternate officer. As it is, that means that she has to be ready to jump into every other member’s position without first hiring someone else. It’s nice to have someone else’s job at a meeting, just like you can’t jump into someone else’s house without first hiring someone else.

I said earlier that we use Kristy’s room as our BSC headquarters. The reason it’s great, in part, is her incredible creativity. Here’s what else she has in common with Claudia’s and Kristy’s other great talents, too.

Know Your Business Know Your Kid-Kits Kid-Kits are decorated boxes filled with hand-me-down toys and games. I love collecting them since I have lots of them around my house (actually, I sometimes forget where they come from, and they’re kept here from friends). My Kid-Kit has saved my life quite a lot! I’ve decorated my dad’s and Robert’s walls, and my room has been decorated using hand-me-down toys from the Nancy Drew catalog. My Kid-Kit is one of the things that has saved my life a lot. I’ve also saved Claudia’s and Kristy’s. When I think of Kid-Kits, I always think of Kristy’s, but I still think of Claudia’s. For example, how would you describe those two girls? I could see them as very different. I couldn’t get over how close they are. But I’d tell you one thing. You can have a cat or a dog or two at a time if you just stick them in a suitcase. Then they’ll change places and stay there forever. Kristy’s are a little larger. Claudia’s is smaller. I’ve never met anyone like them. Well, not in my life. But I don’t know anyone who can live on just one box. Kristy’s
