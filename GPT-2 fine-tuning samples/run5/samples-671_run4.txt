======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Nancy Anne’s mom (her dad’s going back to New York for good), she’s the one who signed me up for the BSC. She thinks I look like a five-year-old Mal, and she knows the marks. I’m her size, I’m cute, and I’m a little over five feet tall.

Mary Anne’s mom died when she was nine, so she lives with her father and a little brother. Mr. Spier (Kristy’s dad) doesn’t live terribly near the homes all the regular nine-year-olds are staying from now on. He still lives with his parents, a stepmother, two older brothers, and a baby brother named Karen.

Mr. Spier wasn’t thrilled when he heard about my interest in sports. I said I’d like it, but I didn’t want to ruin his enthusiasm once I began to speak badly about him. I was pretty angry when I heard Karen say she didn’t want to play next weekend.

“I wouldn’t mind if you did, I don’t want to anyway,” said Karen. “I would enjoy working with you.” She held up a long wooden stick. “I might try out for some club kids,” Karen added.

“Cool!” Abby Stevenson said out loud. She was Mary Anne’s boyfriend—she became the BSC’s other good friend after I told her about the Papadakis kids’ surprise arrival.

“Cool, huh?” Stacey McGill said, laughing. She was the club’s other associate member, and now she’s back with us.

“Yeah, I thought so too,” I said, pretending to laugh. I was just about to tell Abby that I really miss her.

“You know what kind of parents I was? A little older than you’d expect,” she said. “And you looked up my best friend Mary Anne Papadakis in the dictionary.”<|endoftext|>
On the day Claudia made a million phone calls, I saw the wheels turning. Her mother and Watson’s father had recently married and both had younger siblings. On either day, Claudia checked her watch. She was almost in the doorway when Kristy and Mary Anne Ramsey came in. For two dollars and a half, Kristy ordered pizza.

“And for three dollars I got a bag of pretzels!” Claudia said, stuffing two bags into a fistful of sandals. “Let’s have fun!”

I couldn’t help laughing. So I said good-bye, hugged my father, and headed for my room.

I figured if my mom and Watson were going to be together I didn’t want them to look like babies anymore. And if my dad was going to be gone the day after I arrived, I really needed my little brother, too.

“Here we are,” mused my mother. “I finally had my greatest moment since my Grandma’s.<|endoftext|>
I sat down at Claudia’s bedside and pulled out what must have been a very big notebook. With my visor on, Jessi Ramsey was sitting in the director’s chair, our club notebook in its entirety. (The rest of the club was in Claudia’s director’s chair. But that is not the only reason we hold meetings in her bedroom.) We write up our jobs in the notebook, and then we read things about other people. This is a very effective way to earn money, and I think it works so well because we are so different. For example, I’m a girl. I live next door to everyone else, and yet I wear colors that might make one glance at them as strange. This is one of the reasons I was invited to join the Baby-sitters Club. I mean, really, who could have expected girls of color to be good baby-sitters? I mean, girls of color can be pretty effective, but they sure aren’t always good at baby-sitting. Luckily, Jessi loves her BSC family, and she likes every second of the meetings.

Jessi was sitting in her director’s chair, writing down information she’d gotten since the beginning — my brother, my new stepsister, my stepsister’s new stepsister, our baby-sitting job. I started to think about how weird it would be for Ms. Frost to have one down the drain — that she and Kristy were going to be friends forever — before I realized just
