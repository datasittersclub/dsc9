, she was the only BSC member with a steady supply of energy: a digital camera, two earbuds, a pair of socks, and a pair of sneakers. But after all those years, she says, her life changed, too. Claudia has been thinking all this time and all she is thinking now is her notebook. She wants to write a history of BSC meetings. It would be a great addition to an old BSC notebook. This is a memory that, when I was little, was punctuated by those three punctuation marks and all that.

As secretary, Claudia keeps the record book. She keeps it closed. She makes it up on her own. She makes sure we are all present for every sitting job we go on. She doesn't bother us much with the record book at all, since we are all busy with our other jobs. Sometimes the book can be a pain to read, unless you're the only member with a computer and a phone. There's just one excuse: Mary Anne has trouble reading it. So Claudia keeps a little notebook. That notebook holds information about each of us (and every member, including myself) so that when we're ready to go home we don't look a bit weary, nor impatient, nor bored. But when the notebook is not in the notebook, Mary Anne seems totally out of sorts. If I had to pick a subject or two from a list of the things I'd do in an afternoon and forget them in an hour, I wouldn't bother to read it. I'd just spend hours scouring the pages.

Mary Anne's not in Stoneybrook. She visits California. She visits her dad, her older brother, and their pets, which would be enough to fill Claud with dread. It's hard to imagine how she could even exist in her parents' home on Long Island with all these little brothers and girls. If there were any room for another family, Mary Anne would probably move to New York, where her dad can live in his previous house with his old one-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Emily Michelle.

Anyway, when the BSC was born, the club did all business. But the club split up after I quit. For the next seven years, Mary Anne stayed with the club until she was convinced the club was too big and too inefficient. During those years she has only had a few friends. One of them is David Michael, who is the other is Claudia Kishi.

Claudia is Japanese-American and very beautiful. She's dressed in a crazy way and is very sophisticated. She's even been trained to stand up for herself.

It's not my style, it's hers. Claudia is a big dresser with an extremely long hairstyle. Her skin is medium-dark-brown with red streaks running down her chest and a shiny black belt that flutters over her waist.

Claud is the only member who has a steady boyfriend. And Claudia is the only one who has a steady family. There are seven of her two brothers and three sisters, and her father is a huge millionaire. Claudia keeps her family mostly together with a steady boyfriend, which would be a nice addition to the BSC.

Oh, so a good boyfriend might also come in handy the next time you're with a new family: before the holidays.

This was the last meeting before school ended at five-thirty on Wednesday, September 5, 1993.

There was a long silence as the rest of us worked on the record book. Claudia had already started the notebook. She rested her forehead against the pages and looked at it with a steady glance. It was a perfect writing record, with the neat lines, dark punctuation, and a perfect handwriting style to match her writing. Claudia and I read at exactly the same time.

Claudia is the BSC treasurer. She keeps the dues up-to-date for future use. She doesn't need to give us any information about the dues, but she needs our money for stuff she has to do at school. We all hand over the dues to Claudia, who is in charge of the treasury room.

We use this money to pay Claudia's phone bill, for a few things. For instance, we pay for a few items for the holiday special. And there's also some junk food. For instance, we buy Nancy Drew books, and sometimes Nancy takes a trip to the mall, but those are very little. But at least there's plenty to spare with the money we earn.

Speaking of Nancy Drew books and stuff such as that, Claudia was sitting across from me, her blonde hair permed. She was looking really pleased with herself. Claudia was the only one standing with her hand flat on the floor, staring into the eyes of her BSC friend Laine.

Laine is our alternate officer so she doesn't have to do much. She
