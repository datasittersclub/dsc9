======== SAMPLE 1 ========
’s mother is dying of leukemia, and Kristy’s grandmother Mimi is dying of cholera. When the Baby-sitters Club was formed, Mary Anne was the vice-president. Now her sister, Janine, is taking over Janice’s duties.

Now I know Mal's not the only one who’s lost a sister or boyfriend. Mary Anne’s brother, Jeff, has come back from a trip to the East Coast, and it’s almost five feet (she’ll be shorter than him) and overweight. When he returns, Mary Anne must choose her next of friends, or she'll be driven out of the club.

“Claudia, what’s wrong?” Kristy asked.

A moment later Claudia answered, “It’s just me.”

“Really?”

“Well, let me start at the beginning. Dawn and Mary Anne are still in the club, and then I can’t go anywhere else.”

“I’ll take it.” I took my usual position, and Kristy was already sitting right in the middle of me. “So how’s everything?”

“Great!” I said. “But Mary Anne has a little trouble with it. It is only a year and a half.”

Claudia looked unhappy. Kristy, who is a little jealous of Dawn, and I, because we are opposites in temperament, have our differences. But there they are, blended up with grace, with opposites accentuated by opposites hairstyles.

“Okay,” Kristy said.

We were off and running. The BSC was just launched, and our newest member, Shannon Kilbourne, was the first to fill a position.<|endoftext|>
“This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club will now come to order!”

Kristy checked her watch. “All right. I have three business meetings to attend to in less than an hour.” (The club calendar is one big picture, with a section on club business — starting appointments, managing expenses, and so on.)

“And it was my turn to sit for Mrs. Addison.”

“That’s right.” Kristy turned to Claud. “This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club will now come to order, Mary Anne.”

She cleared her throat and gave me a thumbs-up sign. Then she passed the envelope around. “Let’s send this over to Claudia and Kristy at four-thirty to … ’Claudia, can I help?”

This was not going to happen!

In the end, the last two BSC members, Jessi Ramsey and Mallory Pike, took the address at the very last minute. But guess what. Nobody was particularly worried. The BSC, which had been formed to keep track of our schedules and baby-sitting troubles, really had turned their backs on their regular clients.

Maybe that’s why we’re two good friends. We love baby-sitting. And we plan to keep those jobs.

I wonder how I’m going to handle being the only other BSC member with a boyfriend.

I wonder how a person who loves to read can handle being the first BSC member with a boyfriend.

I’m not sure.

I have a boyfriend.

I’ve been in this situation before, just because Claudia forgot one of her favorite books. When she opened it, I was bent over the middle of a toilet, trying to catch my breath while everyone else fished a mouthful of water out of their mouths and tried to wipe their faces.

When the phone rang and the rest (as they said) came, the idea seemed totally natural.

So we started doing it ourselves, combining the best of both worlds — at home and in our rooms.

So that’s the BSC, now working to keep up with the best interests of our clients. (We all have our own schedules, of course.)

Kristy's Baby-sitter’s Club has two members: me and Abby. (I’ve already mentioned that Abby likes to baby-sit.) We meet three times a week, with plenty of regular hours.

Since Kristy lives near me and has a private phone line, it’s easy for her to reach us. The club has two associate members, and one long-distance, reliable boyfriend. (I’ll tell you about Logan later.)

Since Kristy lives in a
