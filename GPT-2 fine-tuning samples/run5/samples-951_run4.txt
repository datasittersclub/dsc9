 married, and a best friend, Emily Michelle. She and her mom moved to Stoneybrook, which is about two miles from my house, when Kristy’s mom went off to college in California. So there was a lot of moving to do. Kristy’s mother worked hard, so she met and fell in love with Watson Brewer, one of the men I mentioned earlier. After Watson, Kristy’s life changed dramatically. Just when she looked like a normal, fifteen-year-old, blonde, with blue eyes, blond-haired sister, and blue-eyed brother, her parents began moving out of their house. Mrs. Thomas met Watson and married him. Over time she’s been brought back together by her new family, and the Thomases have become a very happy family. Kristy’s brother, though, wasn’t happy, either, since he missed his brother. So Mrs. Thomas met Watson and made some changes to her life. For example, she got married to a guy named Watson Brewer, who just happens to be a millionaire. Now Kristy lives in a mansion across town, and he has loosened up a bit. (Living in a mansion is sort of a rarer sort of mansion.) Plus, Watson happens to be a real, live millionaire, so he has rules for how much food and what and when to spend — rules Kristy had never heard of before.

I looked around me and almost giggle. My friends are, as I mentioned before, very sophisticated. But there are other things we like about Kristy, too. Like her deep brown eyes and her dislike of red meat. I think she’s a terrible student. (Kristy is carnivore. Her favorite foods are meat-and-grilling-animals.) And she has one regret: When her sister, Karen, was diagnosed with breast cancer, she didn’t show up to school to see her scars from the attacks. But she and Kristy keep being Mary Anne killers.

What are Kristy’s other hobbies? Soccer player. She is a player. She is really talented. She can throw (sometimes catch) long-distance throws (metacognition ball). She can throw fast (nibble toss). And she combines great athletic skills with her cool, athletic nature.

Kristy’s most famous achievement is her math class. She has two more V.A. than Claudia does.

“Class!” Claudia exclaimed as she entered the room. “How are you doing?”

Everyone tried to scoop up all the pieces of her puzzle, but it wasn’t enough. Kristy grabbed one of Claudia’s pieces of paper. “Look at this —”

“No!” Kristy groaned. “This is a paper tiger!”

“Kristy!” Claudia shouted, crumpling up the paper tiger she’d dug out of the table. “Sit tight, guys.” Kristy slouched over and found a container that had already been moved to the back of Claud’s room. Sharon checked it and gave Kristy a thumbs-up sign.

“Cool. This is neat.” Kristy lifted the container and shifted it slightly to face her. “This is … beautiful. Like Dawn would have found if they had sat down at that table together.”

“Do you honestly think it will live a thousand years?” Dawn asked.

Kristy shook her head regretfully. “I don’t know. I wish I had an arm ringer.”

Mallory Pike put her hand over her heart. “When did you decide?”

“Years ago. Probably after you and Karen and Dawn moved here.” Kristy looked at Kristy. “Only you know.”

Kristy wasn’t kidding. There was no way she was kidding. But what could be more beautiful than the day the Baby-sitters Club would be a whole lot bigger and better organized than the Baby-sitters Club?

What a rush of friends and family! Everyone was rushing into their own! Now they’d meet at Claudia’s house, make dinner, and watch their mom and dad play video games while they wait out the bad old days.

It was crazy. Everyone was rushing into their own! That was when Kristy found out she’d needed a baby-sitter. That’s when the girls started searching for a sitter for Dawn. That’s when Kristy’s mom became friendly and suggested that she join them.

The club was born. Claudia, Kristy, and Stacey joined and it grew into a
