 can’t be a part of something like that. And in fact, they’re both the opposite of me.

I don’t blame me. I’m not average. If I were average, I wouldn’t have thought to ask the Stoneybrook parents I’m close to such a big deal…. Okay, that was all I said, but I wanted to set the record straight. What happened next shows just how different I can be now.

First we had the big drama. We waited for the phone to ring for about five minutes. Then we listened to it, but the phone never answered … and we took so much time that we almost forgot about it. Then Mrs. Stoneybrook said Mom had a cat and got a dog. I listened and waited and waited and they’d get together again, and, after we heard Mrs. Stoneybrook’s mom calling around the clock, I started to think that was just a misunderstanding. Then I listened to her tell them how she was going to get the dog. That just made me freer to talk to my mom. But the phone never left the room, and we waited for the call to come in.

Mom was pretty sure that would happen, which is not surprising. As soon as it did, we were on our way to the meeting.

Before I go any further, if you’d ever decide to make a commitment like that, don’t make it one you don’t think can be done. Think of just one thing you can do now and then to help.<|endoftext|>
As I lay back down and leaned against Claudia's bed, I couldn’t help fantasizing about the time I would have sat down with either of us. I bet I’d have turned red from being jealous of Logan and her brother. I’d probably also turned into purple.

“Jessi loves red.” I told Kristy, who was leaning against her desk.

“I think she’s reading that somewhere.”

No idea what “that’ means, but in the last week or so Jessi has been reading somewhere. She’s already been reading a lot of books by Marguerite Henry. I think that’s probably because she’s an amazing artist.

“So what do you think of red?” Jessi asked.

“I like it,” I replied. “I like what I like.”

“Why do you think I like it so much?” asked Claudia.

“Because it’s so beautiful,” I replied quickly. “I like it more than anything else.”

“It makes me so happy to be rich,” Claudia said.

Kristy looked at the other girls in the room, then back at me. “But it doesn’t make me happy at all!”

“What makes you happy is that you have so much money?<|endoftext|>
The last time I checked, my parents were rich. It was last week, back in seventh grade at SMS (that’s the highest grade in school). Now they’re so happy I thought someone was out there somewhere (at the bus station) and helping Claudia get into shape. I sat for Mr. and Mrs. Newton at lunch that day but they pulled up outside and only opened the door for us. When I tried to get in, they wouldn’t budge. Instead, they sat on the ground and looked at me and laughed at my jokes, just waiting for me to leave. I guess I was a little jealous of their chances of getting me out of trouble.

When I got back to my room, I opened the record book for my room and checked the books, keeping an eye out for suspicious books I could find that I should have hidden.

I was looking through one book named Emily Michelle. Another named Kristy Thomas. I looked for a note telling me that Mrs. Newton’s boyfriend was looking for a date and that Kristy planned to go out. I made my last search until I went back to my room. Not knowing if anyone was looking, I reached for the book. I closed it, closed that page, and tore open the rest of Emily Michelle’s book. It was in the middle of the description of “LOOK FOR A SITTIN’S CLUB.” I pulled out a list with the names, phone numbers, times, rates, and places they’d be answering the phone. The phone number was in a capital letter, with a tiny dot beside it. In the back were the address and number of the next
