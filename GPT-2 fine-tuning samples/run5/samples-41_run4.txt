======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 — I'll tell you, if you're ever thinking about going to a party.

At my favorite party, I would come.

The idea for this afternoon was my first big one.

I called Emily to see our bill.

There was no idea what I was going to bring.

I was nervous. I wanted to sit for the show, and I thought it would be fun. It was, after all, the only party we've been to.

What?

What?

I had a feeling about it.

How could I have planned such a great idea like that? Why was I so nervous?

I called up Shannon. Shannon asked if she was going to stay and was nervous for a good while.

"Yeah!" she said. "We have a meeting now and there's only one person! How can we organize? You might as well attend."

We checked the boxes. Not one of them was mine.

I made a conscious decision to go. I was going to do anything!

I was going to take the plunge. To the music, the club and everybody else. Then I'd jump on the bike.

But Shannon must have thought I was mad. She'd never been one to sit on her own. I guess she's in high school. She was very excited when I called. She had some ideas. And she's in the top 10 in California.

The most important thing about a girl like her was her strength and determination. In my opinion, Shannon's athletic ability is what makes her great.

I think she has what it takes to be the greatest athlete in California. She is incredibly outgoing, cool and quiet.

I thought I'd be the best kid in the class.

I knew I would soon be the best athlete in California. I also knew I would be accepted. It was a dream come true.

Luckily for me, I had a good boyfriend. He invited me to join a BSC club, and for that, I did what anyone would want a girl to do: It worked out, but the club was kind of a disaster. It was like leaving my mom behind.

But it was only the beginning.

We became the BSC on March 5th, and in the last few weeks we have been organizing BSC visits and phone calls. And I want to tell you about some more of the club members. In order to complete these four steps, you've got to be an official member.

You get invited to meetings! There are meetings for two, three, or four times a month. That means when you've got a big business meeting, you have all the time in the world!

Here's the thing, we've made this club our very own family business and I think it's great — and it has a lot to do with my friendship with Stacey Clift. I met her during our junior year at the club's first club meeting the way she always met me, from my room at night to our bedroom.

Clift, you see, is a professional musician who has been in and out of the club a lot. One of our other BSC members is a great record shopper who runs a good record shop and has a long history with Claudia.

I think Stacey and I are going to love it in general. But we're not going to sit for our club meetings because we feel that doing so wouldn't solve the club's problems, especially that we'd still need our own dues, and because our members are both very professional and very creative. Plus, as BSC president, I've always known Stacey to be one of the most creative people in the business. (She did a great job at the club meeting! Which is cool, but she's responsible.)

Our new member (of whom I'm already a member) Kristy Thomas, is terrific. But we've all known her since I was a baby. Kristy grew up in Portland, and her parents moved there from California when Kristy was in sixth grade.

Since then, Kristy and my mom were very close — but very different lives. Kristy and Kristy are very different families. We grew up in California, but I think I have a pretty good idea of where our family has taken us.

I guess Kristy and Kristy are in no way close. Which brings me to my main idea for the month of March:

I look forward to meeting you, Kristy-san, Monday, March 5th from 5-7PM.

I have a feeling that in the next five years, as Kristy and Kristy get older and Kristy and Kristy get more creative, we're going to develop a more sophisticated family. Kristy and I are planning to spend more time together. (Kristy's a little nervous when her
