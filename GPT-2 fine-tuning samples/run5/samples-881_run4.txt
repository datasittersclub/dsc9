�t a total hipper or a snifter. It’s more a matter of when. I call it a season to keep my brothers entertained at all hours.

I’m the alternate officer. That means I take over for anyone who’s absent.

Claudia’s the only BSC member not to have two sisters (they are best friends). Then there’s Logan and Shannon, too. They’re thirteen and in sixth grade.

They’re called “sister” because they’re identical, although their families don’t have initials. Shannon “companion” because she moved here from Long Island with her mom when her dad was transferred there by his company. Now Logan lives in (as usual) Shannon’s family.

We also have two junior officers, Mallory Pike and Jessica Ramsey. They’re eleven and in sixth grade.

Mallory and Jessi have a lot in common. They are both the oldest kids in their families, like mine are, although they have different opinions on everything from clothes to dogs to strawberries. They’re also both the oldest in their families. Mallory’s family was as big as mine. She has seven brothers and sisters, which is amazing, considering that Jessi’s family just used to live in a house three houses away from mine. (Jessi’s family is just one big family. In fact, Mal and Jessi are part of a much larger family, too.) The other thing that Mal and Jessi have in common is that they both love to read. They like to complain that their school’s homework schedule is "too strict." Believe me, everyone wants to be better than the next best best best best friend best friend.

We also have a few associate members who don’t often attend meetings but who do take on sitting jobs whenever they can. They’re near and dear to me. Their names are Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne, and they’re in the sixth grade.

They love to knit, to crochet, and to write. Each of them has some kind of project coming up. They’re going to be awfully busy with that, though, so they better hurry. Logan has an art project underway, and he’s going to be a ballerina for the upcoming dance season at the community college. Remember that dance? It was his idea. It worked like a charm. See? A year later, when I’d been going through the summer in California with Logan and Karen and Tiffany, Mr. and Mrs. Krushers. I would be on my way to an art show for our fifth-grade dance group.

Our dance classes didn’t start until seventh grade, but the rest of us were doing things like homework and sitting in the afternoons while the sun was setting. By eighth grade we were doing some basic things like taking part in our Krushers projects. By nine we were doing seventh grade stuff, too. We were all gathered around a fire, either at Claudia’s house or somewhere.

We gathered, in Claudia’s room, just behind our kitchen table, with our clients. We would have to wait for them to arrive, but I felt safe and secure in my position. As soon as the phone rang, the phone began to ring, with requests for sitters.

Well, three — and I mean three — times the club members volunteered.

Almost all of the requests were from kids younger than three, so four of us were required to take part.

The one lucky one wasn’t. Her name was Jamie Newton, and guess what. She asked to speak with the sitting president.

Dawn took this very seriously. “Boy, are you a good sitter, Jamie.”

You see, the club president thought for a second before agreeing, “I’ll call you.”

So we did. And the call was good. We gained some members, and steady work took its toll on our club, our clients, and all of us.

It wasn’t the greatest feeling, mind you. But I had to leave Stoneybrook, and the thought of Jamie and I tearing through town on time is still painful to me. (I miss getting to the meetings, mostly because I’m the only one in my family to participate in BSC meetings on time.)

Anyway, that was the picture. I was in my bedroom, thinking of the gorgeous models in the club, when suddenly the next thing I knew, it was smashing another picture into the board. (That had to be the Arnolds for instant fame.)

“I have to be ready to roll!” Jamie shouted,
