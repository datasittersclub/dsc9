======== SAMPLE 1 ========


Claudia picked up two glasses, one black and one white, looking at the clock. “The Baby-sitters Club meeting. We have more business than we can handle. Mrs. Madden’s late for the meeting.” (She’s on hold for a few days.)

“Baby-sitters Club. Tomorrow Mrs. Madden will send us a letter saying she’ll miss her job and that she’ll pay our expenses.” (The meeting was about to begin and we had just finished telling the other parents about Claud’s dance.)

Claudia turned away from the group of us. “You’ve been good. We can’t wait.”

“Yeah?” I sounded worried, but the words stuck in my ears. “I think it’s time.”

“Good idea,” said Claudia. “Baby-sitters club can’t wait.”

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll be at your place.” And I’ve started getting my ears pierced. Claudia took one look at the clock, shrugged, and spoke to us in a loud voice about our business. “Okay, okay,” she told us. “I’ll go,” she said, taking the phone from me and calling as soon as I was sure.”

That was pretty clear-headed, although the last three months have been pretty different. But it was clear that Claudia and I were still looking forward to the day when the club would open its doors to all of you — friends, the rest of us, and the rest of the kids.

As I pulled the record book out of my lap, Claudia gave me a look. “This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club is about to begin!”

“Yes!” I said. “Our meetings start promptly.”

“That’s right. And Mrs. Madden is going out that afternoon with one of the club members and the rest of us — members.” Claud kept dialing in, as if the phone didn’t count and I was still figuring out the rules, while I watched the clock say, 132-1.

I took in the sound of our announcement. I was about to be the first to the club meeting, so I picked up the phone and spoke to the other club members, “Oh, Claud,” I said, “that’s okay. The meeting will come to order.” My friends nodded.

The meeting wound up almost exactly what I had planned. I was the first one to arrive and the club meeting began.

“Club meetings begin now,” Claudia announced. “Club business.”

The room exploded.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club!” I shouted, grabbing the record book and dragging it across my desk. “Hello, club!”

I felt great. I was ready for the job.

“Hello, club,” Kristy Thomas announced. “We’re in business.”<|endoftext|>
I could barely say no to my heart. That night, all my friends had been hanging out — except mine, anyway — and I was standing in the front yard of her house, listening to the phone call.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club!” I said.

“Uh-oh,” replied a woman nearby, “have some tea.” She flipped off the phone so she could dial.

“Okay,” said Claudia. “Let’s begin.”

I sat down and began listening. I'd never sat down since we were babies and Claudia was already arranging the evening’s food — chocolate chips, carrots, peas, chocolate sauce — for me.

“This is Emily Michelle. She’s coming home from a sleepover.”

“Yeah,” replied the woman. “She’s really cute.”

“I’m so sorry,” I said. “She’s going to be sick.”

“Well,” added Kristy, “I’ll make sure you’re at the meeting then.”

I nodded and the clock turned toward five-thirty.

I was probably the last one here, but maybe I missed the fact that my friends were still in the front yard with me. They’d been hanging out for only about an hour.
