ison as your treasurer.”

“Stace, that’s no big deal,” I said. “Actually, it’s a big deal—that’s how Kristy got the idea for us to meet here.”

“Who else had the idea for that strange little office here?”

I pointed to the desk where I keep track of the club members' schedules, which include doctor appointments, after-school activities, and after-school activities that we call after-school clubs. “Stacey, I’m the alternate officer,” I said. “I’ll take over if anyone’s out sick.”

“That’s a new job,” said Dawn, grinning at me coolly. “Not for me. See, I guess I was bored going out. Anyway, let’s make a club.”

“We made this up,” Kristy said.

“Why didn’t you just try out for a club?” I asked. I remembered when Stacey’s parents told their children not to worry. Parents would be nice enough to hear from them.

“Well, Mom, it was great!” Abby said with a smile. “But I think we all wanted to pitch in and help out.”

Kristy glanced at the record book. “I think it would be fun,” she said with a mischievous flourish. “You and Stacey must help each other out in the afternoons, after school, and on the weekends.”

“Oh, you two wouldn’t be perfect partners,” Jessi joked.

“I could help you out, I guess, but I wouldn’t really be perfect partners between parents. Besides, I want to become a children’s book writer and illustrator.”

“How about you help me write the storyboards for the children’ softball team?” Claudia asked.

“Help me make sure all the kids are dressed up and ready for games,” Kristy replied.

At that, I heard Kristy ask if she could help out.

“Write a storyboard for the baseball team,” I replied. “What a game!”

“I’ll make one for the soccer team,” Kristy said with a smile, putting an end to her teasing.

What else did Kristy amass in a busy day? Plenty of it.<|endoftext|>
It's easy for me to picture Kristy on a soap box every day. She’s not at all shy — and she doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of her.

“You look like your age,” I commented, frowning.

“I have a great smile,” said Kristy. “Always.”

“But I had to wear glasses and braces when we were baby-sitting,” I added, looking annoyed.

“Once, when we were baby-sitting for our father’s estate, I got stuck in a switch at the back of his house.”

“That was stupid!” Kristy said. It wasn’t like that at all. The old house was straight up rickety. “You know what switch it was? Nothing,” said their mother. (Her voice was on the low, as if Kristy weren’t heard over her protests.)

“You don’t have to worry,” said their father. “I’ll look great.”

“I’ll have diabetes,” said Mary Anne. “I just got insulin and I just had to wear these pretty new pants.”

“The pants are great,” said Kristy. “I look great in the new pants. I feel terrific.”

“Just for a minute,” I told them. “Tell me about the new pants.”

“No new,” said Kristy.

“Tell me about the new gloves.”

“I don’t believe what I just told you,” I said, throwing my fist around. “I’m still wearing my mother’s old gloves. I guess they’d look nice, though.”

“Cool!” said the other club members agreed cheerfully. They’d been giving me problems ever since my
