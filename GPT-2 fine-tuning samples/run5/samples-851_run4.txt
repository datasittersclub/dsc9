 pets. What’s the shortest, sweetest kid in the world? Try David Michael. He’s two and a half inches taller than Kristy.

Here’s the main difference between Kristy and me: Kristy is diabetic and lives forever; I’m a grown-up and her body can’t process sugar. (It’s not gross, gross, gross, gross.) This does happen, actually, in some people's families. I have an eight-year-old sister named Emily Michelle. Kristy can hardly wait until five to walk. That’s when I need to be. But I’m especially worried about my father, Charlie. Kristy’s mother was talking to another woman a few weeks ago, and the two of them did have a high school reunion, but they probably didn’t really know each other very well. (The one before me was an official, official reunion, by the way.)

Anyway, I have a lot of other rules. No junk food. No talking at parties of any kind. (Kristy likes to take the BSC bus out to parties.) No junk-food or softball games. But, plenty of variety in our lives. I can find a movie in the library and on the train ticket office in no time if I make a list of all the games I’ve watched. (Remember I mentioned my watch?) I can start a game between five-minute periods in any given night just by looking at Claud’s digital clock. That’s because one of her very first jobs in the BSC was making notes on a school notebook. She figured out when I could sit, set up a rule, and then stick it straight in the notebook. For example, if I was watching a movie with a lot of people watching one guy only to find out later that one of the others had already sat for the same people at a different movie. That’s neatness, just like neatness at school. I like experimenting with rules and regulations, even though I don’t mind schoolwork at all.

Anyway, back to my regular clients, the BSC members. We hold our meetings at Claudia’s, since she has a phone with a private number. Since we meet in her room, she never has to use her phone on business, although she sometimes does.

Our clients? Glad you ask. They adore Claudia. Mallory is as much Japanese-American as me. She’s as shy and sweet, as quiet as Adam, and as sensitive as Kristy. When she and I were younger, we spent our lives side by side, looking across Claudia’s aisle in a bright sunlight. Nowadays we meet to chat, eat, and make ourselves comfortable.

Well, that’s the picture. Claudia looks like a model. She has dark eyes with longish lashes and dark skin (the ones our haircuts are pretty different, which makes me sad). But why is she wearing long, curly black hair so much? You never know until you see her outfit. She has purple jade scroungers under the bobby earrings she keeps decorated in deep green. The scroungers, as they are, are from years of jewelry she keeps for herself, and they look amazing. She adds little bits of jade jellies to every mallet she’s ever gotten. She has a little green hunk in her hair, underneath the green stuff.

I told you Claudia’s outfits were so gross and disgusting but you never know what she’s wearing until you see her outfits in the real world. Her house is small and neat, but her life is pretty regular. Her father died in a car wreck when she was nine, and Claudia and her older sister, Janine, grew up with just Janine. Janine is an authentic genius, and she’s a sixth-grader (okay, three, I guess) and she’s smart. But all that wealth does her sister a lot of good. And good enough, in fact, that I’d have to say that Claudia is a pretty fine dresser, which might be one reason she’s got so many BSC clients.

Claud is so neat that she’s even more neat than the rest of us. (Before I ever met Mallory, you wouldn’t have such a mystery face.) Mallory likes to think of herself as a model, too, even though her style is average (and sometimes very trend-challenged). She has shoulder length blonde hair, and perfect blue eyes with dark lashes. She’s the most graceful person I know, and the most sophisticated (and sophisticated-minded), of all of us. Mallory’s mother died when she was a baby, and after she
