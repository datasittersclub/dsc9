 too good, while the rest of us are much too shy to answer. Kristy seems to thrive on being with other members. She even looks a little like Claudia. She is slim and has a cool, bubbly face.

As for Stacey, she looks like some kind of a model. She’s cute with dark eyes and long, silky black hair.

Stacey grew up with her mom, but even so, life has changed. Today her room is more like a test room, with people who could never stand Stacey.

When Stacey decided to enroll in eighth grade, she was extremely out of sorts. Her first choice was Sharon, but Sharon did not let her down. She’s a real junk-food nut and her favorite treat is cookies. (Stacey thinks of them as nutty cookies, but I think they’re better for the kids we babysit.)

Now Stacey has a sister and a mom. (Yup, her mom. Stacey’s mom and Watson’s only child.) And Kristy’s room is packed with little baby-sitters, lots of which are devoted to little Kristy. It’s clear from the club notebook that caring about little girls isn’t always easy. And sometimes Mrs. Pike has to make the work tough because Stacey has two kids of her own, a boy and a girl. (Mr. Pike, a former foster father, is now in the seventh grade.)

Living with the Pike kids may sound like a lot, but Stacey takes it in stride. Stacey is an extrovert and as energetic as most of the rest of us in the BSC. She loves math, reading Nancy Drew books, and sports. (She’s an excellent athlete!) Stacey loves to read horse books (she’s absolutely addicted to them. She’s addicted to reading The Wizard of Oz, too!), and she’s a dedicated junk-food fanatic. Her parents say she should eat more fruits and vegetables and not be allowed to wear braces and glasses. Stacey’s best friend, Emily Michelle, is smart and outgoing and sophisticated and very studious while Kristy and Dawn are quiet and quiet and sensitive. This is because they grew up together.

Since Stacey’s parents were divorced, Stacey and her mom have been Stacey’s only best friend and best friend. In fact, while Abby and I used to look alike (we’d always put on our T-shirts and hats), we seemed more alike. We were all, well, different. But not identical enough anymore.

Now Stacey looks her age with her long red hair, clean blue eyes, and blue nose. She’s the club vice-president since it was her job to run the meetings (which is a job she always gets very well). She also has a steady boyfriend. His name is Logan Bruno!

Abby and I are the youngest members of the BSC. It’s not easy for us to even begin to two girls as young as us. Abby is only a baby, so she cries at the sight of anyone but her parent. Her grandmother died when she was a little girl, and it was hard for her to stand up to her grandparents. She needed comfort from her parents, and they needed strength from her.

Abby is an awesome athlete — but her strength is what makes us stand up to her. We compete in her softball team, and compete in her softball team. That’s what you need to be a pro athlete.

If everyone in the BSC had the strength to compete, Abby and I would be a gold standard. Abby has never had a chance and she has practically destroyed anyone who attempts to challenge her.

As I said before, Abby’s life has not been easy. Her father died when she was a baby, leaving Abby’s mom to cope with a steady diet of junk food and low-quality milk. (The milk also consisted mostly of Sticky Moms Milk and Cheez Dood things. We asked my mom's mom for help with the Junk Moms diet, but she didn’t back down.) Eventually, Abby’s mom met a man named Watson Brewer and, after several years of marriage, they discovered how difficult it used to be for Abby to lose weight. That’s when her parents got married and Abby began her BSC stepsister’s stepsister’s stepsister’s stepsister’s stepsister’s stepsister, too. Abby is a whirlwind. She can be so much more outgoing than she is energetic. She’s energetic because of her experience and the successes she often has. It really helps that she has the “New Hope” movement around her. (
