acey Krushers. They are also my best friends in the BSC, and they are also the perfect mix of size and personality. In fact, Kristy is the best friend in the BSC. She is energetic, independent, and very creative. She loves being in control, and she's just great at coming up with great ideas. And she often proves time and again that she can design a fun game or entertainment for children.

The Krushers don't seem to have one of Claudia's favorite sports. The Krashers have a football and a baseball team called the Rampage â€¦ but, believe it or not, they still have punters in Stoneybrook. They call it their "power team," but they are really only a little bit stingy.

The Krushers coach Nicky Porter recently recruited another local boy, Logan Bruno, to join the team, as well as two girls he'd liked for ages, Claudia and Mallory, who had been his only friends. But, of course, the job was never more than a few calls away. So those girls became friends, and eventually the club was born. That's why when the Krushers decided to add me to the BSC for one of our meetings this summer it was so logical that we all took on the same role.

Logan Bruno is a member of many local groups. We call him the Junk Bucket, because he is one of us. But we used to call him the One True Bucket, because we've all known him. He's another great junk-food fanatic, because you never know when you're going to find a pretzel stuffed with Peanutbutter Dots and a chocolate-chip cookie with the Milk Dots in it; a lumpy bag of Cheez Dots and a peanut-butter-filled bag of Oreos with the Tots and the Hershey's Kisses; and a bag of the same chocolate-chip cereal with the Hershey's Mystery Cheeses.

Logan also has an easygoing nature, too. He just loves sports and having fun. Maybe that makes him the perfect BSC president, especially since we use him, as my unofficial "idea person" (that's the best name anyone can give you), as our honorary SABH (Single Best Overall Organizational Help). Actually, I'd say that club President is the official motto of the BSC. Why? Well, because club members have different ideas about what counts as "idea," and club business has become much more like a business than a hobby.

While most of the members I know and love are avid eaters, some of them are really dedicated to becoming a better baby-sitter, and are just plain lazy. Logan and I are both natural liars, and we're the oldest in our families. Logan's brother Charlie is a baby-sitter from his first household when he was just a baby. He moved back to Stoneybrook when his dad was transferred here. We all grumble, sometimes, but we understand who Logan really is. Logan has the most natural talent for telling the right stories (one reason she's great at telling the truth, of course). She said of him in an interview that she thinks he's "a little kid from Kentucky." (Logan is absolutely gorgeous. She has long, straight black hair, almond-shaped eyes, and sparkling blue-green-green feet. She lives in one of the country's most exclusive cities. You see, Logan is a great kid.)

Logan's family is from Long Island. It's in the city, which is why it's great for running businesses. Logan's father, who was killed in a car accident when she was nine, had gone to live in Stoneybrook with his wife, Karen. But after Mr. Spier left, his folks started to worry that Mrs. Spier wasn't being fair with Mr. Spier. (They should have seen things coming.) Fortunately for them, they calmed down, and by the time they returned, Mrs. Spier was happy to hear that Mr. Spier was getting regular treatment at a hospital in Long Island.

Now, there are seven of us in the BSC. We're all thirteen and in eighth grade. Our jobs are divided up among us on a case by case basis, since we are mainly baby-sitters in our own homes. The problem is, although we have plenty of jobs, our schedules change. So a club meeting is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in Claudia's room. That's where we meet. We love making sure we have plenty of room, since most of the time we're working the houses we sit for.

Last, but definitely not least, we have another member, Mallory. She lives near my house and we're friends. She's a member of the British Columbia Ring-Ding, and she loves track and swimming. She was
