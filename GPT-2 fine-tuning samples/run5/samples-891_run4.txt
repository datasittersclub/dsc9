======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 five, Logan Bruno (Mrs. Scrooge, who was living with her dad and brother in the house next door to where we now live) and Shannon Kilbourne, who plays Kristy's step-sister, Janine the Shy. (She was adopted.)

What a group of friends. We hardly ever have to see Jessi or Mal together. Even so, we miss each other when we're at our BSC meetings. We're so different from each other that the idea of one is still fresh. Now I know kids I don't even know well.

Jessi Ramsey is my idea of a cool kid. She's totally gorgeous. (You'd never guess she grew up in a house like mine.) She has long blonde hair, blue eyes, and a perfect complexion. (I have to say I’m not as gorgeous as Jessi.) And so does Mal, who wears her long blonde hair in a pony tail. Jessi looks exotic even in her shiny black hair. She’s from a huge family in Connecticut and has almost as much energy about her as Mal does. Jessi’s family consists of her mom and dad; a younger sister, Becca, who is eight; a baby brother, Squirt (Sam); and a Aunt Cecelia who lives with the family.

How did Jessi and Mal meet? It definitely helped. Jessi’s mother plays tennis and likes to boast about it, so the Ramseys got married. Then Mal moved away, too, to California and Jessi’s native family took him in instead.

When Mal wanted to move back to her native home, Jessi and Mal got married and we moved into the Ramseys’ old farmhouse. (You should see the barn there. The barn is called the Meek’s barn, which is why we invited Dawn and me to join.) The house is old and rambling, so many pets that the pets don’t actually come to life. The animals — a Bernese mountain dog, a goldfish, two goldfish, an old cat, and a black Labrador — are all there in the den, too.

Here’s how that happened: Mal (who loves to read horse stories and is the BSC’s color guard) discovered the secret to the den’s charm. She took her daughter, her Aunt Cecelia, and invited them to stay, and they did. So did Kristy (who had always wanted to stay in Kristy’s neighborhood, now that Mal and Jessi were in high school). But Mal went down with it.

By the time Dawn and I returned to California, we were exhausted and in over our heads. We’d been flying all night (and eating worms!) and were just hanging in the den when the phone rang. We opened the record book to Tuesday’s schedule.

We couldn’t wait to get to work.

We wrote down the job information and hung up. Jessi asked if it was free. We said yes and we got to work.

Just as we were finishing up the record book (and all of our junk food), the phone rang. We looked at each other. I looked at Mary Anne and saw she was interested in Dawn’s job. But before I could ask her much more, Bell Davidahns’s digital clock clicked to five-thirty.

“Hello, Baby-sitters Club,” I said.

“Hi, this is Mary Anne, Mrs. Arnold.”

“Mrs. Arnold?” I said.

“Hold her, hold her,” Mary Anne held the door. “We better make it so we won’t get on her bike,” Claudia added.

The conversation suddenly turned to whether Dawn has any special baby-sitting responsibilities. Mary Anne wanted to know if Dawn had any special responsibilities, but we were all just talking about how much it would mean to her.

“Well, I won’t be there,” Mary Anne said with a smile. “I’m sure going on over there would really be helpful.” The other officers gave Mary Anne a kiss and then each whispered something about how much it meant a lot to her.

I knew we were all thinking it was a good idea. But Mary Anne had already planned it. I was sure I would do more shopping (which I did, too) and be able to find the baby-sitters at the Arboretum better.

“Sure,” I said. “When are you going to be there?”

“I’ll be back in about an hour.” (I don’t even know when I�
