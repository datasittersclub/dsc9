 of Mary Anne, she would find a good job at the office of the president, and make the BSC president.” Mary Anne is pretty average. She’s shy, sensitive, and pretty serious sometimes. (She’s the only club member who does a lot of making and coloring.)

Kristy is pretty serious, too, though, which can be best demonstrated by the way she conducts herself. She always makes sure her friends know she is being nice.

Kristy is on the short side and has brown hair and brown eyes. She’s the longest-loved child in the fourth grade, and she spends a lot of her time with her parents when she can. Her other passions are reading science fiction, and children’ softball. She is, well, a sports fanatic.

Her clothes are wild, which, naturally, comes naturally to her. Her favorite clothes (well, her favorite one) are collared sneakers and flared jackets. There are three pairs of T-shirts in her collection. She’s got these super-stylish jumpsuit and she’s got these gigantic blouses and she’s got these great jean shorts.” She’s the one who gets that one outrageous idea one afternoon and does just about anything else to make it through the next week without getting caught.

Mary Anne’s father came home from work that night and looked through her old yearbook. He had a very interesting story to tell. One day his daughter had returned from a trip to Europe and he was looking for some kind of date. When Mary Anne saw pictures of the men she loved, she had the courage to tell him about it. The picture really shocked him, and he said he was a date who was very nice. So he told her all about it and invited her to join him in his club. In fact, after her parents got some work, they asked Mary Anne’s mother to marry Kristy’s dad, who was going to marry her mom. I mean, Kristy could really marry someone. Mary Anne became friends with Kristy, and it worked out for everybody.

Mary Anne has a small role in the club. She’s the club”s treasurer (that’s the secretary), and she has to keep track of the club’s finances and keep tabs on everyone. She is very efficient too, and that’s exactly what makes her great.

In spite of all of that, I think Mary Anne has one more thing on her mind — becoming a model. That’s what makes her a famous model. That’s also what makes her a good club secretary. (I should explain, although the BSC isn’t as organized as the BSC, the President is the BSC’s alternate officer, and the record book is full of helpful hints and hints that can help you out of trouble.)

One of Mary Anne’s great ideas was Kid-Kit. A booklets I read are an awesome way to introduce new baby-sitters to parents. The parents can decorate a box, and then they’re sure the kids will come to their first meeting of a new neighborhood or activity before Christmas.

I would love to be able to take the kids on an exciting trip — to Disneyland — with just my own eyes. Not that I’m that interested in that, mind you. Kid-Kits are boxes — which are really tiny cardboard pallets — filled with various stickers, markers, glue, and fabric paper. The kids can check out their families at that moment.

Let’s see….

One of Mary Anne’s older brothers had returned to his hometown after a long stay in the U.S. He had been staying there temporarily, but his parents had decided to return him immediately after he returned from Europe. Why? In the nick of time. They had made him sign up permanently. Who was the kid in the picture? A grown-up. I’m not sure. He came back for his own family, which was an uncomfortable thing to do, but one could only wonder why his parents were choosing to stay in the country.

Mary Anne was already planning a family reunion with her parents. She wasn’t worried about sitting dates. In fact, I think they weren’t so worried about having a baby that they offered Mary Anne up for adoption. Why? I don’t know yet, but from my personal experience, they are. And Mary Anne has good ears and good posture. Wouldn’t that make her perfect for the Baby-sitters Club?

In other news, Mary Anne’s mom and I are the junior officers of the BSC. Dawn has moved back to California. Now, with her father back in Stoneybrook, Mary Anne
