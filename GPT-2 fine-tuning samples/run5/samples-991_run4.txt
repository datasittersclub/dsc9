======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Even when he was about to baby-sit for the first time, they began talking about what had happened next.

That's when the bad stuff really started. We began fantasizing about Dawn. About her. About how much she meant a world of thuds. (We knew it myself, since Dawn's mom works for a big company.) And about how much we were going to miss Dawn.

I was right about the time Dawn moved to Connecticut from California. We thought it would be a happy ending — but all the talking and plotting just really destroyed us. We realized we needed to begin a temporary truce. And Mrs. Barrett finally found a way to stop all this moaning and complaining.

Fortunately Dawn had a new sister, Grace, who was about to become her own person. Together with Dawn, they'll form a special next-of-kin's baby-sitting organization.

Yes, a super-new group of super-powered people. No one was ever sure, but somehow we managed to make up with them.

Which is why Claudia seemed like the perfect person for headmistress. As vice-president, Claud would function as the vice-president. She could make sure we could meet our needs and keep our hands where they are — hand it out, without having to look for official permission from anyone.

The only problem with Claud's setup is that, although she's a genius (although she may not have been like Robert not long ago, when she had to be cajoled into changing the way she talked about school and the Charlie Hebdo attacks), she has to deal with extremely organized (and sometimes totally stupid) disbursement requests. She collects dues each Monday. (The kids don't really know what dues are, since it's hidden in her hard drive at the bottom of her closet.) That's when she formed the idea for the club.

She realized one of the main problems we have is that we have too many jobs to mention a few — nine vice-president jobs is crazy!

The club meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from five-thirty until six. Our meeting times are official: my phone calls, Robert's two sitting jobs, and the after-school soccer practice. The meetings are very competitive, and our clients aren't really pleased with us (we don't really care much about our marks). So Claudia makes the scheduling decisions for us.

She makes the scheduling decisions for us, and our clients do not. It's the BSC's job to make sure our poor clients know what we're up to.

Since Claud is a math whiz (one of her best qualities), it's easy for her to see the big picture. Also, she's never once in a million years had a client who was happy before they saw a calendar.

That's why we always meet in her room. We never go to the mall or go to the supermarket for makeup. (Claud has to go to the thrift shop or she can't even buy clothes!) She has to make herself available to bargain-basement customers for the rest of us.

As treasurer of the club, I collect dues every Monday. Because we're so old-fashioned (meaning we have time for all sorts of tastes) I get to spend it on things like Claudia's jewelry and snacks, and on things I can afford to buy by searching through my closet. (Plus I keep a box of handmade cordials that I couldn't afford to buy when I was in California!)

Stacey collected dues on Monday. She looked like a taxidermist in a blinder with a razor. Isn't that neat?

Claudia is our vice-president. She acts as our secretary, adding my digital assistant, Stacey. She also keeps track of the club's money. We use the club dues to pay part of my phone bill and to restock Claudia's stash of Kid-Kits. And we use the money to buy papier-mâché earrings for the club.

It's a busy day for the club. But the conversations aren't very, very difficult. We're not too worried about that. We're practically a half-hour late to the BCT meeting. I still have time to chat with Mary Anne before my taxi takes me to my next meeting of the BCT.

“What are you talking about?” said Stacey. “Isn’t it?”

“It’s nothing.” I replied with a smile. “It’s almost impossible. You just have to get to the bottom of it.”

“I wonder how you do it,” said Claudia.

“Having a health problem?” I asked.

“Having diabetes?” said Mary Anne.

I sighed. “You know what
