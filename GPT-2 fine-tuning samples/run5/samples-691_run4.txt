“Can we go?”

There’s a pause. I try to take a single long breath and remember that even with this guy in the locker room, we’re not meant to be in it. “I’m sorry,” I apologize, but it sounds as if I’d give up a lot of my self-confidence if that’s what David Michael was thinking.

“What’s that mean?” he asks. (He doesn’t know me, but I’m in the club and he’s in the club.)

“You’ve already talked to him,” I tell him. “And he knows me, too,” I add hastily.

David Michael doesn’t even look like a surprise to David Michael. He and Kristy Thomas have long hair and glasses and he’s on the small side (he’s tall and almost white), but I think that’s because, well, that’s just Kristy. She’s a big-shot, and I think she thinks Kristy would make a perfect president. (Yes, the ball club was Kristy’s idea, too, but not too well. She hates big-coastal ballerinas and is on trial in New York City. Like, in, like, real life.)

In fact, I’ve already told you that when David Michael was this kid at heart, he was so devoted to the game that even the ticket booth was his special duty. (Which means, in his own blunt way, that he tries to keep things simple.) So, too, often, when Kristy has been a model and now that she’s a grandmother, she’s been involved in ballerining too. As if to say, I better explain that my mom is a real live juggler who rides around on a bike. And guess what? She’s the driving — you guessed it — boyfriend of a former high school sweetheart who is now dating a man named Watson Brewer.

That’s right. Mary Anne’s dad. She married a millionaire. She and Mr. Spier have been getting things going pretty well, but now they both have kids of their own — three boys and a girl — so there’s a real limit to how many they can hold onto. Mrs. Brewer and Watson each lose a baby in a row, although Emily Michelle, Watson’s oldest daughter, just happens to be a famous baby-sitter. Her real name is Watson Brewer, but she’s from Vietnam. She’s a real health-food girl — veggie-and-sugar-free, and she loves health food. Also, Watson is divorced, and his wife is an only child from a previous marriage. Now that is a miracle for Mary Anne, even though she’d always hoped her mom would marry a millionaire like Watson.

“I don’t know!” Mary Anne mumbles. “I’m used to really needing babies-sitters clubs.”

David Michael isn’t particularly interested.

“Hi,” Mary Anne says, twisting to look at me.

“Well, hello, Baby-sitters Club. How was your lesson?”

“Just enough to convince this guy to buy me a new car,” I mouthed.

“I was,” I managed a smile.

“You’re not going to get me out of the car anymore, Mary Anne,” I assured her. “He got a new car!”

“How come he asked you to buy him a car?”

“He just asked me — you know — to give him a new house and I told him I was going to go to college with him and I didn’t get into those things then.”

“He never asked you — never — to give him any of his stuff,” I reminded Mary Anne.

“But he got out his stuff!”

“He got in his way,” I told her.

“Oh, come on, Mary Anne,” I said. “Don’t be so mean.”

“I hate to say it, but ‘bad dreams are usually bad dreams’ is what Mary Anne thinks.

“He actually got his car — his wife —”

“Oh, my lord!”

“I think I saved his life last time!”

David Michael steps forward and takes his
