 S.D., said that her family was devastated when she transferred to Connecticut. Shannon's family, she explained, is like a tornado. Everything goes on at one's pace, and things can get chaotic. (I should have told you that Shannon's mother died when the Thomases were in our neighborhood.)

At the same time, Jessi was pretty miserable, too. She was hiding in her room and on top of everybody else whenever anyone went into her room or anyone else made a call or saw anybody else in her neighborhood. I feel bad for them, and I always do, for some reason. But I do feel bad for Jessi. She does things to people and ends up making us feel guilty just a little bit.

Jessi's sister, Nannie, is an excellent student, but she has a boyfriend, Stace. Jessi's sorority does have several members, none of them officers, but they mainly date old, unruly girls, like meyum.

That's why we have our club notebook, a notebook full of information about all our charges (except for the club secretary, who really, really hates me), plus a list of sitting jobs we're interested in. I'd love to be a mom like that, especially when I'm busy with a steady job.

When it comes to kids (yes, really, as you may know) Jessi's mom used to live in New York City, so her best friend Sam was her first and only baby-sitter in high school. But Jessi moved to Stoneybrook because of her father. (He moved back to New York when Sam was in California for a while, and I'm glad I don't have to repeat myself. I was the only one of us who got married, and we lived next door to each other, in a mansion.)

Jessi grew up in New York City, when her father was still living in Stoneybrook with his mom. Her father went on to be a real estate agent since he married Mrs. Schafer, then a widower (who has two little kids from his first marriage, a boy and a girl). He also got a good job and grew up in a big house, and even though his dad died, he still lived in the house when he was really young. So Jessi is a tomboy.

Jessi wears the same jeans and running shoes everybody else in our class has — jeans (we do not), running shoes, plus undergarments for our boy, Sam.

If you looked at Jessi, you'd see a lot of similarities. Jessi, as you know (and I do), is African-American. She's Japanese-American, and we all adore her.

So there you have it: Mal and Jessi.

So now you know what I think Jessi's like, what my opinion of her is, and how she grew up:

Abby: “You’ll be hard for her, don’t you think?”

Mary Anne: “You know, I don’t think so,” said Mary Anne.

Jessi was born and raised in Stoneybrook, and grew up in New York City. So it’s no surprise that she goes to such a busy school.

Abby is like me. She has long, silky blonde hair, bright brown eyes, and an eye for style — even though most of her other interests are in French and art. She doesn’t care much about clothes or makeup. But she cares about the environment, which is why she coaches an animal-sitting club called the Barrett-DeWitts. (She also coaches a little kid's softball team for his little brother, Tigger, who goes to a rival school.)

Abby is the BSC’s alternate officer. Which means she can take over the duties of anyone’s sitter.

Mary Anne is a tomboy. She’s thirteen, and she’s in sixth grade, which means she’s good at school.

However, Mary Anne’s best friend is Stacey McGill, who is eleven. Stacey is Mary Anne’s best friend, too, so naturally they’re like brothers and sisters. And they are alike. Stacey is eleven (she is a very talented ballet student! She’s on the short side, which, by the way, is another category for tall). While Mary Anne and Stacey are thirteen and in eighth grade, they’re both in sixth grade. Stacey can’t take ballet lessons, but she attends the French school she always goes to.

And, as you may know, Stacey’s family is poor, and her father’s house — which was built in 1795 — is a
