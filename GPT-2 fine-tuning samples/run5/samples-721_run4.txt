======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 BBS’s dance at SMS, and she’s a terrific baby-sitter. You should see her dance. You can see her legs. You can see her face. And you can tell she’s beautiful, too.

But Claudia is also a knockout, with long, golden-blonde hair that reaches halfway down her back and deep, dark, brown eyes (Claudia is Japanese-American).

But Dawn is … she’s … different. Not like Stacey or Mal, she’s not a member of the BSC, although it’s a handful, and she’s not a divorced parent, but a divorced woman, too. Now, let’s see. Who is she? Who’s she? Who is she different from the rest of us?

Here are the other BSC members:

Abby Stevenson (Flyers, BSC “Flyer,” the newest member was the first of us to join the club). Abby is originally from here, and is a ballerina who takes classes all over the place and has already danced several professional productions. She has pale blue eyes and a beautiful, very exotic complexion.

Mal and I are the newest members of the BSC, and we are very pleased to be able to begin dues-paying. It’s a simple, regular, convenient service — baby-sitting, baby-sitting for eight hours a day, seven days a week, weekdays — and it comes with dues of dues plus an on-call room rate. I can’t believe I hate the BSC now, but the days get busy.

If I were going to spend any kind of amount on a baby-sitting service a second time, it’s probably earm-hmm, that I must have said: earm-hmm. I could read your mind, even if I wanted to, because I am in charge of my own brain, the BSC Record book. You’d be amazed at how thorough and complete the record-keeping is. Claudia is responsible for keeping track of our clients’ addresses, phone numbers, allergies, special allergies, and so forth. She writes down the names, phone numbers, the wages earned, plus the important information about our clients: the addresses and phone numbers of our baby-sitting charges, their children’s ages, and so forth. Then she has to check to see that all of our clients are available to take baby-sitting jobs.

The record book has never been more difficult than it is. Claudia has never made a mistake.

As treasurer of the BSC, I have the greatest job. I’m in charge of all the money that’s thrown our way. Some of the money goes for club expenses, such as part of Claudia’s allowance for Kristy’s dog, Margo, and for club plane tickets to conferences in Paris. If there’s anything left over after expenses, it goes toward Claudia’s phone line (her official BSC phone line).

Dawn, my other best friend, has a steady job. She’s on a publishing and advertising agency in Stamford, which is a little outside the Big Apple. She used to belong to the BSC, but we were all snobby about Claudia’s phone call and her late arrival date on our meetings. Dawn claims she made some kind of bigoted remark in a BSC meeting, but it doesn’t amount to anything but gross ignorance. (Most of us treat her like a little girl.) Dawn and I aren’t perfect people. Some of the people I’ve mentioned so far are jerks, but we are equals. We’re pretty close, in fact. We have a lot in common, such as the clothes we wear and the way we dress. But even we’re different, besides personality, we’re sensitive. Especially Dawn, who’s the shyest, most sensitive of us. I bet you’re thinking that shy girls can just barely be called “stirpies” (meaning, they aren’t interested in clothing differences).

Surfing at the BSC (and other sports, too) is like riding a wave. You feel it when a girl or a boy is touching; you feel it when they’re not touching. But you also feel it when a person is touching. And you know it when you see it.

Just at our meetings we take baby-sitting jobs from people who have recently moved to town. We don’t pick up when we’re busier. We take job after job, week after week. We get jobs from bored sitters who don’t have any job to go to. So
