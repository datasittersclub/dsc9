======== SAMPLE 1 ========
erson is from New York City, and she’s the BSC’s alternate officer, which means she has to take over whatever jobs are taken over by her if the club is to run anymore jobs in the future.

Mary Anne’s father left the club when she was just a baby, and Mary Anne’s mother left, too. She’s in the midst of a great move to California, one that was only accelerated by Dawn’s divorce and Jeff’s move.

Dawn is an eighth-grader and a California girl. She’s a real individual and, as Dawn points out, she’s not afraid to try out lots of different styles. Mary Anne thinks of it as if you were herding sheep around on her own.

Since Dawn doesn’t think of herself as an individual, Mary Anne’s been kind of like a dollhouse for her father. Then, one day, when Mr. Spier was having trouble raising a child (which he’s had to do without me — a stepdad?!), Mr. Spier fell madly in love with this guy who was a lot like him and whom he adored. And he married Dawn’s mother. Mary Anne had a brief but very special time with both of them.

Just then Mr. Spier was in hot pursuit of Mary Anne, Dawn decided to move into the house Jeff had bought for her the year before which he had grown out on Mary Anne and him.

Mary Anne shivered. “So?” she whispered.

“Yes!” replied Dawn as she ran into the room. “I think I’ll stay with my other friends. It’s a nice house just off Arnold Court. It has a great view of the surrounding hills and lots of houses. I could do it myself — just walk across the street.”

I burst out laughing. “What did you say you’d do?”

“You can just walk across them, right?”

“Uh-huh … okay … yeah … yeah.”

I’m good with words and a great baby-sitter. I didn’t care what happened between Dawn and Mary Anne. I cared what everybody had done — and it just worked out. There weren’t that many parents to make that choice, though. Just one or the other, right? So far, I’d held it up. But now it was something more. “You made it,” I said, “and I hope you like some of the houses you visit.”

“I’ll make it, you go,” replied Dawn with a smile.

“It’s a nice house, Mary Anne,” I went on. “Anyone want a picture of it?”

“Sure,” replied Mary Anne.

“I could pick one up in the museum,” I said with a smile. “You can pick one up at the library.”

We watched as Dawn took the picture with a big, sharpened-sharpened camera in her hand, and Mary Anne took the pictures that were taken with her phone in the cradle. All right, everyone looks nice, but I think a picture can get much, much more interesting if you take one look at the people you visit.

One of them is Mrs. Mancusi. She’s the mother of one of the kids we baby-sit for, and her great-aunt came to live with us. We invited Mrs. Mancusi to become a new family now known as the Mancusis. She did just that, and Mrs. Mancusi was great-natured and sensitive.

But there’s one thing you never know when you meet her.

“She said if you visit any of my old friends, we might see what they wanted — and, oh, they might even want to help you.”

“Exactly,” I said. “That’s Mr. Mancusi. He told us all to hold our family together … and that if we weren’t with you, there wouldn’t be enough money for the things you buy. He said parents would be able to take care of one kid for free. Hmph.”

“Exactly,” said Mal together with her hands. “Mr. Mancusi said parents would be able to get a grip on the children. He said they’d be rich. The Mancusis have three kids, all other siblings, and maybe one younger one.”
