 or’s father walked out on her family, leaving Mrs. Thomas with two kids, three-and-a-half, and her husband. (Boy, did I miss that exchange.) After the divorce, Mary Anne met this other woman, Dawn Schafer, who had moved to California and became an L.A. double professional. (You want to know the details? See.) Then Mary Anne and Dawn both moved back to Stoneybrook because the Schafers’ real home had been in California. (That’s great, doesn’t it?) By then the family had become so overloaded with activity that it was taking on a whole new meaning. So, guess who was assigned to take Mary Anne’s place?

Well, Mary Anne became club secretary, then adopted two other girls from the BSC, Jessi Ramsey and Mallory (Mary Anne’s younger sister), and Mary Anne decided she still wanted to have something to do, such as eat at the Kwanzaa’s, not dinner. Whew! So her parents were very understanding about the decision. (After the divorce, Dawn moved back to Stoneybrook, and they’re in the process of becoming our new clients.) When Dawn and Mary Anne met each other, they realized they’d also grown close. We don’t call them bloodlines, but each of them grew since they were both girls.

Claudia’s another one of our two younger sisters. In fact, Claud is the oldest of the BSC baby-sitters. And there’s nothing worse than you have to be the oldest to get into a club, and you have to be in the process of becoming one. My friends and I try very hard not to let Claud get caught up in too much of that. The BSC, she thinks, is for girls. I know she’s right. But Claud insists it is for her.

What does Claud mean? She is the BSC president, as well as the brains behind every important (and very important) project we run on our clients. What she really means is “challenge” (or “t challenge,'). In other words, she wants to be the next Kristy. Unfortunately, her attempts at “challenge” have practically been a disaster. She’s a tomboy, she is short (5′4) and with her brown hair, she’s athletic and a little over-protective.

So, naturally, the BSC members we sit for try hard to be the best friends we can be. (Which, as you might guess, sometimes we have a problem with. For instance, not long ago, Mary Anne Spier started teasing Kristy about having to date this guy, who she’d dated all her life.) But Kristy is as stubborn as Claud. And Mary Anne insists that she and Claud date — and they even go their separate ways sometimes.

And they do. But when it comes to Mary Anne Spier, the whole point of the BSC is to help each other is to “do’ what’s right for you.” As it turns out, that’s what Mary Anne’s dream of becoming a lawyer’s mother was — to become a pro bono mother.

I should explain some more about how the club works. It is organized like a business, with officers, officers, a secretary, and a secretary’s assistant. Mary Anne enters dues money into the club record book, which she keeps up-to-date. Stacey collects all our money, and Claudia keeps the dues. Whoever earns her the dues (and who doesn’t spills the beans) is responsible for paying Claudia’s phone bill. And everyone has to do with paying our club dues. The dues are important, especially the money we earn, so it’s a big hit.

We also have a treasury, which is in our treasury, too. The treasury is divided up among us so that once in a while there’s enough money for a baby-sitter to buy a used car, or a toy, or even food for the entire family. And although we don’t always need surplus food, there should be enough for our treasury, so Dawn and Mary Anne get to keep items for Kid-Kits, which are boxes full of games, toys, and things for little kids to play with. And of course there’s a pizza party, too. We all keep a surplus of it, since we’re busy keeping the treasury working.

When we meet in Claudia’s room, it’s practically a party. You can tell from the way the three of us work that Claudia is the trendiest, most sophisticated person in the room. She has curly
