 is a woman's symbol of femininity. Her hair and skin are always beautiful. Also she has pierced ears (yes, I can hear her ears), and she wears bright green jewelry around her earbuds.

Mary Anne is a natural woman with long legs and light brown eyes. She has a big family, with her two older brothers, Charlie (25) and Sam (21), and her younger, sister-in-law, Karen Karen. Also, her best friend and neighbor, Nancy Hill, lives with Mary Anne and her family.

Mal — who will not answer phone calls, but who can be reached from the far corners of New York City — is a good friend of Kristy's. He's like her ghost, with black hair, dark brown eyes, and a big mouth. He's also a super-bunch of fun-loving kids I suppose, but that's not the main reason I like my friends so much. For one, you could get the feeling my boyfriend could be a killer killer killer. Kristy has always been a good boyfriend for me. That's why the BSC was born. Not that I was not a good boyfriend for Kristy, but she kept giving me weird looks in my room. (I didn't care.) Kristy is pretty smart, and I suppose she would like to be a genius if she could be a good boyfriend for her. I mean, Kristy is smart if you ask me, although maybe I should introduce her to math. She's the only one of us in the BSC with a college degree. If you ask, she's smart as the stars are high and her parents are happy. I don't mean she won't give up, but Kristy is very generous. She has a private school, a private school secretary, and a private school tutor. (She does like sports, too, but sometimes she doesn't realize how lucky she is.) Not long ago she became the president of the Club, and she has since become one of the club's most important members.

Jessi, on the other hand, is smart as usual because of Kristy's mom, her younger brothers, and her aunt. She has brownish hair, and dark skin, and a big family. She grew up in New York City, which is where Kristy is from. That made her more accepting of her hometown (which she shares). But once she moved back there, the problems in Kristy's life became more challenging. For one thing, she grew up in California, had to attend Stoneybrook Middle School as a newcomer, and has asthma. That made her a target for bullies and has kept her away from Kristy ever since. For another thing, she has diabetes. If I had the option of trying to become a diabetic myself (for example, I do), the BSC would have become an animal.

But Jessi's mom has always been strict about her health. (I've met her and she's been strict at times. That's not Kristy's fault. She's like my neighbor — just the opposite. She just wants to be happy, to live in her neighborhood, not worrying around, and to have a good diet.) For Jessi, though, the BSC was about making friends, and it was Kristy who decided to get married.

Here in New York City, Kristy lives next door to Mary Anne and goes to Stoneybrook Day School. Kristy and Mary Anne are best friends, you would think. But they aren't. They're best friends because when they are, they're not totally different from each other, either. Unlike Kristy, though, these two are much alike in many ways. Both men and women alike, in fact, and in their own way. They like each others' company a lot. And the only thing I have to say about them is that they're alike in a certain way and in a certain way of dress. It's all pretty different, but I think it's healthy to think of them as two types of people. They're both alike in a way.

"Aye, aye!" Jessi giggled. "I just got a new boyfriend — this guy I met earlier."

"Really?" asked her boyfriend, Joe.

"I was kind of worried, a lot. I was just taking my hair back," said Jessi.

"What's wrong, Jessi?" asked her dad.

"I just got a new boyfriend. This guy was talking to me at my house. It was the night before he got home. It's funny, the one who gets home early, but he's only at my house because he's in England, and I'm gone. He's pretty good. I've known him since I was fifteen, but I haven't seen him lately, either. He's like a ghost."

I guess it's probably a shame that they couldn't meet
