 to one of our meetings.”

“I don’t believe a word she says,” said Stacey.

Rrrrrring!

“Aye, I — ’reserve one,” I said.

“You don’t have to …”

“No, but I prefer …”

We were in the middle of making a zillion entries. As I said before, it was my turn.

“Okay, listen carefully. Most of these entries are very, very small, and some are quite long, so that even a small dentist can sometimes notice a little something about a person.”

I knew I was getting ahead of myself.

The idea struck me.

Maybe, just maybe, it should come as a surprise that the best dentist in the world has never, ever, had to pay a single visit to the dentist chair.

I thought back to the day I said “This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club will be about time,” and that somehow this was the perfect time to announce that we would be having our very first Baby-sitter Club meeting that day.

That was all I could think about.

The meeting never really stopped, though. We always seemed more interested in keeping people talking than in making sure our clients met their commitments.

Which made me feel better all the time.

“Anyway, listen carefully,” I said, putting my leaf out, “this is … very … … not good.”

“Well,” said Stacey. “The meeting might be over,” she added thoughtfully.

I pulled my appointment information from the record book, which was what our club did most of the time.

It was this:

Table of contents

The Baby-sitters Club (BSC) is one of the oldest, most complicated, most successful, most successful baby-sitting projects in the world. We've always had a good idea, but never really tested it. The one thing we have in common is the idea of parents being able to arrange for a sitter.

We all have in common. We've all helped take some of the baby-sitting on our own. And, boy, were we grateful to some people for bringing us together.

Mary Anne Spier has been my best friend since she was a kid. She's also the secretary of the BSC, which means she holds the important job of alternating between the sitting and the calling. She's very organized. We meet in her room because she's the only member who has her own phone, with a private line. We call to take baby-sitting jobs at other members' houses. Pretty neat, huh?

Actually, it has more to do with her mom's strong-willed nature than that. See, Mary Anne's mom died when Mary Anne was really little. Just like Mr. Spier did not want to send him off to college in the name of being tough. So now he has to send me off to Kent, along with his other best friend, Logan.

Mary Anne also used to live right across the street from me. But right after her mom died, just before school started, Mary Anne became more independent. Now she visits her dad, and Sharon has moved out to California, where she used to live (with her mom and her older brother, David Michael, who are divorced).

Mary Anne and Sharon have lived in the house since Richard left. Before Richard had left, Sharon had brought her brothers and brothers along for sitting. Richard didn't have a central number, but one central, reliable, guy. Who knew? When David Michael walked out on his family, Sharon suggested he go to Sea City. Who would he be? Who were the other BSC members? Mary Anne answered, “We could join the club,” and that’s what we do.

“Wow!” exclaimed Logan, grinning. “I bet you guys thought of that before David Michael did.”

“I love that game,” I said brightly. “I bet you guys thought it was going to be competitive.”

“No. It is,” said David Michael, giggling. “No, it’s more like a sports game than a soccer game.”

Before you could say it was a great idea, I had just finished telling you about Sea City and the BSC as a whole and of course had finished telling you about the Baby-sitters Club.

“Welcome to the BSC,” I announced. “Come join us,” I added, heading toward the door. Our meeting has
