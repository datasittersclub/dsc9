 known from the time she first moved to Stoneybrook from Manhattan. That was when Dawn Kilbourne, who is my neighbor and best friend, moved into the neighborhood.

After we got used to our new neighbors, Dawn finally called Mr. and Mrs. Springer back. They asked us to join them and since we were new friends and neighbors, they were pretty bold with us. Unfortunately, all the activity stopped and they turned against each other in the meetings. Then Dawn managed to convince Mr. Springer to return Dawn and Mary Anne to Connecticut. But Mary Anne never did. She returned to Stoneybrook but Dawn decided she felt she needed to return to California to finish high school. Before she could, she fell and ended up in a real car accident.

Stacey McGill moved back to Stoneybrook and is one of my two best friends. (Don't get me wrong, my friendships aren't boring.) She's a math whiz. But when we were in junior high, she just had to take Math in class. Every day. She's a dedicated student of Stoneybrook University. She's not even the only one who enjoys math.

How does Stacey handle stuff like that? Well, she keeps us posted on her schedule and tells us what's happening in the school halls. If anyone has a math lesson but doesn't see us on time, she'll call us as soon as it's necessary. We always pay dues to her. If we're late we have to replace snacks.

Our treasurer is Stacey. She collects our dues every Monday and puts the money in a big manger. Then she’s in charge of the club notebook. Since there’s no regular sitting time for the notebook to read, we’re required to write up every single job we go on so that everyone knows what’s going on. Once a week the club pays Charlie Thomas and me to drive Kristy to meetings. There’s even money for me to have fun with the kids we coach, Kristy’s Krushers.

The club’s theme song can be heard every week during meetings. That’s because our club has to sing that tune every Monday. (The Krushers are great.) The kids at Stacey’s are usually in sixth grade (they’re the main starters) but they’re better off if they skip the lulls. And it’s great to be a part of something fun.

Stacey moved here from New York recently and the BSC’s office is in her place. The club’s official headquarters is that of the president’s mansion, which was built before Kristy’s parents divorced. The house is huge and has been for years. The mansion now has an updated look since Kristy’s mother sold the family home and moved in. The old valet parking lot with its pool, gym, and horse barn has been razed to make way for a new park. And Kristy’s room is getting awfully crowded — every other day you’ll find four or five family members gathered in her room, eating and talking, reading, and stuffing themselves into a very cute new miniskirt. It’s disgusting.

“Kristy, I feel so dirty,” I said. “Maybe I should have gone to the movies with you,” I added, patting her on the back for keeping track of us.

“I think I better,” Kristy said, “before I feel dirty.”

“Well, you have to have a dirty toothbrush?” she asked. “Do you have a smell in your room?”

She’s right, of course I’m dirty. She’s right about my mother and father. But do I have to? I could look good in that thong-thin plastic bag perched on my room wall. (I used to think that was a manila envelope, but it’s still a lot of stuff.)

“Well,” I said. “You’re in charge.”

“Chief,” Kristy answered. “Chief …”

“I’ll tell you what I see.” Claudia said.

“Okay,” Kristy replied. “I’m the one who makes the appointment, Mary Anne.”

“I was just curious,” Stacey McGill interjected. “How is the club going?”

“Good afternoon,” Claudia said briskly. “I’ll call you back, Mary Anne.” She grabbed a clipboard and began writing. “Claudia, you’re
