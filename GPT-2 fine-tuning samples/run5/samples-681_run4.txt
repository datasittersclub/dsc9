 me because our club’s called “Kristy’s racket”.

Kristy comes from a large family. She has seven younger brothers and sisters, three of which are identical triplets (boys). With seven brothers and sisters, she’s a real take-charge, live-thrus girl (she’s got seven brothers and sisters). Kristy also has a great big mouth, despite her long life.

When she was little, you couldn’t help thinking that “everyone’s unique,” but that never changed. Kristy is a genuine take-charge star, someone who puts the finishing touches on things right before they happen.

You wouldn’t be surprised to hear that she’s always having fun. For example, I’d have to say that she’s always had a big mouth and beaded red coooooooow clothing (she likes bright colors, too). She even has a big smile, which she is always wearing sophisticated way (yuck).

Now, those are my friends in the BSC. But the ones I really admire are Mallory and Jessi, our junior officers. Their parents don’t allow their firstborns to ride on other people’s stomachs. So when both their parents send their own kids (Mal and Jessi, who are of two minds about eating cheese fries), we really have to keep them company. Mellow and chunky, and with great belles (or rhinoceros tails).

Mallory is the oldest of nine brothers and sisters. She’s got seven of her own and two younger brothers, David Michael (who is seven when I first met him) and Sam, who is the oldest of four (so are the rest of us). She’s a real live wire — smart, witty, and allergic to just about everything. Can’t stop complaining about her nose and mouth, or about her clothes (she’s got really wild-eyed clothes), or about how she feels whenever her parents touch each other, or about how she doesn’t like kids, or about her hair (it’s really short). Well, the rest of us don’t have to bother with that. Besides, she’s our alternate officer, which means she can take over the duties of any other officer if anyone happens to be out sick.

As I’ve told you, Mallory and Jessi have a lot in common, but they aren’t quite as creative as I’d have them be.

Jessi’s a ballet dancer. (That’s Mal’s real name and it means “Way to Tall for Ballet.) She’s had some pretty dramatic lives. She met and married a really rich guy named Watson Brewer in high school. They got married, and their family moved into the coolest old barn on Oakley Road.

We all groaned at the sound of Charlotte singing, “Come on, you are wild!” Mallory pulled a blanket over her head and wrapped her arms around it, then started jumping around and around, and “Who’s the coolest person in school?”

When I said cool I meant all these other words I’d heard before — “Claudia’s got it, Mallory thinks so. She’s got it in her to excel in whatever she wants to do and Claudia to be a terrible student. Claudia thrives on this. She manages almost the full complement of French and math in school.

Jessi has dark, curly hair and is the shortest girl in our class. She’s not concerned about her looks: she’s an only child. She has glasses and braces (she’s got them, too, thanks to Stacey McGill). She’s petite, like me, with big brown eyes and medium height brown skin. And, as you know, her dream is to be a children’s book author and illustrator someday.

I think Jessi has it all, that she’d want to be a prima ballerina, but she can’t get away from ballet because her parents are a little jealous of her — which of course Jessi’s parents disapprove of.

“I could do ballet at school,” Jessi told me. “But that’s a year before eighth grade. I could do it in Connecticut.”

“Yeah,” I said. “It could be in New York City,” I went on. “I don’t know if that’s worth it, but —”

“If Connecticut is a city,” Mallory
