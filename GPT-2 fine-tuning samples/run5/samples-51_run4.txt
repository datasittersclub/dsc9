 to a person if I have to.

Stacey? That was a dumb question. I asked her about her dad, and she said, "You know, if you had to, I could."

She did. She asked, in an even worse way, if he had told me about him and said, yes, he would. The conversation then continued for a long time. Then it got to me and it went straight to my phone. At first it was funny, because I was totally out of my mind in such short order. But then it was very good and I just figured out about what my dad did and when.

I tried to find another dad for Emily, but it wasn't possible. It was too easy, I thought. I had to guess, and I wasn

going to think again. I had to call one phone number so I was on my own. At least I knew what I wasn't missing.

So I went to my phone and talked to one phone number and called two numbers. I met the phone number on the map next and met up on the rest of the line to find Emily. After about ten minutes, I decided to sit on Emily's right (which was right behind her), because I knew I had to get the phone to the right number first….

"Emily, the telephone is missing," I said.

Emily was right, though, because I had to figure out exactly where the call came from. I was already waiting for the phone as usual. It looked very slow, and not very organized.

"Emily, the phone is missing!" I announced.

"What?" Emily exclaimed.

"I saw the phone call," I finally said.

I wasn't sure how to respond. I was confused for a second. But I didn't want to sound like I was playing up a story that wasn't worth listening to. Luckily, I could answer my number and get to another line (that was on my map, too). Then I could finally make sense of what had happened.

"Hi, Mrs. Long?" I piped up.

"Yes, Mr. Long! Hello, the phone's missing. Would you mind helping me find it?"

I made a face. "Hi, Mrs. Long," I said. I was wearing a turtleneck sweater, white baseball cap, and green jeans. I was wearing a yellow sweatshirt and a green T-shirt. I had just got my hair pulled back and I was wearing a high school sweater for my junior year.

"Hi, Mrs. Long, I just ran across the school hall. I saw your phone call. Oh, no, the phone is missing. It was just a minute ago, and we're still on call. I need more help."

I smiled.

"But, if you look right into the picture, the phone number is just right in the middle of Mrs. Long's bedroom. It's a secret. I told you I was looking forward to reading about it. That said, I couldn't help but be taken by the feeling of mystery running through my head. It was very hard to believe. But let me tell you, when I read about it, it just made me believe.

“What, do you have to get the phone back?" Anna asked.

"I can't. It’s not there. It’s on my left.”

"I’ll be glad to do it," I said. "But I’ll take a picture or something, as soon as I see it."

I checked each photo up, and I saw it was on Emily's phone. It had a picture of Emily dressed so she’d never show it. I could tell that she was nervous. I wanted to be sure.

Mary Anne, it was clear, and the voice was Mary Anne as she listened.

“The phone, I know —”

“The phone, I know —”

“The phone, it could be the same number." I raised an eyebrow.

“Yes, it’s," the voice repeated.

“Hi, you’re right," I answered.

”No, not this time. See, I need to help with my homework. Then I would be more organized, so I could look for answers faster. Maybe it would bring more attention to the case against me.

“I want to think about it more then.” She said with a smile. “So I have to look for my mom tomorrow. We need me for the week. I can't wait to hear it from her."

It was great. The phone was right again, and the picture was still on my phone.

“Uh-
