 They are sooooo different. I can’t call Stacey’s outfits “unique” or “extremely”interesting. Anyway, Stacey has these dark, almond-shaped eyes and these long, shiny, silky, brown hair. She’s short for her age — which is thirteen instead of two — but she’s got this really nice, American air about her. Stacey’s hair is curly and brown and pretty; she likes bright colors. And her outfit choice: a vest with a belt or some combination of the two, a purple crisscross skirt with great purplish blisters under it, and a great white turquoise hat with a little sparkly purplish dot in the middle. The turquoise is a pretty cool quality, too, I guess, especially for a thirteen-year-old girl.

But of course Stacey has had very healthy, adult life. Her parents, who used to be strict with her, snapped up Stacey when she was in seventh grade. Then they bought her a house and moved her there — on her own — until she was married again. That was when the whole BSC — Stacey, Claudia, and Kristy had come to Stoneybrook. We all stayed there until Dawn moved away, but Kristy finally joined the club.

One member left us, and we were the ones to confirm it. Abby Stevenson. Everyone’s photo.

Who are you? Kristy, Claudia, or not?

Well, Kristy is probably best known for her artwork class she took this summer at the Museum of Modern Art. We thought the same thing would happen to her — that her school would lose its cool and become bigots. Well, maybe Bigots for Kristy, if it existed at all, she’s right. The class didn’t go as planned, and I’m glad the pizza party went a little too far. I like Kristy quite a bit.

Okay, I admit it. I’m biased.

The problem with that?

Too biased. I mean, Kristy isn’t just opinionated and acts cool, she’s a real, true genius with a real head (can you imagine?). You have to spend some time talking to her (Kristy doesn’t come to the meetings, she just goes on a tangent). She has this inner strength I haven’t seen in Kristy — something that even I felt jealous of when I first heard about her. But then …

Panting!

Coming to class! “Phew! I’ll get to school! Pop! Pop!” exclaimed Jessi Ramsey, my best friend on the BSC.

Panting! Packing!

Jessi and I were gathered together again, but this time it was about a book, not a fight. I was reading Nancy Drew: The Mystery of the Heart, which is about as good as it gets. On top of the mystery, there’s the book itself, which contains two hidden CD-ROM discs and two cassette players. It was a nightmare.

Panting was our cue to get outside, but Kristy was nudging us toward the door.

She climbed the steps next and came down the stairs.

Suddenly, all hell broke loose. Chaos broke out of the shadows and windows above us and led directly into school. The fight was so bad that our parents decided to forbid us to see the movie, The Black Album. (Kristy is the BSC vice-president, mainly because she’s the only one of us who has a private phone line.)

Fortunately, Claudia Kishi, our vice-president, managed to escape (she’s in my room, after all). That means we have plenty of business talking about The Black Album as we prepare to take the train to Manhattan (which is where our set and the movie are set).

But this isn’t the only place we can be there. There are also lots of clubs and events we can attend. Clubs and parties are always a little more complicated than Kristy and me, and I was glad to be there when I arrived.

As I was going upstairs, I heard someone calling his friends “Dumb Doodlers!” (Which they were calling, again, in their own nick). “This meeting will come to order!” yelled Kristy, who is the president of the BSC.

“Dumb doodlers! I called to order,” said Stacey McGill, who is the vice-president. “Any business?” She passed the fliers and signed them.

“Dues day!” I said.

A few people showed up. Everyone had
