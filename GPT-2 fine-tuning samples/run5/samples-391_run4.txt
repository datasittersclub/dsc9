 a great idea. Mr. and Mrs. Spier invented a baby-sitting service for their two older kids, and they're doing great. Parents call us during meeting times and say they've been helping their kids. There are already two such stores in Stoneybrook.

But the biggest, best idea of all is Kristy's. She wants to start a company that helps poor people who need sitters. She says her passion is hospitality. As secretary of the BSC, she always takes a lot of the work out of the job when it comes to hospitality (the holidays).

Kristy had a lot of energy for the BSC in her old age, but those days are behind her. Kristy has longish, straight brown hair and brown eyes, and she's a strongwoman. She cries at baby-sitting meetings, and she cries at dinner time too. When I call her Mom, she immediately rues being the oldest in her family, and takes me everywhere when I'm really young. Why can't she be the oldest one at the same time? Kristy answers, simply, that she feels older than anyone I know. I still hear that phrase, though. Kristy loves kids and loves to give lots of them away. Sometimes she ends up in our club.

How about you, Young Mrs. Brewer, my best friend? Would you be so kind as to take Kristy on an extended vacation to California, meet someone else who has had a good vacation, and have a stroke of luck at the stroke of Christmas?

Kristy would be the answer. She's as cool and sensitive and full of personality and love as Kristy is short and quiet. She loves sports and just about everything, from baby-sitting to ballet. You can tell from her uniform, or the way she dresses and the way she eats, that she's a natural at heart.

Kristy has the shortest, strongest, most graceful figure, and she has a great soul. You wouldn't think that about her. Her family consists mostly of her two older brothers and her stepdad. Also her stepsister, Karen.

It's true. Kristy's mom and stepdad were so far apart that Mrs. Spier wasn't sure she could bring herself to get a new baby-sitter. So she went overboard, including having Dawn (our two-year-old stepsister) come to live with her whenever she needs extra time. But no matter, there's still so much to be loved about their families. Here are the things that keep them together: (1) they're close, (2) they're both petite physically (although Kristy is taller), and (3) they both love to baby-sit.

Here's how. Kristy's best friend, Stacey, is very small. Her height is natural, with sandy beaches or sandy mountains or sandy castles. Her hair is long and curly, and she wears funky clothes â€” jeans and a turtleneck or sweater over a turtleneck and cowboy boots. It's possible to see that Kristy is happiest when wearing this sort of clothing. (She's also the only club member with pierced ears, so I guess this is why she's always wearing cowboy boots.)

She can wear whatever she wants and still be incredibly fashionable. You'd never mistake her for a fashion outpoint.

Her best friend is Vanessa. She's short and has brown hair and brown eyes. And if I had to do a list of things I would say she would wear most of the time, which is why she sits in such a trendy dresser.

Vanessa lives with her parents and her younger sister, Anna. Her grandmother Cecelia died when Vanessa was a baby. You see, her mother had raised Vanessa very, very carefully and with a little help from her three older brothers (Charlie, Sam, and David Michael). Vanessa's mother even told her to try something different. For instance, Vanessa may spend her days knitting or playing with little-kids, or playing with dolls or something. But Vanessa is not strict with her. Not lately, though. She's been kind of quiet and quiet and quiet lately.

Take Claudia. She's president of the BSC, and the mother of our other member, Janine. Janine is also sort of a baby without Janine. If your heart were a little heavier, you'd think Janine would have more of a southern accent. Of course, she really sounds like Janine. She's on the southern side of the color red. It's also striking how well her English sounds. She's not like Janine, who's very much an individualist. I think she's less like her, since her soul is in clothes with colors that stand out.

Take Mallory. You'd never guess that a boy named Nicky would wear a different kind of shirt or pants or sweater and wear something called a
