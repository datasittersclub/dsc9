 made her way down the stairs of her house with her two older brothers John and Charlie. Kristy was going to be gone till about five-fifteen.

Once upon a time, that was when Kristy lived. A little more than a century ago, Mrs. Thomas married Watson Brewer, this divorced, balding millionaire. He met the woman he fell in love with when he met Miss Brewer a few years later, and the Thomases moved back to Stoneybrook together. Before long, Kristy's family had grown to include Watson's great-aunt Karen, plus their baby brother, a stepfather, a stepsister named Watson's two older step-siblings, and a dog (Cheeseburger Buddy), plus assorted pets, plus a houseful of other assorted add-ons.

Which is lucky, because Kristy, a really talented musician, has performed in some shows with some really great material. In fact, she once performed what was probably her last show as an instrument. I mean, she played the lead in one of her old material on the radio show her father made for kids. It's called the piano piece and was one of Kristy’s songs. But what a performance it was. The audience had to have seen it. It was fantastic. And Kristy herself said “Wow! It’s very moving.”

And that’s where the similarities end. Kristy is short. She’s from a big family, and it was big family. My mom died when Kristy was a baby. She lived with the Thomases, their two older brothers, her stepfather (whom we don’t — don’t talk about that — Dr. Johanssen, this stuff you don’t put in supermarkets, I won’t tell you — cough syrup — but Kristy will — tell you that — it’s called a sneeze), her mom, her dad (who we don’t name, but that is, anyway), her little sister, and her aunt Cecelia, also known as Pumpkin.

My mom’s house is sort of crowded now, sort of, because Kristy lives for reading and writing and stuff. But the best books are out there, and the restaurants in their neighborhood are known for having “Crunchy Ranchers on Wednesdays.” And that, I guess, is what Kristy is all about — and she’s the best,” (she is the best, after all.)

Kristy is not a tomboy, and she does not care much what other people think of her. It’s just that she doesn’t much care one way or another. She has this big mouth and very strong opinions, and that is why she gets to be Mrs. Handelsblier of the BSC.

Kristy’s best friend, Claudia, is vice-president of the BSC because we hold our meetings in her room. But not only does Claudia have her own phone, but she has her own secretary too, too. I wonder how long that would be, and if anybody could do anything with it!

I was glad to see Claudia again this year, because at that very moment I felt like crying my bedroom.

Claudia is the BSC’s vice-president. Every now and then we need a sitter. Claudia can’t do it all herself, just by herself. This year she’s enlisted Stacey McGill, who is an associate member of the BSC. (Stacey has taken some classes, too, but she’s used to paying dues and usually doesn’t have much to do other than work on club business.) Last year the girls needed two sitters — and neither one was very popular. So Claudia got the job of covering for her older sister, Janine, who’d moved back to the East.

How does Claudia do so many jobs? She does it well enough, I guess, but in a very creative way. Claudia likes advertising and has been doing it well in some ways, but mostly in a creative way during her life. If you ask me, advertising has always been one of Claudia’s few three passions. And no, her parents don’t approve of it. They don’t approve of Stacey, either, though, so Claudia keeps it to herself. And she tries her hardest to be as original as possible. We call her Claud.

Sometimes it’s easy to see that Claudia’s creative nature comes from this deep heart (as you can imagine). She’s a real individual and very much a part of the BSC. Like me, she has an original soul. And like my dad, she misses her older sister a lot. When she was a baby, her
