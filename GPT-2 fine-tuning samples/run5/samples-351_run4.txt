======== SAMPLE 1 ========
’t get to hear her own story — or about her father, or about Tigger or anything else. But I do get to have a good time listening to all that.

“Okay,” Kristy said, putting the book on the shelf for the rest of her family to see. Then she said “Well, Mrs. Schafer passed away a long time ago,” before she could say more. (Maybe it was because she had lost her father, but I don't know.)

When I read the last few sentences, I remembered what Mrs. Schafer had really meant. She told me she died of a heart attack some years ago. That was when Kristy first fell in love with me, and I had a cold.

“I know,” I said, remembering how much Kristy must have meant to me all those years ago. Well, I think that saying was more than enough to keep me warm. Kristy really must have meant it to me.

“Hi,” Kristy said into the phone. “Just one more time,” and before I knew it, I reached into my vest and pulled a Nancy Drew book with a list of secrets I’d discovered over the years. I opened it up and put it in the pocket of my sweater.

“Uh-oh,” I said, just as I slid in and took the book off my lap.

“Come on, Claudia,” said Kristy, looking up urgently from the book. “There’s a secret here. It’s from a doctor. You know it’s not right. No way can I explain it properly.” Before I could answer, Kristy grabbed my book and pulled it aside. “Do you know who this doctor is?” She asked. Soon afterward she opened the book again, and this time, instead of Dr. Barrett, she had Dr. Arnold.

“Um, Mrs. Schafer?” I said.

We clicked, and soon after that Mrs. Schafer had left without telling anyone.

“Oh, come on. You know the secret.”

Kristy, who was sitting next to me on the shelf in the hallway, shook her head. “It was Dr. Barrett.”

“Oh, what?” I asked.

“I’d heard he’s supposed to be there. He’s supposed to be with the New York City Ballet (the Royal Ballet), and all the Ballets in Europe.”

Kristy opened the book with a thoughtful glance at the bookseller I’d been sitting for.”I saw a look on Dr. Barrett’s face and that of Dr. Schafer, not entirely surprised at all. So the book was in my best interest.

But the book didn’t rest for long. My stepsister, Dawn, asked me if I was taking this ballet class, and I told her no. Dawn hung up and smiled.

Then we started talking about our new friends. As ever when we think another member of the BSC is around, I try to make sure that we are all on the same page about those important subjects. “Hi, everyone,” I said.

“Yeah? Really?” asked Kristy, looking at Kristy, who was sitting next to me.

“Oh, I can’t take it anymore!” I replied honestly. “Kristy, you’re going to need that class. We’re in real rehearsals right now.”

“Oh, all right,” said Kristy, who was just about to make a face. “I don’t want to miss this opportunity to introduce myself and your other friends.” But before I could say such things, I grabbed the book from Kristy’s lap and started writing.

“Hi, everybody!” I said. I was ready to introduce myself and Claudia. But I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to introduce my very best friends, all the girls (and boys) who love ballet.

My best friends are Anna, the BSC secretary, and Stacey, the BSC treasurer.

Stacey is so cute, she’s Japanese-American. She has beautiful almond-shaped eyes, and she often wears sparkly sparkly clothes. On Stacey the sparkly was “the best color that ever happened.” That summer she was wearing black leather pants, a white shirt with a black vest, black silk underwire over the top that hung over the ankle, and black ankle boots.
