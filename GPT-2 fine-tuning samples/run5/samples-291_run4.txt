 “’s job and said hello to Mr. Stevenson. “I’ll get him.” Mr. Stevenson grinned at Kristy, and her house immediately sprang.

“All right, guys,” I said into the phone as Mr. Stevenson hung up and said, “Kristy,” that I’d rather not. Her house is packed. I don’t have anything left over and it’s all I have left. I’ll check it out and let you know.”

Mallory frowned. “Okay,” she said. “Just sit in your own little mansion. All right. Just one more day. All right, girls.”

The first thing I did was call Claudia’s mom. “Hi, everybody,” I said into the phone. “I want to give you a little history lesson tonight, Claud.”

Claudia, who is really shy, doesn’t care much about school. She just wants to be herself and makes sure she doesn’t have any kind of rude or unruly boyfriend.

But Claudia just happens to be the only person in my class who truly understands what it would be like to have the chance to have your best friend cry at the end of a lesson. She says it best by taking responsibility for everything you do and fixing it. “I won’t ever do anything stupid like that again.”

Claudia is stubborn. She can’t help reminding people that we’re all good kids.

“But you can’t,” said Jessi, trying her hardest not to blush, “You can’t.”

Jessi, the BSC’s BSC vice-president, isn’t one of us very good kids. She’s an overachiever. She was in eighth grade when our family moved across town to Watson’s, and she has such a good imagination that she knew she had to leave for good. She’s so smart.

Jessi grew up in a big house. She has tons of wild talent, including art. She’s artistic enough to make a person smile.

Jessi loves to write and illustrate and illustrate and illustrate and write. Some of her art projects have been really hit-and-miss. For instance, an idea that was actually her idea was one that was already in the mind of Kristy. She’s always in the mix to come up with a cool idea, and once she’d chosen it, she says she got creative. Maybe someday Jessi will be able to draw and write herself every day — something she’s been dying to do.

Jessi loves to read and write, and she’s one of the best young kids in school. Jessi, like me, is in sixth grade. She’s an English major. She takes it up a notch by reading in a different language than her older brothers, Logan and Sam. And she’ll be a great student — but she’ll never be able to read or write in her own language. (I mean it, she’ll never make it to school.)

Jessi’s great, too. She’s the oldest kid in her family — but she’s the happiest one. Well, actually, because in fact, Jessi is the youngest. She’s seventeen years old (as of next Tuesday), and she will probably be about to turn nineteen when she’s actually allowed to wear her younger self’s clothes, as she is of today. No, Jessi did not dream of becoming a full-time writer or an illustrator of children’s books when seventh grade began.

Jessi’s not a dreamer. She’s a real person. She looks very much like one, as if she were one big, long, jet-black hair. Jessi, like Watson, is very much like Watson. She’s the most sophisticated person I know, with huge legs, jet-black hair, big almond eyes, and a strong personality.

Jessi had to hide her jet-black hair and blue eyes from her class. When she was in sixth grade, her father moved her back to Manhattan, to her dad’s mansion. Her mother moved back and she went into the mansion, but then Abby moved away, too. So Jessi’s Aunt Cecelia moved in, too, along with Claudia. Jessi’s grandmother, Nannie, moved in, too. They got Jessi’s grandmother and she married this nice guy named Watson Brewer. But she still has this big,
