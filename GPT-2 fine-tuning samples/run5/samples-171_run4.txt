�’s room, her room, her family’s place (in the house) with the rest of us (she’s a private student).”

“If we really wanted to be the best …” Abby asked.

“No …” Claudia answered. “We were trying hard to be the best.”

“What?” asked Kristy. “Why not?”

“I’ll just tell you what happened.” Stacey said.

We were all surprised when Stacey told us about some very important stuff. For one thing, Abby’s mother died a long time ago, when Stacey and her grandmother moved here from New York City. Then Stacey came to Stoneybrook and she and Abby moved into her aunt’s house. That’s why they went to California for the summer, just to be close to each other a little. Stacey also has a big special move. So she’s going to a new place and it won’t be a long trip, and when Stacey returns to New York, she also moves back to Stoneybrook. And in a couple of days she’ll be a baby!

“And what happened to that mother who’d really been crazy?” asked Stacey. “No one was crazy after all.”

We giggled at the last word.

“You know this old fairy tale that we always tell our kids from age six to fifteen?” Kristy said.

“Oh, what ’s that?” asked Abby.

“It’s the story about a fairy-tale thief named Marguerite Henry who goes into a house and finds what looks like a big treasure, and then hides it all in his room.”

“Where, exactly, did he hide it?” asked Stacey.

“He’s hiding the treasure,” Jessi said.

“Wow,” said Claudia slowly, “that’s awesome!”

“I’d like to share it with you,” said Mal, “and tell you what it says.”

This was how a lot of the club members would handle the problem, even though they are both pretty stupid about mysteries. We’ll have to wait until they finally are adults to tell them what’s really happening.

“This is a mystery and it’s being solved,” said Kristy, who is the club secretary.

“Okay,” said Abby at last.

“Kristy!” Abby and Mallory cried.

“Kristy,” Jessi said indignantly.

“Oh, I guess there’s plenty of good news, right?” said Claudia.

“Okay,” said Jessi. “Then tell us about it.”

“It’s a mystery,” Kristy told everybody.

Kristy and Jessi are not very good friends, either, and we both knew it would be dangerous. But they had to be very careful, because we all knew they would be scared.

“This is a mystery and it’s being solved?” Jessi asked.

“I guess there’s plenty of good news,” said Mallory. “And then tell us about it.”

“Okay,” said Mallory. “Just tell us about it.”

“Okay,” I said. “And just for fun, too.” I began writing down the details in the notebook.

In that moment, Abby and I had been doing things differently, and I was becoming very tired of being the girl who had to learn everything. (The last thing I wanted to do before the meeting had even started was do a story about a woman, since it just didn’t seem right.)

“Okay,” I said. “Now I look forward to it.”

I opened my notebook with a note asking us to read some of the information in it.

“The story of the mystery is about a man named Thomas Henry, who is a millionaire and a great athlete, and he's got to spend money to get there.”

“Yeah,” I said. “A millionaire doesn't go overboard with sports. He goes overboard with other things, too.”

One thing we know about Thomas is that he’s smart, and very strong. Sometimes
