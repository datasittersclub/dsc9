======== SAMPLE 1 ========
, and a boy named Logan Bruno, also known as Laine.

The movie I was thinking of was about Logan's new favorite sport, softball. Me, maybe. I'm great at sports, but I love sports. I was really looking forward to playing on a team whose members are all real friends.

Me. Logan. That was him. We played a couple of games, then Mr. Krushers practice.

Mr. Krushers, if you don't remember correctly, is the school that coaches the most famous team in the state. They won a preseason game there before the Krushers took on a nonprofessional rival this week. (I was lucky to spot that team called Pizza Express for the Krushers, which is what I call this “regular business” group.) The Krushers play all the time on weekends and on Mondays and Wednesdays, and I know they sometimes get a lull with Mrs. Granholm and Watson Brewer, but I wouldn't exactly call them lulls, anyway.

Mr. Krusher got a job in Stamford (the closest city to Stoneybrook) when he was transferred to Stoneybrook from Stoneybrook University. That was when he became an associate BSC member. (That's the usual job for an associate BSC member, I guess.) The associate BSC (that’s what associate members call for) acts as an extra BSC member whenever he or she isn’t full-time. He or she is busy with several extracurricular activities. I’ll tell you what I do — in terms of sports. I try to keep at least one close eye on all our jobs. For instance, at a BSC meeting. That’s when Mr. and Mrs. Granholm announced their surprise arrival at Stoneybrook Middle School. “We’re so glad to have them on board,” Mrs. Granholm said. (It’s true, she did not call.)

I don’t know if you’ve heard that. Associate members don’t usually come to meetings, but they’re always a big help. That’s what makes it such a good thing that Dawn, Jeff, Mary Anne, and me, who are junior officers, and only allowed to sit on after school and on weekends (except for our BSC meetings), are all so popular. We all like to talk about our jobs and be able to tell our friends about them.

Another BSC rule is that all club practices and after-school activities — homework, gym, reading, parent-text messaging, etc. — be recorded on a master calendar. (Guess what. The calendar is full of schedules that everyone has to follow and schedule all their own after-school activities in it. It’s even full of stuff we hardly ever do.)

Besides these other duties, Dawn has to attend meetings and baby-sit, and she has to be in good stead with a capital C, a half-formed B, and a capital A. Some of her spelling (which she puts together with great care) and vocabulary skills (which she honably uses — as the oldest member of the club) must be honed into the highest possible quality. Her parents — Dawn’s parents aren’t mired in the Thomas/Brewer/Exeter/Swinney debate. They’re overtones or allergies. Dawn is pretty stubborn (she even now refuses to eat red meat and she even admits she could eat red meat), and, for that matter, intolerant of anything but dairy. (Dishonest. Her parents think vegetarianism is a natural disease.)

When Dawn comes into the room, and she stares out the window (there’s nothing but fear and horror at school about her not knowing school, and not wanting to — I think she’s learned to be quiet and be quiet but not loud. It’s not difficult to see why her parents want to change — they’re very close, and Dawn’s mother is divorced.) She looks younger and calmer each day.)

Just as I was trying to process this news, my clock clicked to 5:28.

There. The BSC meets! That’s right. Everybody’s first call of the meeting was CluelessCow. That was when I announced that I was ready to join. I was pretty sure I wasn’t ready, but when I finally said that I was cool, I said so in a really cool way. “All ready, CluelessCow?” I asked, alluding to the fact that I’d taken over my old job of being your unofficial treasurer.

“Sure!” replied Kristy, sounding as if she hadn’t said that. “I still have
