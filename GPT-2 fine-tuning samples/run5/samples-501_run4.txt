 but he’s not the kind of guy to mow lawns. Instead, he likes to decorate his houses and his room and his bikes and his junk food. He keeps the Kid-Kits stocked even though the Brewers pay dues every time he buys something new, so they don’t see all that much of it. They have lots of neat things they want to hide from their neighbors.

Anyway, Kristy had grown up in the Stoneybrook neighborhood (right here in Stoneybrook). Then she grew up in New Hope, New Jersey. Here, her dad and his wife (or wife, as they call him) moved out to live in their big, old farmhouse. That was when Kristy and her father and brother — Robert and Karen — decided to split up. Kristy’s mother (mother, and grandmother) stayed in the farmhouse, and then they moved away (but not as fast as Mr. and Mrs. Thomas). And when Karen and her brother, David Michael, moved back to Stoneybrook (their grandmother moved in), Kristy’s house was also part of the big house — and just a few houses away from the big barn.

Kristy, her mother, and her younger brother (and possible stepsister) Sam moved to Stoneybrook when they were nine and two-and-a-half. They moved into an old farmhouse that had been built in 1764.

Mary Anne Spier moved into the house in the middle of the 1700s. She’s Kristy’s older sister, Anne. Her younger brother, David Michael, moved back to England in search of work. And guess who Kristy’s best friend, Mary Anne Spier, was married again, this time to one of Watson Brewer’s other best friend, Dawn Schafer. Watson Brewer is the father of two kids in a much bigger family now. His stepfather is Watson’s mom. They split up because the Thomases don’t want to give up Dawn and Mary Anne’s Mary Anne. They wanted to adopt Dawn’s younger sister Jessica, who is two and a half. But their choice wasn’t great. It was really too difficult for them to see what was wrong with them. Watson and his wife split up. Mary Anne moved back to England, followed by her parents, who were divorced. Soon after her move, Mary Anne had seven best friends. And even though Mary Anne has her ups and downs, she is an individual. Not that anyone is perfect. But one thing she is certainly not — a perfect example of that is personality.

She has this intense personality. She can be bossy and domineering. Can she be? Can she find the heart to carry herself to a sporting event and not feel out-paddled by a pack of fat cats? There’s something about her that you can pick up from the record book. I think she’d love to take a baby-sit job. She’s constantly thinking up baby-sitting schemes, and she gets all booked up every minute or so. She even received some money she needed to keep going to our meetings.

The other good member of our club is Jessi Ramsey. She and Kristy are best friends and love horse reading so much. But Jessi is not into mysteries or ghost stories. She’s always making up mysteries and she has a few extra mysteries when she gets around to reading them. And she’s good at just taking things for a spin. She is very athletic, definitely built for a professional soccer player. She has a little over a kilos (a half) of strength (in other words, a pretty face) in her body. She’d do well in a soccer player. Another strength woman is Jessi, of which I’ll tell you about the one who is not a soccer star.

Jessi is African-American. Her skin is reddish-brown with dark lashes and delicate features. She’s athletic and good at sports, so we don’t see too much of her in soccer. Jessi’s older sister Margo is of European descent (they came from Africa). They are the oldest of the four brothers, Bart and Sam. (Bart and Sam are seven kids.) They have a little brother named Philip, who happens to be extremely cool. But mostly Jessi is quiet. She’s the only blonde girl in Stoneybrook. She’s quiet because she can find nothing funny or sad about having blonde hair.

We also had an overflow of business when Kristy became vice-president. She had collected dues from us associate members and passed them around. She did it this way — by drawing a bunch of us into the room. That way, people would talk and decide where to sit. Plus
