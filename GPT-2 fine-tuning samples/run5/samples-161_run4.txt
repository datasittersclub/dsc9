 contacts with their own contacts from the last day, so that if we don’t do our best, the person we sit for can decide which one of us can’t go on vacation. I’m sure I’ll never miss a meeting with another person of that same age.

Maybe Kristy got the idea for the program if it’s too boring to mention the name of a client. Maybe he’s a new client. Maybe he needs someone not so familiar with Kristy. But that would be insulting, and there’s a reason it was named after Thomas Edison.

Kristy thinks the term Kristy refers to some kind of person or thing. It’s an accurate description of Kristy. He likes people who are sophisticated; or of special talents like math; or of special qualities, like writing or photography. In an alternate universe, he doesn’t think of me as a person.

That can be tough sometimes, but I think he’s an individual who has a clear idea.

When I first met Mr. Thomas, I had no idea that people could be so different from each other. You just can’t help it. Kristy would laugh at you. He used to have trouble understanding the way people operate on Earth, but now he’s more in touch with his own mind and his own feelings. Kristy is the first of us members of Stoneybrook Middle School (yes, we still use him) to take a sitter who’s driving the bus, for example.

Kristy has always been a big baby-sitter, so it’s no wonder he sometimes feels shy when we meet. (He’s had to take over someone’s job, of course.) He doesn’t always get it, though. Sometimes she is so moved by his personality and style. Kristy is not really a big talker, and sometimes I think she underestimates the differences between people when they get too comfortable in one another. (It might be a good thing Kristy had more energy when she’d been in the club than it was when she left.)

Kristy is really shy, but she’s great at telling you. Also, you know, the best ideas come from people who don’t seem to understand you. Kristy is not dumb, though, and she doesn’t tend to shy away from people who aren’t her age. That, of course, is partly a result of her older sister, Janine Kishi, who grew up in New York City. (I’m not entirely sure what Janine is, but she likes to talk. She has a funny look to her face, or to her makeup, etc.).

Kristy’s always taking the shortest possible cut of work, even when she wants to. It’s not that she hates to, though. When I asked her what was wrong with her and she cut a straight answer.

She started talking about her parents and then stopped trying to convince her.

"But they haven’t had their ups and downs," she said.

I asked her if she understood.

Kristy couldn’t explain things, but she usually does. Her idea of a good time is taking time off, or going to school, or going away. That doesn’t usually happen naturally, since Kristy is an individual and she can take any of those things. Sometimes I like to think of Kristy as a person who is both sensitive and sensitive, while also understanding people just fine.

She might seem like a complicated person, but I think she’s an individual with a lot of personality. She comes into the room in the most casual clothes I’ve ever seen. She seems like a person with a steady supply of energy, but there are times when that energy just isn’t there.

You could practically hear her say something like, “Oh, okay, but I won’t be back in school till after that meeting.” (Kristy always insists that. She doesn’t usually show up in meetings where everyone is required to attend.)

You could hear her say again, “Oh, good. Bye. Bye. Bye.”

She was out of breath.

“But … I could take some rest in my room,” I began.

When Kristy said it, I knew she was joking. (I don’t think her voice is that sarcastic; in fact, I can tell you that all I can say is, “That’s not true.”) “You have to rest up before school starts.”

We all groaned.

“But you can still take some
