======== SAMPLE 1 ========
's the only kid in the family. She's the only one of us who's a little older than nine. (I bet the other thirteen are.) She's a real ballerina, and I like it. She takes over when our other members get tired of talking. But it's hard to take her seriously. When I was in eighth grade, Kristy was the girl in our class who'd go to bed fast and never ask her parents to change their minds after we were done getting used to it! Also, since Kristy is an only child we were more likely to take a sitting job if we knew that Kristy would have a really good, stable boyfriend.

That's Kristy, of course.

So is Abby the other new member?

Mary Anne Spier was already there with her. Kristy was always coming on the bus, and she was always making room for Mal and Jessi. This was a really good thing for the club. That's all you have to know about the newest member. It must have been Mary Anne Spier, but I don't know how they can tell.

Mary Anne is the most creative person in our club. She's one of those great kids. (She's an awesome student, a terrific talent, and one of the most talented in the world. She's also smart, and a terrific athlete — something Mary Anne has said many times.) The school year isn't just about her, that's what. She wants to be a children's book writer/illustrator and illustrator someday. She also has an amazing imagination with drawings, stories, and stories of animals and plants, and of course, ghosts. She wants to write and illustrate children's books someday.

In fact, I already told you, Mary Anne is the only club member with a digital camera. That means she doesn't have to worry about seeing it every day, or buying a new one every other week.

I know that sounds stupid, but it also doesn't sound healthy to Mary Anne. As I've said before, she's a very organized person, but then she was born into this very broken family and she grew up here in Stoneybrook. She grew up in New York City, and she's the only sister. Now she lives here with her mom, brother, and father. She's a natural leader, and she's even a fantastic ballet dancer. She's also a talented musician, which makes her a good athlete. The only time she has trouble is when she wants to be in a band, when she's performing with friends.

Since I went off to California to see my dad in California, I decided to be an actual, live musician.

I was at the beginning of a rehearsal for the new Baby-sitters Club when I heard about all this happening. I jumped on it. I didn't know how to act. I couldn't stand the music. I couldn’t stand the music. I tried to think of something to play the piano, which was loud enough for the whole family to hear. Maybe the radio station or the children’s books. But I couldn’t think of anything else to do besides sit. I tried my best to think of something funny. But I couldn’t do it. It happened that one day the BSC president, Sharon McLelland, thought something funny. She had a secret boyfriend. He’s a killer. Sharon’s a real soul. You know what? She always hides her family secrets. I was jealous. When I was in California, that was the beginning of my secret boyfriend.

My secret boyfriend was a guy with a lot of work. He just happened to be a guy who was pretty good at his job. He was a really good, hard-working guy. At the time, he was only doing housework, but that changed now that he and Sharon were getting older, so I guess that’s when I felt left out.

“We really need more people to baby-sit at restaurants,” Kristy thought. “I know that’s not true, but I know everyone wants more kids.”

I didn’t say anything. Maybe I said, “We need more adults to baby-sit at restaurants,” but I was only thinking about the new club.

“We really need more kids!” Abby shrieked, and I felt a big smile on my face.

I wasn’t sure I should have said no. I could feel myself loosening up a little. I wondered if it might be a good thing they were going away so we were back in town together. “Maybe in a year,” I said, “he’s going to be older.”

Our little organization was great news, not only for Abby, who had grown
