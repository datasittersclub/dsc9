�’s job was simply to watch over Kristy.”

“Kristy is our vice-president,” I said. I was sure Mary Anne hadn’t expected a little of Mary Anne.

She was certainly not the happiest person. She was the most chaotic, I guess. (And Mary Anne is sad, just as she is happy). Mary Anne’s a sad, sad person. She’s a person who gets a little sad. Mary Anne’s a person who thinks she has a role to play and a responsibility to carry on. She’s a person who always looks for ways to make a statement. She’s a person who knows what it takes to win people’s attention.

To me, Mary Anne’s an amazing person, a perfect example. She’s extremely self-confident, and she’s never once let her fear or shyness get in the way of anything. She is determined to be a real world champion. The idea of a title change was something she had to think about. Would the title change work for her? Would she have to be so strict with her body language? (For instance, would she have to be so careful with her hair or her makeup?). And if anything was going to have to change for her, would she want to make changes first? I mean, would she even want to know? She would be an independent girl who is sure of herself.

Mary Anne just loves to write and illustrate and is very talented. Especially when she’s contributing to an amazing children’ softball team called Kristy’s Krushers.

Mary Anne’s family isn’t huge. She has a lot of siblings, including a stepbrother, a stepbrother, and an aunt (a stepdad), plus a stepbrother and a nieces and nephew, plus a stepbrother’s grandmother, a nieces’ and, on the plus side, a two-year-old sister who’s adopted from Vietnam, and another younger sister.

What about her younger sister, who has her own bedroom because Kristy used to live across the street from her, and is our alternate officer. We use hers during times when we’re overloaded with other responsibilities. She’s our only resident full-time member, which is a good thing, as she’s already been here for a while.

“We’ll get to them,” Mary Anne had warned us.

Mary Anne opened the package. “Hi, Kristy. I’ve got two things on my mind for Kristy’s next meeting on Wednesday,” she noted. “I’ve got a book with pictures of these kittens on it, and a short story.”

“The Little Baby Ties,” exclaimed Kristy. “Well, I thought it would be funny, but it was almost too funny for Kristy.”

“Well, Kristy,” said Mary Anne quickly. She went on to say, “You have to think about all of this carefully, because the truth is, I wouldn’t really bother with the book if I knew it was going to be funny. Honestly, you’d probably just read it anyway.”

“The New York Times Best Seller,” I answered her. My brain, I thought as I read her thought for the next three sentences. “A little more life than I bargained for.”

“Is that why you didn't do the book last summer?” (Mary Anne had to be careful not to say she was talking about a book she was writing.)

“I guess I tried.”

“Well, you really couldn’t. But you did.”

“I wasn’t really trying because you needed a little help.”

“You couldn’t have done that,” said Mary Anne. “I mean, you didn’t do well in school.”

“You couldn’t have tried that,” I reminded her.

Kristy shook her head. “Well, I wouldn’t have taken that kind of test.”

“The test? What test?” I asked.

“A very good idea,” said Mary Anne. “That’s why I couldn’t take that, Mary Anne.”

“I mean, I was in trouble in school,” she began. “But I was supposed to improve the spelling and spelling and spelling,” she paused, then
