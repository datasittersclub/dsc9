 too for the amount of practice she had to offer.

Stacey, who is our vice-president, has a pretty strong conservative position. She's a big mouth, if you can guess right. Maybe it comes from her strict, ultra-conservative, ultra-meets-the-fries way of thinking. (I know, I know.) And she may have more to lose if her family decides that she should get an M.I.T., which means that her body will start acting up and her mind going crazy when she eats broccoli or tofu.

Stacey is originally from New York City, though she moved here shortly after her father's divorce. That's because her parents divorced. Stacey became really big-time New Yorker club vice-president, and that was when I joined the BSC. I guess it's partly why we became more and more regular and efficient.

Our vice-president isn't only our official secretary but her name is Dawn Schafer. Dawn's an only child, so the baby brother, Robert, is a big deal. (Robert's family moved to Stoneybrook, too.) There are a total of seven of us in the BSC, with Kristy and Mary Anne (Mary Anne's mom and Kristy's dad) at the vice-president's house.

Dawn doesn't talk too much, since she's addicted to junk food. Her family, her friends, and her junk food all make her feel out of sorts. Dawn is a diabetic, which is very serious for her. This may be why she's got a big mouth like her. Her parents are divorced; her dad's company now makes her go to the doctor, but since she's always looking for work, Dawn often has to watch her father for work problems or after-school activities.

Dawn's also very organized — she's also a real leader. She makes sure we get organized. For instance, we hold meetings regularly and keep on writing up our jobs in our club notebook, a journal that gives us helpful hints on what's going on with our clients. Sometimes it's also helpful in setting up sitters for new clients, by reminding them about important club business. Plus, we use Dawn's free time to talk to our clients and to write up our jobs. This is something that we do in the notebook, which is quite convenient. Dawn has been in New York several periods of time, most recently at our wedding, where she met a girl named Dawn's grandmother Dawn's brother, Jeff, also a couple of years ago. They became best friends, and that got the matter out of the way.

Dawn is also a great listener, which is really helpful for our meetings. She's really sensitive and sensitive; she's also extremely sensitive and sensitive, so it really makes the club a good business.

Dawn's life has also changed a lot. That's because she was the first member of the Baby-sitters Club, which was founded by her maternal grandparents, her father, and her mother. Her family moved from what used to be a tiny house into a mansion that has since become part of a large, live-in, gated community. I mean, it's just a mansion. It's pretty quiet nowadays. Actually, Dawn and her father were divorced, and after the divorce, Dawn and her mother had a little extra time. Mr. Spier had to look for a job with an old firm he used to much success. Plus, Dawn's mother had recently begun attending the BSC, where she had a big part. Her name was Dawn, and that meant that she and her mom got an honorary BSC title. So the Spiers became honorary members.

So that's how we meet on Monday mornings. (The club also has a special meeting for that.)

Dawn's room is my headquarters. I am responsible for all the business; I have clients’ jobs; I also record the sitting jobs for our clients in our club notebook. And as we all know, the notebook is one of my great secret weapons. I can recall every single assignment I have ever written in the journal.

Dawn's room also has two record rooms. If a client calls during sitting time, or if the phone rings for an after-school or sports party, I bring up the Baby-sitters Club record book in the vice-president's chair. At the other end of the table, where we all meet, are two digital recorders. In the digital recorders is an assistant secretary; that’s what Claudia and I are called, because our desks are identical. All the recorders are there to tell us who and when to sit for what clients. We know that if a kid is sick or doesn’t have a book coming in soon (or if no one is coming to a certain neighborhood, we can call right back), we can ask our junior officers at the table.
