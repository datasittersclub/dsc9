’ll take my place and’d like to go straight to the Pikes’!"

I knew I didn’t make the right call. Maybe later I’d better get back to them.

I dashed off toward my house, holding my breath. The car was pretty full. I left Lloyd’s number seconds after I left Mallory’s house, and I ran into Claudia’s bedroom just as she headed downstairs.

Claudia, who was sitting on the bed, opened the door a little further, and we took off into the backyard.

“Hi, you guys!” Stacey called as she went into the car. “I think we saved your dance.”

“And I’m going to miss you too!” I said as I ran into Claud’s bedroom. As soon as I saw her, I gave everyone a huge hug.

Our first special dessert was a loaf of chocolated cheesecakes, which Stacey offered at the beginning of the ride. She knew my family likes sweet things like waffles and I like to have a chocolate treat on my tongue, in addition to the usual sugar-free snacks. But we did our usual fries with our treats, and we each had a glass of water.

I got out my orange juice, and Stacey opened a container of her own blue water. I don’t feel terribly thirsty, but my family does sometimes — and I don’t know exactly when — they get really, really red. I don’t care much about that, though. I pack a punch, though.

“I hope you feel up, Stace,” said Kristy. “I guess I am running out on you.”

I didn’t quite catch what she meant, but I did know that if she’d said anything, it was that she didn’t like what I was saying. Maybe because of my diabetes, or maybe because of the way I grew up, Stacey’s dislike for sports grew in some ways, sort of ways, toward acceptance. That hasn’t affected them too highly.

“If you don’t mind, I’m not going to wrestle you, Claudia,” Stacey explained. “I just thought,” she said, “if somebody calls you in a contest, they may as well call you, too. I mean, they can call you in person, and reach out to have an answer.”

Mary Anne started to giggle. “And if I don’t do my homework, I don’t get a place in the dance program, Stacey,” she added with a giggle, “and if I don’t do my homework at lunch, I get to pick up homework for the day on Thursdays —”

“Claudia, it’s three, not four, Cheez Doodles,” the clock on Claudia’s desk switched from A to A, “so go ahead,” Claudia said in her best, “but I’ll get the clock back to five-thirty.”

That was the last time anybody saw Claudia outside at lunch. I think that was because the school doesn’t have a lot of curfews, or any curfews at all, so Stacey and I ran out of the house. We’ve been friends forever, and we’re happy to have had someone to talk to.

We still sit for the Musketeers and the Krushers. It’s one of the things Stacey likes best — soccer. If she can convince someone, that person is usually Stacey McGill. Of course Stacey’s always available. We call her to see if she’s free. She’s a loyal friend and the club needs her around.

And that was when Stacey made her special lunch date special again.

“Hi, Stace,” Kristy called from the back of her math class. “Sorry I’m late,” she told her friend, David Michael. David Michael is Kristy’s other best friend. They’ve known each other since they were babies. They used to go to Stoneybrook Middle School together. Then Kristy’s dad walked out on the family, leaving Stacey and David Michael to fend for themselves.

“You guys are great!” Stacey said after a long pause, leaning against the front door. She and David Michael had arrived just as the clock clicked over five-thirty, and the digital countdown to 5-thirty had
