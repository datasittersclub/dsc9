======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I is a really sensitive girl, which is why I do what I do. And the way I dress makes me different from my sister — jeans, a T-shirt and sneakers — but what does that tell you about me? I have these little curls in my hair and a huge smile, like Claudia and Stacey.

I am the type who wears the "regular" attire. It's pretty ordinary. I have jeans, a turtleneck shirt and a sweater, and no baseball cap. I'm a dancer, which is cool compared to my dancing skills. But I have long, long, silky black hair, pale blue eyes and beautiful dark almond-shaped eyes, and I've had very little luck dressing up. The trouble is that you probably shouldn't forget the fact that you have diabetes, which basically means your body doesn't properly control how much sugar a person has to give himself or herself to get used to the idea of having to watch your sugar intake.

Luckily, I'm a natural-food addict. And to stay away from candy, I have to eat little candy. That's because my body doesn't process sugar the way it should, or at least, not quite properly. As you can imagine, eating too much can kill off your chemical system. And I know what I’ll eat. I eat anything. From pretzels to whole wheat crackers. I also eat veggie chips, kabobs, chips, and other stuff I don’t like. (They’re the snack of choice for the super-early adopters of Claud’s younger siblings.)

Claudia Kishi is the president of the Baby-sitters Club, the baby-sitting genius (in a positive way) of the group, and the BSC (that’s where all our regular members meet). You’ve never heard of her before I’ll explain the BSC to her in a minute, so go ahead, describe her. She doesn’t look familiar at all. Claud has a great sense of humor and she’s very artistic and artistic. She takes just about every picture she can find, uses her digital camera (which she acquired when her dad was married — she calls it her personal assistant, after all her other artistic talents — such as drawing baby-sitting ads or creating mysteries or kids for kids) and has even had her own TV show. Her creativity can be contagious: she loves to share her creative ideas with the world, and she even appeared on the set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer years ago and got to work on some of her mysteries.

Claudia, as you have already heard, has red hair, glasses, and braces. You’d never mistake her for a serious artist, but I know you do. Claud has always had a great artistic side. She even goes out at weekends. And sometimes when there’s a movie scheduled for TBS (Transparent, for instance), she goes to a private school.

As you might guess from her name, Claud has very little artistic aptitude. She’s the oldest of eight siblings, including triplets. Her other siblings (including her two younger brothers, Adam and Jordan), on the other hand, are either the age of five or six. Her family is very pretty, but Claud is the most stubborn of all of them. She’s also a romantic. Sometimes she cries at the movies. Her other romantic interest is her best friend, Stacey McGill. Stacey lives in Stamford (the city closest to Stoneybrook) with her brother and her mother, who is divorced. Their son, David Michael, is now nearly six years old, but at least he seems to be at a happy crossroads. His condition has improved a lot recently, but he still feels a little guilty about letting his dad treat him like a kid.

Although most of Stacey’s situation has been pretty normal, for some time her parents still treated her like a kid. Maybe that was why her younger brother, Jeff, was so strict at school — strict in fact. When David Michael was younger and his dad had an up and down time with all of her parents, things began to change for everybody. Suddenly the bad stuff wasn’t so bad, though, and, well, things were changing in Stacey’s family for the worse. Stacey died not long after David Michael was born. He had been transferred to an old farmhouse at the edge of town, where everything changed.

Before I went to Stoneybrook, I’d begun the search for a BSC member, one friend of mine named Mallory. That’s because my family moved here when I was twelve — when I met Dawn! She’s now eight, and I was invited back to join them. But first I had to find a BSC member. I decided to take
