fully. This is because my family grew up with me — and still do — in California.

So we have good stepsisters at a time. Mom is a stay-at-home mom, but I am an independent person. I just want to be around other little people who can be friendly. That means being in charge of the phone book, which is a daily job that we call the BSC. But we do it better than that, because we're the best phone bookers in the school year. And we treat everybody the same. Everyone loves everyone!

So if things weren't bad enough, Mary Anne and I are in the same class at our local elementary school. We do things the same way, though. Mary Anne and I are older than most kids — I suppose we can be best friends. We both love school — especially writing and performing. I have a problem, though. My mom does a lot of chores and, in fact, tries to tell me to write in pencil. So I take the math assignments on Fridays. Mary Anne has to. Sometimes I have to. But every now and then I have more than a little more to answer to, even if it takes me hours to write a single line of paper.

Luckily, I like the school environment (which is the good stuff!) for the best way I know how.

Mary Anne's an ordinary girl! (You know, the stuff of ordinary girls!) She plays piano, plays with instruments and keeps a notebook.

She's also a great friend. She's the one who comes up with the most creative idea for us. Sometimes, then, we have to solve mysteries of our own, or learn old ways of seeing the world (like that of Kristy Thomas when she lived in New York City). I like how she's the only one of us who can remember which characters are wearing which clothes (or in which way). Then we have to figure out what to do with our own family in case our new friends have allergies, for example, or if we have another baby. (For more information about Mary Anne's health, check out her Baby-sitters Club.)

Mary Anne's personality is just as special. It fits her very best. Even though she sometimes doesn't care very much about the house she married. She's more interested in a big family. (Her mom, who she really is, can be a lonely man sometimes.) She's also really kind toward her sister, Abby (who she met when she was three).

I know she's had a tough time in the past, but in the end she's a complete person. When she was a baby, her parents took care of her while we were in high school. Now she's not the kind of person who doesn't care much about what people think.

That's Mary Anne for you. There's plenty of stories to tell, but let's begin with the most important one, the one I said about Kristy Thomas — Mary Anne. As one of our best friends, it makes great news to see her. Mary Anne is a talented, dedicated pianist who doesn't like school. She has to be.

However, she's got talents and she's a good one.

And she's not one of the stupidest kids she knows. She seems to enjoy lessons, too. You know, in her little brother's company. She's even a member of the club, so she's easy to talk to on the phone.

Mary Anne's an old lady. She grew up only in New York City. Her parents did everything right, though. Now they're a happy, healthy family.

She's pretty, too. She has a younger sister, Janine, who's two and a half. She and her older brother Michael (who's three) live very far away. And she's Japanese-American. She'd probably say a little more about her Japanese-American background — and, like Kristy, she doesn't fit into the stereotype. Mary Anne doesn't dress exactly like Kristy. She wears her hair in a long ponytail, a silky, curly-black sweater, and black pants. She wears no shoes whatsoever, either, which is pretty interesting for a girl of her age who grew up in New York City. And she's one of the lucky ones: she's not the only one. You know, the one who's not really into school. But, hey, if you look at other parents the way you do, you'd find them pretty attractive.

You wouldn't have to be crazy! But in Mary Anne's case, there would be plenty of other interesting things to go on.

She has two younger siblings — Karen and Andrew. And she has two stepsister, Dawn. (Dawn's stepfather, Jeff, is dead, so her dad's going on vacation.)

It doesn't hurt that she and her younger
