, I think. That evening I was wearing a white leopard print leotard scarf over a short yellow-and-black leotard skirt with a red hoop earring at the front and black hoop earrings at the back. (I didn’t tie my earring to my leotard and wore it differently on certain parts.)

The day before, I’d worn a brown leotard and on one side a tie-down white jumper with a white neck ring and on the other hand, on the other side, white leotard stockings and the neckless white leopard shell. And I was wearing a short yellow belt tied to the back of my head with white-and-white striped rope attached to it. It didn’t look particularly stylish. I guess it’s the way my parents treat my sisters.

Besides style, I’m a natural athlete. I love track, baseball, swimming, swimming at all times, especially running. I love being able to swim in the ocean and never have to worry about a cramp. But I also know that being able to swim is more than just a physical activity. It’s a cultural responsibility. And being allowed to do what you want to do is something I still do more often than I used to during those early years.

At the beginning of seventh grade, Mary Anne came back to my home for Thanksgiving. Even though she wasn’t home for that long, it meant we didn’t have time to hold our families together. But we did have time for a dinner. Mary Anne was the last to pick up the phone, and she gave me the news, and I smiled and waved to her. I could tell she was still holding it open.

I handed it over and hoped she’d look at it. She could never dream, not at all. She has eight other brothers, sisters, and children. Her father died in a car wreck when Mary Anne was nine. (Mr. Spier said it was the work of a jealous person.) For two weeks, he was in California. (Mr. Spier is very busy. His family is really small. They have eight younger brothers and sisters plus a little sister and a baby brother.) It was a really tough house, but things turned out smoothly. After several weeks, Mrs. Spier married Dawn Schafer. Then, at the end of last year, Mr. Spier got a divorce. Mrs. Schafer had been a single, happy, nonparent, but her other husband, Mr. Spier, married this nice little guy named Watson Brewer. He lived in a mansion (Mr. Sprout has two kids from his previous marriage) across town, near Mary Anne, California. After he and Mrs. Schafer had grown up, Watson moved in with the Spiers. (His kids are Claire, Adam, and Jordan.) Watson just happens to be rich and very nice, so he (unlike Spier) had to part with his ten-year-old brother to raise four kids together. Then, just like with Mrs. Schafer and Mr. Spier, Watson decided he liked Mr. Spier enough to move back to live there with his dad. Then, after awhile — just by himself — he started to date Cam Geary, Mary Anne’s other boyfriend.

“Cam, you’ve never had a real boyfriend before,” exclaimed Logan. “Have you?”

“I just happened to mention that last night, the wedding was all set and our table had just heated up like a pot roast — which is what we did all day.”

“Cool!” whispered Mary Anne. She made a note of it over her braids.

“So,” said Dawn, “it’s time for the ceremony.”

Mary Anne gave him a look. “Claud,” she whispered. “And all the other BSC members, plus Jessi’s new high school sweetheart, and all the wonderful friends who have supported us in the past week.”

Claudia’s cheeks brightened. “Well, I was honored to work with you guys and to have another chance to speak at the wedding.”

“Cool!” said Claud. “I could see that this was a special celebration for all of us … all of you.”

“So great!” said Logan. “We won’t even have to think about dinner yet.”

Mary Anne rolled her eyes. “We’ll hold the wedding this very special and special!”

I did. After all, Claudia was a terrific sitter. I was the only one of us who could move from one room
