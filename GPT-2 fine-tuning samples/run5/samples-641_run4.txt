 also on a diet, and that she wants to be an author-illustrator of children's books. She is, and always will be the best artist or editor of any I’m acquainted with. She wrote Claudia’s hair. She also designed the curtains. She did a lot of decorating too. And she’s very good at putting together beautiful outfits. Claudia likes to wear funky clothes — jeans, stuff like that — and pretty much any kind of jewelry she can find (even tequila or some of that stuff). So it’s quite a outfit at that very moment, right at that very moment at the very moment when you feel totally in control.

Here’s hoping that someday we’ll meet in somewhere like the same room where Claudia lives. That place will be Claudia’s bedroom, too. She likes to be in a movie theater. And she has a special talent. To her surprise, she’s got this talent that many young artists have, too.

Claudia’s parents are divorced. They split up after Claudia and her sister, Janine, who are seven, a little more time with their parents. Claudia is allowed, though Janine has to stay home and take care of her younger sister, Claudia. The other members of the BSC, though, are her older brothers, Charlie and Sam.

The other BSC member who is divorced is Stacey McGill. She’s the treasurer of the BSC, and she also happens to be her best friend. Stacey is also an associate BSC member, which means she does lots of club jobs, like making sure everyone has a good time — which is something we all did well this meeting.

You want to know how much it costs to rent a sitter from an associate member? Just enter your BSC salary in the "uniform" column. You know the math, too.

Another thing you need to know about the club is our dues. (The treasurer is the club member, and the chief math wag.) We use the money to pay Charlie and Kristy to drive me back to my old office. (Kristy lives so far away now that she can’t use her car and her two kids for official business.) We also have to make a little extra for things we need (such as supplies for our Kid-Kits), such as part of Claudia’s phone bill and club dues. We also spend money on supplies for our Kid-Kits. And we’re supposed to pay Stacey’s brother Charlie to drive her to meetings. (I think a Kid-Kits is a box, by the way.)

There’s one last important thing about the BSC. The last official business is club meetings. Usually those are held on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons. But I’m responsible for meeting hours before school starts on Mondays. Sometimes we hold them. We used to think that was a bad idea, but now we all know it was bad.

That’s who we are. Dawn is the club secretary and Kristy is the club treasurer. The two other members of the BSC are me and Mary Anne. I’m the alternate officer, which means I can take over if I have more work than I can think through. So far, that’s been me and one other person, Jessica Ramsey. The other BSC member is Mallory Pike. She is a second-grader, and she lives on Kristy’s street.

Oh, one last thing about the record book. Dawn is responsible for writing up every meeting in detail. Then she has to look over each one for the next meeting. She has to put together a full calendar. Then she has to look at all our schedules, looking at who’s come to meetings, who’s been in a particular program, and so forth. It really is a BSC tradition to keep the book a real, full-monthfessing whizzy-dizzy record. The club notebook is another thing. (It’s another of Kristy’s great ideas.) That’s where the club notebook came in. That was another of her great ideas. We read the notebook at meetings, which makes us better sitters. Plus, we use the notebook to figure out what other jobs are most important to us. (The other club members are always nervous about sitting jobs that involve animals.) Our Kid-Kits are also our official club items.

Now we’re all here.

My room is decorated with posters of my works, puppets, dogs, and kids — everything! And I have to admit, I like art. I guess art doesn’t have to mean school. I like all the other club members, though.

I guess the most
