 experienced by me the day her dad was fired.

"Dad? What has happened to him?" asked Claudia Kishi.

"What?" whispered me. "I'm going to sit for your new mom for the next couple of weeks. See you soon, Shannon. We'll see each other in a while." She walked over and sat down next to me on her bed. "She's going away right now," she added. "I'm sure my dad’s going to be very disappointed.<|endoftext|>
"I have to wait awhile, Shannon," I admitted. The last thing I wanted was a baby. So I sat for the other guy, John. But I guess it’s better to have a boyfriend than to have two kids at once, right?

"You know, we’ve had to deal with some baby-sitting problems this year and a half," said Shannon. "When Mom met this guy who was going to be our BSC member, her heart sank. She thought it was all a big joke in the first place — and that this guy, John Kony, was going to be a really old man."

"And then she married him?" asked Kristy.

"Maybe that’s his idea of a good time to talk to me," I replied.

"She’s an awfully nice person," said Claudia. "And she was a good student and a terrific student. She got married right across town. Then she moved into the house next to her sister, who’s here and studying to be an in-state player."

"Why don’t you join the BSC?" asked Claudia, giggling at me.

I nodded. "That’s really neat."

I nodded to the others. I took a few seconds with some of the questions. "We don’t really have any good ideas, Mr. P. Korman."

"No good ideas?" asked Kristy, sitting cross-legged on the bed.

"Sure they don’t have much to offer," I added.

"All we really have is words to describe what we’ve been paying attention to so far. We don’t know anyone else who has had to do anything like that," said Claudia. "We have enough work to do in two weeks, plus some more of our regular regular jobs with clients."

"We have enough work to do in two weeks? What does that mean for our club? I don’t know. I wish it hadn’t. I think we’re going to be an even smaller club than we really are. We have a great club, but we need good people to help us run it. We just need a lot of new ones."

The audience boomed and Claudia started talking about how happy she was that she was still in the BSC. Kristy seemed annoyed. "How many of us have to do in two weeks?" she asked.

I knew we were pretty close the whole time. “One week,” I said. "I think we have enough. Just kidding. We had six members a day.<|endoftext|>
I am the shortest person in my class. I eat pretty much by the way, so I am pretty organized. We take three classes at the same time, with two regular ones in the afternoon for anyone who’s tired of being out and about the house. In my case, though, it was two courses.

“A two-course lunch for two people of the same age is a good example of planning.”

“I’ve always had two courses a week,” I replied.

“This is the best example of planning,” Kristy continued. “When I was very old school, our club members worked very hard to get by. We were pretty hard put, though. But now we’re lucky it isn’t two whole days. Even though it was two days, it wasn’t enough.”

I looked at the other members in my class, and I couldn’t believe how many students we had with us. Everyone’s a great club member. Some people might call me a pretzel — I don’t even remember any of them — but I guess it’s just that.

After I spoke to Mrs. Korman for a second, one of the other members leaned in and said, “Oh, it’s excellent. Do you know her? She and I are both thirteen years old. Our family is very big. Mrs. Korman’s home is just across town from her. “Can you guess what we were doing,’ she asked to see what she
