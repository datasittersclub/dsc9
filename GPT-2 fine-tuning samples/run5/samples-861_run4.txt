 has to be careful when offering him anything. Mary Anne is nice about supplying material, though (she has a wonderful family, but it has to be organized). She has the great gift of collecting.

The Baby-sitters Club was Kristy's idea, and she's even more amazing about it. She's one of her favorite people. Kristy's a dynamo, and Kristy is like lightning in a bottle. She's brash, doesn't care what people think, and doesn't care what children think. Kristy's a little bossy and impatient, but she's great with kids. Plus, she's a tomboy who loves sports.

Kristy has curly blonde hair, glasses (they're red, not blue) and braces. She looks great in those two respects.

Kristy's stepfather brought her up on her own. She'd barely even known him until she met her mother. Kristy's mother is a pretty big personality (although Kristy's father is a regular gringo). Kristy's mom married again not long after Mr. Thomas got married here in Stoneybrook.

Kristy's mother became a regular gringo when her husband left. (She's still a regular gringo, though. She calls him Jack, not Carolyn, who just happens to be a regular gringo.) That left Mrs. Thomas to take care of four kids — Kristy, her two older brothers, Charlie and Sam, and two-year-old Karen and Andrew, who are identical triplets. Then there are Emily, seven, and Andrew, four. So Kristy's job is to take care of them.

"Any other business?" Mary Anne asked after she'd phoned Mallory.

"I don't think so," I said. I could feel myself blushing. We've been together as a family a lot, and we've grown close as a people. We're both pretty organized too.

"I just wanted to let you know, though, that when I get divorced tomorrow, my new wife won't be able to visit the beach in California the way I was able to. I mean, not for a few months after we move here. We don't have a vacation schedule for this summer. We'll have to stay on something else." That was all I could think about. I was leaving the door open for another summer.

Mallory smiled at me and shook her head. "She could come down to Stoneybrook tomorrow and be with me," she said. "I have a feeling she won't be able to get a job."

It was good to hear Mallory think the same thing. She was vice-president of the BSC, which means she's responsible for providing baby-sitting for the kids we sit for.

You would not believe Mallory. She's small, really, with brown eyes and brown hair that gleams colorfully from the long sheath of her derby hat.

You wouldn't know it from the way she looks. In fact, I doubt I would ever find out who she is. She grew up in Stoneybrook, but her dad was killed in a car accident some years ago. Mallory never realized what it was like to be a little kid in Stoneybrook.

Luckily for us, she grew up with two older brothers, Charlie and Sam, and a younger brother, David Michael. Mallory didn't grow up without both of her parents, and she and Mal are the oldest, so maybe that has a lot to do with it. She also has asthma and has allergies to both things (my family has an asthma attack that can't be treated, so that's why she has to carry an inhaler with her when we take our work trips there usually).

There are two other members of the BSC (Karen is the other, and is the only one who doesn't baby-sit). Last month was no exception. She got very tired after work and felt all wacky and guilty for not having enough calories for my meals. Even now she eats the stuff I give her. But it's no big deal when she wants to eat healthy food, and she chose organic strawberries and carrots with organic chard. That was wonderful, even though she has to hide her junk food. Recently she was especially interested in Ho-Ho's, one of her favorite foods, because one of the junk food is made into a snack food with tofu, avocado, pineapple, and coconut topping it.

"Hey, Dawn!" said Stacey McGill, who is the club's treasurer. Stacey's hair had grown out to shoulder length. She had walked proudly into the room to talk about the Baby-sitters Club and to announce that there had been a client for our Baby-sitters Club that afternoon. "He's in California now — not too long ago," she had told him. "His name's Joe Bur
